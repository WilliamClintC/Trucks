regular supplementation by matthew bender & company inc its successor in interest beginning with supplement no 34 municipal will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 34 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a subjectmatter index with complete crossreferencing locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers this supplement brings the to date passed  municipal capital circle sw tallahassee fl 32310 8002622633 how to use your code this code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials city employees and private citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by number section if applicable and year example  1992 beginning with supplement no 34 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end these history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index statutory references the statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality as the statutes are revised these references will be updated crossreference table when a code is based on an earlier codification the crossreference table will help users find older or prior code references in the new code the crossreference table is located near the end of the code under the tabbed divider tables this table lists the prior code section in the column labeled prior  and the new code section in the column labeled herein as of supplement no 34 this table will no longer be updated disposition table to find a specific ordinance in the code turn to the section called tables for the disposition table this very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code the table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance if the ordinance is codified the chapter or chapters will be indicated example 204 612 904 if the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified such as budgets taxes annexations or rezones the disposition will be special if the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code usually at the direction of the municipality the disposition will be not codified other dispositions sometimes used are tabled pending number not used or missing beginning with supplement no 34 this table will be replaced with the table and disposition list table and disposition list beginning with supplement no34 a table and disposition list has been added for use in tracking legislative history located in the back of this volume this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance

variance procedures are as follows 1 nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this chapter of the ordinance are based on the general principal of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the board of supervisors to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate if upon review the administrator of fema determines that community practices indicate a pattern of issuing variances that is inconsistent with the objectives of sound flood plain management the community may be suspended from the national flood insurance program 2 appeal board a the board of supervisors as established by title 18 of this code shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter b the board of supervisors shall hear and decide appeals if filed within thirty 30 days from any decision or determination when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the administrator of this chapter c those aggrieved by the decision of the board of supervisors may appeal such decision to the appropriate court as provided in the nevada revised statutes d in passing upon such applications the board of supervisors shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards etc specified in other sections of this chapter and 1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 the necessity to the facility of a riverfront location where applicable  6 the availability of alternative locations for the proposed uses that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 the relationship of the proposed use to the citys master plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  11 the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that  1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates  2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the local floodplain administrator in the office of the carson city recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears as an exception on the title of the affected parcel of land f the local floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency 2 conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvements and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf 12 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of administration and provisions for flood hazard reduction of the ordinance have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf 12 acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in definitions upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic

elimination of nonconforming offpremises signs natural deterioration illegal billboards and offpremises signs are public nuisances and unless the status is changed under this chapter to nonconformance shall be removed and abated in the manner provided by law it is intended that these regulations 1 impose reasonable standards on the number density size height and location of billboards and

of the characteristics and purposes listed in this section these characteristics and purposes tend to describe the business practices and other arrangements of the persons who are engaged in the business of offpremises advertising or of persons who use offpremises advertising in connection with their business and nonbusiness advertising and therefore tends to describe the types of signs intended to be regulated by this chapter 1 signs on which advertising space is sold leased given or otherwise made available by the sign owner to other members of the public at large for the purpose of displaying the other persons message the sign owner may or may not but typically does receive revenue or other value or benefits for allowing other persons to use the advertising space the sign owner may or may not but typically does not own the land occupied by the sign  2 signs which do not advertise the interests of the person who owns or occupies the land on which the sign is located but which do advertise the interests of persons elsewhere the sign message is determined by the sign owner or his lessee without regard for and sometimes adverse to the interests of the owners of the sign site  3 signs owned and controlled by a person other than the person who owns or controls the land on which the sign is located  4 signs which advertise interests or uses not present at the location of the sign  d no preferences allowed to particular types of messages 1 commercial use under this chapter is not determined by making reference to the content of the sign message to determine whether the sign advertises a commercial message or a noncommercial message noncommercial messages are those usually considered to be for example ideological religious or political in nature a noncommercial message does not cause a billboard or offpremises sign to no longer be a commercial use under this chapter commercial use is determined by making reference to the overall practices and arrangements of the sign owners and sign site owners in making the sign available to others 2 nothing in this chapter may be construed to allow a commercial message any preference or greater protection over a noncommercial message or to allow one 1 noncommercial message any preference or greater protection over another noncommercial message any reference to the message content of a billboard or offpremises

division 5  historic district preface carson citys historic district is often thought of as a victorian village frozen in time nothing could be further from the truth carson citys historic district reflects a unique variety of ongoing economic social and political circumstances the district provides a link with nevadas past buildings dating from the early 1860s to the 1950s modest in scale means and architectural pretense these buildings document nevadas development as a state and give carson city its unique character the value of carson citys historic resources was formally recognized by the carson city board of supervisors in may 1982 with the creation of the historic district and the designation of an architecture review committee renamed the historic resources commission hrc it is comprised of property owners building design and preservation professionals by ordinance the carson city historic resources commission is charged with maintaining the overall architectural character of the district and properties listed or eligible for the national register of historic places within the guidelines recommended by the us department of the interior national park service carson city adopted these guidelines to protect and preserve its heritage the commission recognizes that carson citys future prosperity lies in a balanced approach to economic development and historic preservation these objectives are not mutually exclusive the commission realizes that it is necessary to maintain a balance between preservation and utility this section explains the review policies and design guidelines of the commission when reviewing projects within the district whether involving historic structures or new construction  part 2005 51  introduction the architectural styles found in carson citys historic district span approximately 100 years from the 1860s to the 1960s examples of ten architectural styles found in the historic district were selected less common styles in the district have not been included however the buildings representing these styles are equally important to the districts character between the citys founding in 185 and 187 the greek revival and gothic revival styles were popular after 1874 four victorian period styles were adopted the ltalianate second empire queen anne and stickeastlake styles by the turn of the century changing architectural fashions prompted period revivals and modern architecture the period revivals included colonial classical mediterranean and english country the modern styles included the bungalow craftsman a uniquely american creation and art decomodern these styles were popular in carson city up to world war ii architectural styles form a system which describes the design of the building  its scale mass proportions height rhythm and ground plan  and the architectural details  such as roofline exterior cladding windows entrances ornamentation and interior features a house of a particular style is not just a random collection of parts  all the design elements work together to form a specific image most buildings do not possess all the characteristics of a particular style carson city buildings are vernacular interpretations of architectural styles which include the essential form of the style and selected details many houses within the historic district reflect the influence of more than one style for example a house which was built in the 1860s may have the form of the greek revival style but the original form was enlarged and embellished in the 1880s with italianate style ornamentation similarly a house constructed in the 1880s could combine the popular queen anne and the stickeastlake styles in its design the designs of a large number of buildings within the historic district do not fall into a discrete style these vernacular houses provided basic shelter for their occupants and were probably built without much regard for the current architectural fashion these buildings are important to the ambience of the historic district and provide us with a balance between the modest and the spectacular vernacular houses represent building traditions handed down from one generation to another modified by technology local building materials and geography their basic design and modest details are their identifying features the characterdefining features of a particular house should be recognized and protected rehabilitation features which define a buildings style and character also contribute to the overall character of the historic district  part 2005 development

affordable small house for the middle class the designs in wood or brick provided an easy to build affordable house for the growing middleclass who were moving to the suburban fringe of cities the homes were also the first to include a detached garage the craftsman style represented an independent western movement in american architecture its guiding force was the english arts and crafts movement which rejected the mass reproduction and mediocre design associated with the industrial revolution in favor of the beauty and honesty of traditional handcraftsmanship and natural materials the craftsman ideas were widely disseminated in the pages of the craftsman magazine published from 1901 to 1916 by the furniture maker and designer gustave stickley the style was adapted for countless small houses and bungalows but found its most sophisticated expression in the work of pasadena architects greene and greene craftsman details often included inglenooks builtin wood cabinets wood beam

styles by diminishing the boundaries between formal and informal spaces ranch houses might still have a formal living room based on the parlor concept but more often the dining room was situated between the kitchen and the new family room with its open kitchenliving area the ranch was specifically geared to casual entertaining another key point was the desirable indooroutdoor living promised

horizontal lines lowpitched roof and overhanging eaves of the ranch house but added a 2story unit intercepted at midheight by a 1story wing to make 3 floor levels of interior space an elaborate theory of interior planning grew around this form families were felt to need 3 types of interior spaces quiet living areas noisy living and service areas and a sleeping area the split level form made it possible to locate these on separate levels the lower level usually housed the garage and commonly the noisy family room with its television which was becoming a universal possession the midlevel wing contained the quiet living areas and the upper level the bedrooms 1 of several examples of a splitlevel home in carson city this is located on westview at the periphery of the historic district

preserving those portions and features of the property which are significant to its historic architectural and cultural values the standards for rehabilitation are as follows 1 a property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials features spaces and spatial relationships 2 the historic character of a property will be retained and preserved the removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features spaces and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided 3 each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time place and use changes that create a false sense of historical development such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties will not be undertaken 4 changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be retained and preserved 5 distinctive materials features finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved 6 deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced where the severity of deterioration requires replacement

lot  materials exterior siding should reflect the prevailing style of the neighborhood a vertical or diagonal style siding should not be used when the dominant style is a horizontal drop or shiplap type the exterior siding should blend in not stand out  windows and doors the rhythm and arrangement of the windows and doors should reflect the style of the building design and the predominant patterns found in existing buildings of the area the ratio of the total surface area of openings to total wall surface area of new buildings should reflect that of historic buildings in the environs  details and other elements trim details are often the single most relevant design feature which can be utilized to give harmony and compatibility to a new building if existing buildings have boxed eaves do not leave rafter tails exposed if windows and doors typically have fanciful trim incorporate trim with architecturally equal weight if trim work is typically simple do not use ginger bread seek to design the new building so that the trim and architectural details compliment the existing buildings in the area  floor elevations the elevation of the first floor in relation to the street and the finish grade of the lot can often be a critical design feature for example if surrounding buildings normally have steps leading from street level up to the first floor level then the new building should have a similar entrance level note it is suggested that each design element outlined in this document be individually reviewed for more specific information  part 2005 development

character areas the dtmu district is comprised of three downtown character areas the boundaries of which are depicted on the regulating plandtmu district map the downtown character areas establish a framework for the scale of development that is desired in different locations within downtown main street mixeduse the purpose of the main street mixeduse character area is to provide opportunities for infill and redevelopment while retaining the traditional main street character and scale of carson street to support this objective building heights will be limited along the carson street frontage and adjacent to the state capitol complex and other historic structures but will be permitted to step up away from the streetproviding for a broader range of development opportunities active uses such as retail shops and restaurants as well as urban residential units are desired throughout the character area to promote a lively street environment and expanded hours of activity urban mixeduse the purpose of the urban mixeduse character area is to provide for urbanintensity mixeduse development in areas of downtown that contain larger tracts of vacant or underutilized land it is intended to provide opportunities for concentrations of active uses such as convention space casinos hotels urban residential or similar uses which typically have more intensive land requirements than could be readily accommodated in other areas of downtown to support these objectives building heights in this area are permitted to be higher than in other character areas within downtown provided appropriate transitions are provided to the more modest scale of development found along carson street the surrounding neighborhoods and the state capitol complex neighborhood transition the purpose of the neighborhood transition character area is to provide a more gradual transition between the more urban patterns of development desired in other locations within downtown and the surrounding residential neighborhoods to support this objective building heights are much more restrictive than in other character areas and are required to step down towards the surrounding neighborhood and building design becomes less blocky and urban and more residential in character uses in this area will tend to be primarily a mix of office and residential however a broad range of uses is permitted provided the design of the uses is compatible with the established character of the area  exh a part 2007 65  permitted uses this section sets forth the uses that are allowed within the dtmu district

historic district b to promote and establish appropriate procedures for the cleaning renovation and restoration of original downtown storefronts that have been substantially altered and obscured during previous remodeling efforts 2 inappropriate alterations a remodeling with unauthentic false historical details trims and moldings creates a confusing historical context for the community and should be avoided b the use of light gauge metal steel panels or other materials to make two or more storefronts appear to be a single larger structure should be avoided if panels are already in place upper story windows storefronts doors cornices and other trim materials which were removed to accommodate the panels should be researched and replaced during the rehabilitation process c upper story doors and windows and streetlevel storefronts that have been previously covered sealed or filled in should be restored to their original proportions and appearance during the rehabilitation process d transom windows which were covered over when suspended acoustical tiled ceilings were installed or for other reasons should be uncovered during the rehabilitation process 3 cleaning a abrasive cleaning techniques such as sandblasting should be avoided on the exterior of downtown buildings such cleaning methods cut into the buildings materials causing irreversible damage b sandblasted buildings that have not severely deteriorated should be painted to slow the process care must be taken to avoid varnishes enamels polyurethane sealants and other products impervious to moisture penetration sealants will lock moisture inside the masonry and prevent evaporation ultimately causing severe moisture damage c as an alternative to abrasive cleaning techniques the following techniques should be considered 1 a gentle water wash in combination with a natural bristle brush used to gently scrub the surface of the building if necessary a mild detergent can be used but must be thoroughly rinsed a for heavy grime or layers of paint a chemical cleaner may be necessary alkaline or acidic cleaners are available  however chemical cleaning should always be done by experienced professionals b a steam cleaning process may also be appropriate for certain building materials d whether water steam or chemical cleaner is used always clean a test patch area first to judge the reaction or consult a professional in the field a list of local professionals is available at the planning division e all debris and cleaning materials should be contained on site and not allowed to flow into the storm drain system 4 repair removal and replacement a removal of materials or structures including oversized signs windows or door coverings or metal slipcovers should not take place until the following steps are followed 1 inventory and photograph or draw accurate elevations of the elements to be removed  2 examine each element and determine how it is attached and anchored to the building if possible remove a small portion of a slipcover to determine how the rest is anchored  3 create a plan for repair of original material that was damaged when alterations were made  drilled holes for anchor bolts lost or damaged decorative elements accumulated dirt and rust stains are the most common types of damage b if a decorative element such as a cornice or trim around a window was removed or altered to accommodate earlier renovation efforts it may require replication by a skilled artisan or replacement with a simpler element catalogs of companies that specialize in replicating historic building architectural details are available from the planning division c if the original element is lost and no photo documentation is present it is recommended that the element be substituted with a more conservative design element d materials used to renovate existing buildings should be of a texture scale and color that are compatible with the original primary building material replacement parts should be selected so as to blend in with existing ones  rather than calling attention to themselves e native stone and masonry should be retained on existing buildings when possible f missing or damaged architectural features that are to be replaced should blend with the building fabric and duplicate the old or match it as closely as possible however these new materials should not be antiqued or made to look old when they are not g retention of original historic building elements is encouraged over replacement when replacement is required attention should be given to matching the buildings original window treatment as closely as possible  exh a part 2007 67  building envelope standards  exh a part 2007 68  building types  applicability building types desired

shall follow the sequence outlined below  program development this element establishes goals and objectives for development of the park facility who are the users how will the facility be integrated with the recreation activities anticipated what is the expected user experience what is the budget etc this element is developed in consultation with park staff  site analysis this element starts with inventory of onsite and offsite factors including both manmade elements and natural resources manmade elements include legal and physical boundary improvements such as buildings roads and utilities land uses etc natural resources include topography soil and geologic conditions water vegetation wildlife etc natural forces include temperature sand wind precipitation etc perceptual characteristics include views smells spatial patterns general impressions etc seek to identify the special nature of the site  this is also known as the opportunities and constraints phase  conceptual diagrams this element starts by grouping program items into logical associations so that their interdependence can be understood this element is generally referred to as the bubble diagram stage it concentrates on functional relationships and lines of travel without regard to scale or detailed site information next opportunities and constraints of the site are factored in so that uses can be located where they make the most sense  review after development of the site analysis and conceptual diagrams review by the park staff must be accomplished by the city prior to schematic design  schematic design once program relationships and onsite and offsite factors are understood the diagram is translated into a looselyscaled sketch the bubble diagrams should be viewed as just guidelines that can be freely manipulated to accommodate a great idea this is the stage where ideas flow freely in design charettes  all factors will be reacted to simultaneously as the concepts take shape it is important to develop several alternative designs for staff review  review presentation to the park and recreation commission for approval is held at this juncture to insure city input has been incorporated and selection in final design solution for the park facility  design development also referred to as the master plan this phase is characterized by a carefully rendered plan of the selected alternative usually accompanied by character sketches elevations and blowup plans of key areas it is important to have all elements scaled carefully at this phase so that there will be no surprises after the plans are reviewed and approved by the city usually there is an emphasis on graphic impact as the plans will be used for agency presentations andor public display a key component of this stage is a detailed cost estimate  this will be reviewed carefully by the city and will impact what facilities can be included in the park  review and approval the parks and recreation commission and the board will review the plans for final approval  construction documents these are the detailed plans and specifications for the park construction and will include various professional disciplines for a design such as the landscape architect civil engineer architect and electrical engineer these plans must be completed in the manner described in the landscape standards section of the appendix of this document park staff will review and approve the final construction documents before submitting to the carson city building department for a city building permit  bidding and construction depending on the type of facility project budget and scope of work the city will put the project out for formal competitive bids following the procedures required by the city  project close out at the completion of the project the city will require all construction documents to be provided to the city in electronic and hard copy format development standards 86  standard park components to allow for efficiency in maintenance and repair materials inventory training of personnel and recognizing the need of consistently attractive and durable products certain park facility products materials and elements are

adjacent to private property fencing should be used if requested by the adjacent property owner to deter users from leaving the trail several types of fencing could be used  for example 4smooth strand wire a wire mesh fence with wood corner postsmetal tee posts split rail wood fence or chain link fence and should be of a uniform nature for any given trail segment fencing should be selected in cooperation with the adjacent property owners  road crossings atgrade road crossings must be designed to equally consider vehicular and trail user safety reference figure 7 road crossings should be designed at road intersections and are preferred at these locations for safety reasons lf design constraints require a midblock road crossing a center refuge island with crosswalk striping should be considered to minimize pedestrianvehicle conflicts and user safety  sight distance clearing widths of shareduse trails involving bicycles and pedestrians should be designed to meet aashto standards to assure proper sight distance where possible if sight distances on curves around hills or vegetated areas are less than one hundred feet 100 safety signs and reduced speed limits should be considered at the intersections of shareduse trails or where offroad bicycle trails intersect with onroad bicycle routes not at road intersections there should ideally be a fifteen foot 15 turning radius and twentyfive foot 25 sight clearance between the two 2 trail routes  trail under crossings where a trail must pass under a highway bridge sufficient vertical clearspace and security lighting should be provided to accommodate trail use where practical the design should provide an optimum horizontal dimensions as called for by aashto standards where the provision of such spaces is not possible alternative pavement textures should be provided and safety signs placed on either side of the under crossing involved to inform trail users of such conditions and the procedures to follow such as reducing speeds or dismounting  trail structures 1 drainage crossings trails crossing creeks and drainages may require a culvert culverts in water courses or drainages must be carefully placed to minimize disturbance erosion control measures must be taken to prevent erosion at the outfalls of drainage structures the fill over culverts should match the trail and shoulder width 2 trail bridges

standards division 11  health 1  environmental health department requirements the environmental health department ehd regulates a number of areas related to development which includes septic system design  pretreatment program  industrial waste disposal program  solid waste management program  medical waste program development standards 112  septic system design  see nevada administrative nac sections  inclusive  the applicant shall submit plans to the building department for distribution to the ehd prior to the issuance of a septic permit the applicant shall meet all applicable state and city regulations applicant shall contact the environmental health department development standards 113  industrial waste disposal program the major focus of this program is to protect groundwater resources landfill personnel and the public by ensuring that no hazardous wastes are disposed at the landfill many industries generate a nonreusable byproduct that must be discarded this type of waste is often suitable for landfill disposal however a change in raw materials or processing techniques can render a hazardous waste due to this fact the ehd inspects and samples all potential sources of hazardous waste to determine if the waste is acceptable for disposal if the waste is not hazardous a manifest is issued to the industry allowing transport to the landfill the manifest system provides a tracking mechanism allowing a full accounting of industrial wastes accepted at the landfill if a hazardous waste is found the ehd coordinates with the nevada department of environmental protection ndep to ensure that is it properly transported and disposed at a certified hazardous waste disposal site development standards 114  solid waste management program carson city owns the landfill located east of the city the carson city sanitary landfill accepts municipal solid waste and constructiondemolition waste hazardous wastes are strictly prohibited the ehd tracks all asbestosrelated building demolitions and renovations from the time of building permit application to the ultimate disposal of the asbestos this is done to ensure that all asbestos abatement is performed in accordance with the federal regulations regarding removal transportation and disposal this protects the asbestos workers and the public from the health risks of asbestos exposure all asbestos is segregated from other municipal solid waste and immediately buried in an area which is surveyed in order to maintain a permanent record of its location development standards 115  medical waste program since 199 the ehd has enforced a medical waste program enforcement authority for this program is provided for in ccmc 1212 all facilities in carson city that generate a potentially infectious waste are required to properly containerize this waste in accordance with federal state and local regulations this waste must not be comingled with normal refuse the infectious waste is manifested then transported separately to the

enforcing a program to reduce pollutants generated from construction activities from entering the citys municipal storm water conveyance system this program includes the following  erosion & sediment control of ccmc the erosion and sediment control ordinance contains each of the following items  requires any person applying for a permit to develop and submit a erosion and sediment control plan with their permit application  requires any person who undertakes earth disturbance is subject to the ordinance  states permit requirements and action for failure to complete the work  states general erosion and sediment requirements and maintenance  states procedure for notification of needed maintenance enforcements and appeal process  program goals and objectives the erosion and sediment control program minimum requirements will be applied to construction activities that result in land disturbance of greater than or equal to one acre andor as required elsewhere in code reduction of storm water discharges from construction activity disturbing less than one acre will be included in the program if that construction activity is part of a larger common plan of development or sale that would disturb one acre or more the objective of this division is to provide guidance for avoiding adverse stormwater impacts from construction and other activities on downstream resources and onsite storm water facilities minimization of storm water flows prevention of soil erosion capture of waterborne sediment that has been unavoidably released from exposed soils and protection of water quality from onsite pollutant sources are all readily achievable when the proper best management practices bmps are planned installed and properly maintained the construction phase of a project is usually considered a temporary condition which will be supplanted by the permanent improvements and facilities for the completed project however construction work may take place over an extended period of time including several seasons over multiple years all management practices and control facilities used in the course of construction shall be of sufficient size strength and durability to readily outlast the longest possible construction schedule and the worst anticipated weather conditions the goal of a construction storm water pollution prevention plan is to avoid immediate and longterm environmental loss and degradation typically caused by poorly managed construction sites linear projects such as roadway construction and utility installations are special cases of construction activities and present their own unique set of stormwater protection challenges many of the bmps can be adapted and modified to provide the controls needed to adequately address these projects it may be advantageous to segment long linear projects into a series of separate units that can apply all necessary controls pertinent to that particular unit in a timely manner soil erosion and the resulting sedimentation produced by land develop impact the environment damage aquatic and recreational resources and create aesthetic problems examples of the impacts of erosion and sedimentation include  natural nutrient rich topsoils are eroded away making reestablishment of vegetation difficult consequently soil amendments and fertilizers must be applied a properly functioning soil system is a sustained storm water management mechanism vegetation and soil are not effectively sustained unless both are maintained in good condition  siltation fills culverts and storm drains decreasing capacities and increasing flooding and maintenance frequency  detention facilities fill rapidly with sediment decreasing storage capacity and increasing flooding  infiltration devices become clogged and fail  sediment in streams and rivers builds more rapidly resulting shallow areas become covered by aquatic plants reducing usability increased nutrient loading from phosphorus attached to soil particles and transported to streams can cause a change in the water ph algal blooms and oxygen depletion that leads to eutrophication and fish kills  treatment of water for domestic uses becomes more difficult and costly  aesthetically pleasing clear clean water is replaced with turbid water in streams and rivers  eroded soil particles decrease the viability of macroinvertebrates and foodchain organisms impair the feeding ability of aquatic animals clog gill passages of fish and reduce photosynthesis successful fish spawning is diminished by sedimentclogged gravel sedimentation following spawning can smother the eggs or young fry the carson city erosion and sediment control this division on erosion and sediment control follows the requirements instituted by the us environmental protection agency for owneroperators of private and public construction sites under the phase ii national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes program all construction site

standards 133  construction stormwater pollution prevention plan swppp there are three basic steps in producing an erosion and sediment control plan or construction swppp this section outlines and describes a recommended stepbystep procedure for developing a construction swppp from data collection to finished product this procedure is written in general terms to be applicable to all types of projects the construction swppp is a document that describes the potential for pollution problems on a construction project the construction swppp also explains and illustrates the measures to be taken on the construction site to control those problems while it is a good idea to include standards and specifications from the construction swppp in the contract documents the construction swppp should be a separate document that can standalone the construction swppp must be located on the construction site or within reasonable access to the site for construction and inspection personnel although a copy of the drawings must be kept on the construction site at all times division 134 includes a checklist for developing a construction swppp the construction swppp may be a subset of the technical drainage study improvement plan or construction plan set as site work progresses the plan must be modified to reflect changing site conditions the owner or lessee of the land being developed has the responsibility for construction swppp preparation the owner or lessee may designate someone ie an engineer architect contractor etc to prepare the construction swppp but heshe retains the ultimate responsibility  what is an adequate plan the construction swppp must contain sufficient information to satisfy the public works department development engineering that the problems of pollution have been adequately addressed for the proposed project an adequate construction swppp includes a narrative and drawings the narrative is a written statement to explain and justify the pollution prevention decisions made for a particular project the narrative contains concise information about existing site conditions construction schedules and other pertinent items that are not contained on the drawings the drawings and notes describe where and when the various bmps should be installed the performance the bmps are expected to achieve and actions to be taken if the performance goals are not achieved on construction sites that discharge to surface water the primary concern in the preparation of the construction swppp is compliance with nevada water quality standards each of the 12 elements must be included in the construction swppp unless an element is determined not to be applicable to the project and the exemption is justified in the narrative the stepbystep procedure outlined in this section is recommended for the development of the construction swppps the checklists presented in this section may be helpful in preparing and reviewing the construction swppp on construction sites that infiltrate all stormwater runoff the primary concern in the preparation of the construction swppp is the protection of the infiltration facilities from fine sediments during the construction phase and protection of ground water from other pollutants several of the other elements are very important at these sites as well such as marking the clearing limits establishing the construction access and managing the project  bmp standards and specifications division 135 contains references for standards and specifications for the bmps referred to in this division wherever any of these bmps are to be employed on a site the specific title and number of the bmp should be clearly referenced in the narrative and marked on the drawings the standards and specifications in division 135 of this division are not intended to limit any innovative or creative effort to effectively control erosion and sedimentation in those instances where appropriate bmps are not in this division experimental management practices can be considered minor modifications to standard practices may also be employed however such practices must be approved by the city engineer before they may be used all experimental management practices and modified standard practices are required to achieve the same or better performance than the bmps listed in division 135  general principles the following general principals should be applied to the development of the construction swppp  the native topsoil and natural vegetation should be retained in an undisturbed state to the maximum extent practicable  prevent pollutant release select source control bmps as a first line of defense prevent erosion rather than treat turbid runoff  select bmps depending on site characteristics topography drainage soil type ground cover and critical areas and the construction plan  divert runoff away from exposed areas wherever possible keep clean water clean  limit the extent of clearing operations and phase construction operations  before reseeding a disturbed soil area amend all soils with compost wherever topsoil has been removed  incorporate natural drainage features whenever possible using adequate buffers and protecting areas where flow enters the drainage system  minimize slope length and steepness  reduce runoff velocities to prevent channel erosion  prevent the tracking of sediment offsite  select appropriate bmps for the control of pollutants other than sediment  be realistic about the limitations of control that you specify and the operation and maintenance of those controls anticipate what can go wrong how you can prevent it from happening and what will need to be done to fix it  stepbystep procedure the development of the construction swppp includes the following three steps step 1  data collection step 2  data analysis step 3  construction swppp development and implementation a step 1  data collection evaluate existing site conditions and gather information that will help develop the most effective construction swppp the information gathered should be explained in the narrative and shown on the drawings topography prepare a topographic drawing of the site to show the existing contour elevations at intervals of 1 to 5 feet depending upon the slope of the terrain drainage locate and clearly mark existing drainage swales and patterns on the drawing including existing storm drainpipe systems soils identify and label soil types and erodibility low medium high or an index value from the nrcs manual on the drawing soils information can be obtained from the soil survey of carson city area nevada soils can be characterized for permeability percent organic matter and effective depth these qualities can be expressed in averaged or nominal terms for most areas of carson city the information found in the soil survey lists the following information for each soil mapping unit or designation  a sieve analysis of the soils  permeability inhr  available waterholding capacity inin  the percent of organic matter ground cover label existing vegetation on the drawing such features as tree clusters grassy areas and unique or sensitive vegetation should be shown unique vegetation may include existing trees above a given diameter in addition existing denuded or exposed soil areas should be indicated critical areas delineate critical areas adjacent to or within the site on the drawing such features as steep slopes streams floodplains wetlands and geologic hazard areas etc should be shown delineate set backs and buffer limits for these features on the drawings other related jurisdictional boundaries such as the federal emergency management agency fema base floodplain should also be shown on the drawings adjacent areas identify existing buildings roads and facilities adjacent to or within the project site on the drawings identify existing and proposed utility locations construction clearing limits and erosion and sediment control bmps on the drawings existing encumbrances identify wells existing and abandoned septic drainfields utilities and site constraints precipitation records determine the average monthly rainfall and rainfall intensity for the required design storm events based on information available in the noaa atlas b step 2  data analysis consider the data collected in step 1 to visualize potential problems and limitations of the site determine those areas that have critical erosion hazards the following are some important factors to consider in data analysis topography the primary topographic considerations are slope steepness and slope length because of the effect of runoff the longer and steeper the slope the greater the erosion potential erosion potential should be determined by a qualified engineer soil professional certified erosion control specialist or other qualified person drainage natural drainage patterns that consist of overland flow swales and depressions should be used to convey runoff site to avoid constructing an artificial drainage system manmade ditches and waterways will become part of the erosion problem if they are not properly stabilized care should also be taken to ensure that increased runoff from the site will not erode or flood the existing natural drainage system possible sites for temporary stormwater retention and detention should be considered at this point direct construction away from areas of saturated soilareas where ground water may be encounteredand critical areas where drainage will concentrate preserve natural drainage patterns on the site soils evaluate soil properties such as surface and subsurface runoff characteristics depth to impermeable layer depth to seasonal ground water table permeability shrinkswell potential texture settleability and erodibility develop the construction swppp based on known soil characteristics infiltration sites should be properly protected from silt which will reduce infiltration capacities ground cover ground cover is the most important factor in terms of preventing erosion existing vegetation that can be saved will prevent erosion better than constructed bmps trees and other vegetation protect the soil structure if the existing vegetation cannot be saved consider such practices as phasing construction temporary seeding and mulching phasing of construction involves stabilizing one part of the site before disturbing another in this way the entire site is not disturbed at once critical areas critical areas may include flood hazard areas mine hazard areas slide hazard areas sole source aquifers wetlands stream banks fishbearing streams and other water bodies any critical areas within or adjacent to the development should exert a strong influence on land development decisions critical areas and their buffers shall be delineated on the drawings and clearly flagged in the field chain link fencing may be more useful than flagging to assure that equipment operators stay out of critical areas only unavoidable work should take place within critical areas and their buffers such unavoidable work will require special bmps permit restrictions and mitigation plans adjacent areas an analysis of adjacent properties should focus on areas upslope and down slope from the construction project water bodies that will receive direct runoff from the site are a major concern the types values and sensitivities of and risks to downstream resources such as private property stormwater facilities public infrastructure or aquatic systems should be evaluated erosion and sediment controls should be selected accordingly timing of the project an important consideration in selecting bmps is the timing and duration of the project projects that will last seasons must take all necessary precautions to remain in compliance with the water quality standards c step 3  construction swppp development and implementation after collecting and analyzing the data to determine the site limitations the planner can then develop a construction swppp each of the 12 minimum requirements must be considered and included in the construction swppp unless site conditions render the minimum requirement unnecessary and the exemption from that element is clearly justified in the narrative of the swppp the 12

following bmps can be used on construction sites to reduce or prevent erosion reduce or prevent the release of sediments to offsite areas and to prevention storm water pollution the bmps are grouped according to the main categories of erosion control bmps sediment control bmps management source control bmps the purpose of this compilation of bmps is to provide general guidance for selecting and implementing bmps that will eliminate or reduce the discharge of pollutants from construction sites many state federal and local agencies and nongovernmental groups have developed construction site

stormwater bmp handbook construction 2003 bmps for erosion and sediment control must be selected to meet the bmp objectives based on sitespecific conditions construction activities and cost the goal of construction bmps is to minimize the disturbed areas stabilize disturbed areas and protect slopes and channels from erosion several considerations for selecting bmps for contractor activities include is it expected to rain selection of a bmp is different for the rainy season versus the dry season consider rescheduling activities until after the rains or perform in dry season how much water is being used for construction activities the more water used the more likely that pollutants transported by this water will reach the drainage system or be transported offsite what are the site conditions bmps may differ depending on whether the activity is conducted on a slope or flat ground near a drainage structure or watercourse conducting activities away from certain sensitive areas will reduce the cost and inconvenience of implementing bmps what about accidents controls for common activities should be established and preparations should be made to allow for quick response to accidents or spills in the event of a spill or exposure of construction compounds what are the contingency plans for sampling the contaminated stormwater can the analysis be done in the field or should laboratory analysis be required are sample bottles available onsite appropriated test strips etc  bmp monitoring all construction site bmps must be monitored on a regular basis to ensure that the bmp is functioning as designed the monitoring consists of visual inspection to determine whether the bmp was implemented and maintained according to the swppp site inspections can include a contractor activity bmps  looking for evidence of spills and resulting cleanup procedures eg supplies of spill cleanup materials  verifying adequacy of trash receptacles  verifying waste disposal practices eg recycle vs hazardous waste bins  examining integrity and use of containment structures  verifying use of employees education programs for the various activities  noting the location of activity eg outdoor vs indoor concrete vs grass  bmps for any chemicals or fuels not addressed in the swppp must be developed b erosion and sediment control bmps  are erosion and sediment control bmps installed properly the swppp bmps should include details or references to allow for the proper construction of structural or vegetative erosion and sediment control devices the inspector should ensure that these systems are installed according to the swppp in the proper locations  are the bmps effective the effectiveness of the bmp would be based on the presence of sediment behind or within control devices the presence of sediment downstream of the site and signs of erosion in stabilized areas after a storm event  have drainage patterns changed if the site has undergone significant grading operations resulting in a change of drainage patterns adjustment to the bmps will likely be required to address this change the inspectors shall determine the extent of changes to the drainage pattern and the necessity for additional or reconfigured bmps  are areas stabilized as quickly as possible after completion of construction activities in an area disturbed active and inactive construction areas inactive construction areas may be defined as areas in which no construction activity will occur for a period of 30 days or longer should be stabilized as soon as practical if construction climatological or other site conditions do not allow stabilization the swppp should define alternative approaches  are the bmps properly maintained maintenance of erosion and sediment control bmps is critical erosion controls should be installed as soon as practical after an area becomes inactive and before the onset of rain the capacity of sediment controls must be restored prior to the next rain event  bmp maintenance the construction site should be inspected on a regular basis and during and after any storm generating runoff to determine maintenance requirements and general condition of the installed system all maintenance related to a storm event should be completed within 48 hours of the storm event the following maintenance tasks should be performed on a regular basis  removal of sediment from barriers and sedimentation devices  replacement or repair of worn or damaged silt fence fabrics  replacement or repair of damaged structural controls  repair of damaged soil stabilization measures  other control maintenance as defined in each bmp fact sheet  erosion and sediment control bmps table 2 lists the bmps contained in this division that are primarily installed to prevent or minimize erosion on the construction site by protecting the soil surface and preventing soil particles from being detached by rainfall flowing water or wind in addition several of the

the grading season is determined by the local climate conditions all grading clearing and excavation work should be conducted during this period in order to avoid climatic conditions that could increase the chances for erosion purpose to coordinate grading and construction activities such that bare and disturbed soil exposure is minimized during the winter snow windy and rainy seasons applicability for construction or development projects in locations where there is an opportunity for snow or rain to occur to the extent that soils become saturated and surface soil erosion is possible planning criteria many counties and communities have established specific grading and construction seasons applicable to their local environment coordination with the local building department or public works department will clarify any regulatory requirements applicable to the development project methods and materials the best time to begin construction is after the snow has melted all grading and excavation work should be completed prior to setting in of winter at that time all building sites should be winterized grading should not take place during storm events rain or snow and for the following period of time when the site is covered with snow or the soil is in a wet saturated muddy or unstable condition 2 bmp ec2 preserving natural vegetation purpose the purpose of preserving natural vegetation is to reduce erosion wherever practicable limiting site disturbance is the single most effective method for reducing erosion carefully planned preservation of existing trees vines shrubs and grasses can protect soil from erosion conditions of use  preservation of existing vegetation is suitable for use on most projects  natural vegetation should be preserved on steep slopes near perennial and intermittent watercourses or swales and on building sites in wooded areas  areas where carson city or state regulations require preservation eg wetland buffers environmentally sensitive areas design and installation specifications natural vegetation can be preserved in natural clumps or as individual trees shrubs and vines the preservation of individual plants is more difficult because heavy equipment is generally used to remove unwanted vegetation the points to remember when attempting to save individual plants are  is the plant worth saving consider the location species size age vigor and the work involved local governments may also have ordinances to save natural vegetation and trees  fence or clearly mark areas around trees that are to be saved it is preferable to keep ground disturbance away from the trees at least as far out as the drip line plants need protection from three kinds of injuries  construction equipment  this injury can be above or below the ground level damage results from scarring cutting of roots and compaction of the soil placing a fenced buffer zone around plants to be saved prior to construction can prevent construction equipment injuries  grade changes  changing the natural ground level will alter grades which affects the plants ability to obtain the necessary air water and minerals minor fills usually do not cause problems although sensitivity between species does vary and should be checked trees can tolerate fill of 6 inches or less for shrubs and other plants the fill should be less when there are major changes in grade it may become necessary to supply air to the roots of plants this can be done by placing a layer of gravel and a tile system over the roots before the fill is made a tile system protects a tree from a raised grade the tile system should be laid out on the original grade leading from a dry well around the tree trunk the system should then be covered with small stones to allow air to circulate over the root area lowering the natural ground level can seriously damage trees and shrubs the highest percentage of the plant roots are in the upper 12 inches of the soil and cuts of only 23 inches can cause serious injury to protect the roots it may be necessary to terrace the immediate area around the plants to be saved if roots are exposed construction of retaining walls may be needed to keep the soil in place plants can also be preserved by leaving them on an undisturbed gently sloping mound to increase the chances for survival it is best to limit grade changes and other soil disturbances to areas outside the drip line of the plant  excavations  protect trees and other plants when excavating for drain fields power water and sewer lines where possible the trenches should be routed around trees and large shrubs when this is not possible it is best to tunnel under them this can be done with hand tools or with power augers if it is not possible to route the trench around plants to be saved then the following should be observed  cut as few roots as possible when you have to cut cut clean  paint cut root ends with a wood dressing like asphalt base paint  backfill the trench as soon as possible  tunnel beneath root systems as close to the center of the main trunk to preserve most of the important feeder roots maintenance standards during construction the limits of disturbance should remain clearly marked at all times irrigation or maintenance of existing vegetation should be described in the landscaping plan if damage to protected trees still occurs maintenance guidelines described below should be followed  verify that protective measure remain in place restore damaged protection measures immediately  serious tree injuries shall be attended to by an arborist  damage to the crown trunk or root system of a retained tree shall be repaired immediately  if bark damage occurs cut back all loosened bark into the undamaged area with the cut tapered at the top and bottom and drainage provided at the base of the wood limit cutting the undamaged area as much as possible  serrate soil that has been compacted over a trees root zone by punching holes 12 inches deep with an iron bar and moving the bar back and forth until the soil is loosened place holes 18 inches apart throughout the area of compacted soil under the tree crown  retain protective measures until all other construction activity is complete to avoid damage during site cleanup and stabilization 3 bmp ec3 buffer zones purpose an undisturbed area or strip of natural vegetation or an established suitable planting that will provide a living filter to reduce soil erosion and runoff velocities conditions of use natural buffer zones are used along streams wetlands and other bodies of water that need protection from erosion and sedimentation vegetative buffer zones can be used to protect natural swales and can be incorporated into the natural landscaping of an area criticalareas buffer zones should not be used as sediment treatment areas these areas shall remain completely undisturbed design and installation specifications preserving natural vegetation or plantings in clumps blocks or strips is generally the easiest and most successful method  leave all unstable steep slopes in natural vegetation  mark clearing limits and keep all equipment and construction debris out of the natural areas steel construction fencing is the most effective method in protecting sensitive areas and buffers  alternatively wirebacked silt fence on steel posts is marginally effective flagging alone is typically not effective  keep all excavations outside the drip line of trees and shrubs  do not push debris or extra soil into the buffer zone area because it will cause damage from burying and smothering  vegetative buffer zones for streams or other waterways shall be established by the local permitting authority or other state or federal permits or approvals maintenance standards  inspect the area frequently to make sure flagging remains in place and the area remains undisturbed 4 bmp ec4 high visibility plastic or metal fence purpose fencing is intended to 1 restrict clearing to approved limits  2 prevent disturbance of sensitive areas their buffers and other areas required to be left undisturbed  3 limit construction traffic to designated construction entrances or roads  and 4 protect areas where marking with survey tape may not provide adequate protection conditions of use to establish clearing limits plastic or metal fence may be used  at the boundary of sensitive areas their buffers and other areas required to be left uncleared  as necessary to control vehicle access to and on the site design and installation

to provide needed access to an area should be constructed in such a way that the quality of runoff water is preserved purpose to provide a route for vehicle travel for moving equipment supplies and products and for providing access for proper operation and management of conservation enterprises without disturbing the quality of runoff water applicability where roads are needed to provide access from a county state or federal highway or to provide planned travelways within an area planning criteria 1 location roads should be located to serve the purpose intended and to facilitate the control and disposal of surface water 2 gradient vertical and horizontal alignment the gradient and alignment should be adapted to the development of which it is a part 3 width the recommended minimum width of the roadbed is 14 feet for oneway traffic and 20 feet for twoway traffic the tread width for twoway traffic should be increased approximately 5feet for trailer traffic the recommended minimum shoulder width is 2feet on each side of the tread width widths less than recommended minimums may be used where topography or other natural conditions restrict the width 4 side slopes all cuts and fills should have side slopes that are stable for the soil or soil material involved typically side slopes should not be steeper than  50% slope 5 drainage culverts bridges or grade dips should be provided at all natural drainageways design of these structures should be conducted by a qualified engineer in keeping with sound engineering practices for the class of vehicle or equipment used on the road roadside ditches should be adequate to provide surface drainage for the roadway and deep enough to serve as outlets for subsurface drainage 6 erosion control measures erosion control measures should be provided for roads ditches cut slopes fill slopes and cross drains 7 surfacing access roads should be given a wearing course or surface treatment when required for traffic needs climate erosion control or dust control the type of treatment will depend on local conditions available materials and the existing road base where these factors and the volume of traffic are not a problem no special treatment of the surface is required sound engineering practices must be followed to ensure that the road will meet the requirements of its intended use 8 intersection with public highways traffic safety should be a prime factor in selecting the angle of intersection with public highways any access roads that connect to a state highway must be approved by the state highway department maintenance roadways drainage structures and erosion control facilities must be maintained on an as needed basis given the site specifics of the access road to keep them operational proper and regular maintenance will minimize soil erosion and the degradation of surface and ground water resources effectiveness proper installation and maintenance of access roads can be effective in reducing soil erosion and minimizing impacts to water quality 6 bmp ec6 construction roadparking area stabilization purpose stabilizing subdivision roads parking areas and other onsite vehicle transportation routes immediately after grading reduces erosion caused by construction traffic or runoff conditions of use  roads or parking areas whether permanent or temporary shall be stabilized wherever they are constructed for use by construction traffic  fencing see bmps ec4 shall be installed if necessary to limit the access of vehicles to only those roads and parking areas that are stabilized design and installation specifications  construct on level ground where possible  on areas that will receive asphalt as part of the project install the first lift as soon as possible  a 6inch depth of 2 to 4inch crushed rock gravel base or crushed surfacing base course shall be applied immediately after grading or utility installation a 4inch course of asphalt treated base atb may also be used or the roadparking area may be paved it may also be possible to use cement or calcium chloride for soil stabilization if cement or cement kiln dust is used for road base stabilization ph monitoring and bmps are necessary to evaluate and minimize the effects on stormwater if the area will not be used for permanent roads parking areas or structures a 6inch depth of hog fuel may also be used but this is likely to require more maintenance whenever possible construction roads and parking areas shall be placed on a firm compacted subgrade  temporary road gradients shall not exceed 15% roadways shall be carefully graded to drain drainage ditches shall be provided on each side of the roadway in the case of a crowned section or on one side in the case of a superelevated section drainage ditches shall be directed to a sediment control bmp  rather than relying on ditches it may also be possible to grade the road so that runoff sheetflows into a heavily vegetated area with welldeveloped topsoil landscaped areas are not adequate if this area has at least 50 feet of vegetation then it is generally preferable to use the vegetation to treat runoff rather than a sediment pond or trap the 50 feet shall not include wetlands if runoff is allowed to sheet flow vegetated areas it is vital to design the roadways and parking areas so that no concentrated runoff is created  storm drain inlets shall be protected to prevent sedimentladen water entering the storm drain system see bmp sc4 maintenance standards  inspect stabilized areas regularly especially after large storm events  crushed rock gravel base hog fuel etc shall be added as required to maintain a stable driving surface and to stabilize any areas that have eroded  following construction these areas shall be restored to preconstruction condition or better to prevent future erosion 7 bmp ec7 dust and wind erosion control purpose dust control prevents wind transport of dust from disturbed soil surfaces onto roadways drainage ways and surface waters wind erosion or dust control consists of applying water or other dust palliatives as necessary to prevent or alleviate dust nuisance generated by construction activities covering small stockpiles or areas is an alternative to applying water or other dust palliatives conditions of use in areas including roadways subject to surface and air movement of dust where onsite and offsite impacts to roadways drainage ways or surface waters are likely wind erosion control bmps are suitable during the following construction activities  construction vehicle traffic on unpaved roads  drilling and blasting activities  sediment tracking onto paved roads  soils and debris storage piles  batch drop from frontend loaders  areas with unstabilized soil  final gradingsite stabilization limitations  water prevents dust only for a short period and should be applied daily or more often to be effective  over watering may cause erosion  oil or oiltreated subgrade should not be used for dust control because the oil may migrate into drainage ways andor seep into the soil  effectiveness depends on soil temperature humidity and wind velocity  chemically treated subgrades may make the soil water repellant interfering with longterm infiltration and the vegetationrevegetation of the site some chemical dust suppressants may be subject to freezing may contain solvents and should be handled properly  asphalt as a mulch tack or chemical mulch requires a 24hour curing time to avoid adherence to equipment worker shoes etc application should be limited because asphalt surfacing may eventually migrate into the drainage system  in compacted areas watering and other liquid dust control measures may wash sediment or other constituents into the drainage system planning criteria 1 plan and schedule work to open the least amount of land possible at one time surface disturbances should be stabilized or reclaimed before additional land is disturbed 2 install permanent erosion control measures as soon as construction or development work is completed 3 the irrigation water supply should be developed before land is opened so that water is available for establishing vegetation 4 when possible schedule construction and development operations during months with the least wind erosion hazard this is usually during later summer design and installation specifications  vegetate or mulch areas that will not receive vehicle traffic in areas where planting mulching or paving is impractical apply gravel or landscaping rock  limit dust generation by clearing only those areas where immediate activity will take place leaving the remaining areas in the original condition if stable maintain the original ground cover as long as practical  construct natural or artificial windbreaks or windscreens these may be designed as enclosures for small dust sources  sprinkle the site with water until surface is wet repeat as needed to prevent carryout of mud onto street refer to stabilized construction entrance bmp sc1  irrigation water can be used for dust control irrigation systems should be installed as a first step on sites where dust control is a concern  spray exposed soil areas with a dust palliative following the manufacturers instructions and cautions regarding handling and application used oil is prohibited from use as a dust suppressant local governments may approve other dust palliatives such as calcium chloride or pam  pam bmp ec19 added to water at a rate of 05 lbs per 1000 gallons of water per acre and applied from a water truck is more effective than water alone this is due to the increased infiltration of water into the soil and reduced evaporation in addition small soil particles are bonded together and are not as easily transported by wind  adding pam may actually reduce the quantity of water needed for dust control since the wholesale cost of pam is about $ 400 per pound this is an extremely cost effective dust control method  dust control bmps generally stabilize exposed surfaces and minimize activities that suspend or track dust particles the following table shows dust control practices that can be

treatments  pave unpaved permanent roads and other trafficked areas  use vacuum street sweepers  remove mud and other dirt promptly so it does not dry and then turn into dust  limit dustcausing work on windy days  contact your local air pollution control authority for guidance and training on other dust control measures compliance with the local air pollution control authority constitutes compliance with this bmp additional preventive measures include  schedule construction activities to minimize exposed area  limit onsite vehicle traffic to 15 mph  control the number and activity of vehicles on a site at any given time  identify and stabilize key access points prior to commencement of construction  minimize the impact of dust by anticipating the direction of prevailing winds  direct most construction traffic to stabilized roadways within the project site  water should be applied by means of pressuretype distributors or pipelines equipped with a spray system or hoses and nozzles that will ensure even distribution  all distribution equipment should be equipped with a positive means of shutoff  unless water is applied by means of pipelines at least one mobile unit should be available at all times to apply water or dust palliative to the project  if reclaimed wastewater is used nonpotable water should not be conveyed in tanks or drainpipes that will be used to convey potable water and there should be no connection between potable and nonpotable supplies  materials applied as temporary soil stabilizers and soil binders also generally provide wind erosion control benefits  pave or chemically stabilize access points where unpaved traffic surfaces adjoin paved roads  provide covers for haul trucks transporting materials that contribute to dust  provide for wet suppression or chemical stabilization of exposed soils  provide for rapid clean up of sediments deposited on paved roads furnish stabilized construction road entrances and vehicle wash down areas  stabilize inactive construction sites using vegetation or chemical stabilization methods inspection and maintenance  inspect and verify that activitybased bmps are in place prior to the commencement of associated activities while activities associated with the bmp are under way inspect weekly during the rainy season and at twoweek intervals in the nonrainy season to verify continued bmp implementation  regular maintenance is critical to effective dust control whether temporary or permanent measures are being utilized most dust control measures require frequent often daily or multiple times per day attention  regular water applications are necessary given specific site conditions mulches should be replaced or reapplied as necessary  vegetative cover should be established and maintained on surface disturbance areas check areas protected to ensure coverage  keep windbreak and barriers in good conditions by repairing or replanting any openings  protect sensitive areas from additional surface disturbances effectiveness dust control will reduce sediment delivery by runoff waters control degradation of water in nearby streams from windblown sediments and minimize the loss of topsoil 8 bmp ec8 level spreader purpose to convert concentrated flows into sheet flow for surface application at nonerosive velocities onto stabilized areas to provide a temporary outlet for dikes and diversions consisting of an excavated depression constructed at zero grade across a slope conditions of use  used when a concentrated flow of water needs to be dispersed over a large area with existing stable vegetation  items to consider are 1 what is the risk of erosion or damage if the flow may become concentrated 2 is an easement required if discharged to adjoining property 3 most of the flow should be as ground water and not as surface flow 4 is there an unstable area downstream that cannot accept additional ground water  use only where the slopes are gentle the water volume is relatively low and the soil will adsorb most of the low flow events planning criteria detailed design is not required but extreme care must be used during construction to ensure that the outlet lip is exactly level and uniform from end to end failure to meet these requirements will cause concentrated flow and consequent erosion of the stabilized area the excavation for the spreader should be on wellstabilized soils vegetated or rock armored determine mapping the length and degree of slope contributing watershed and associated drainage ways baseline soils data should be gathered and analyzed for erodability design and installation specifications  use above undisturbed areas that are stabilized by existing vegetation  runoff to the spreader should be from areas that have been stabilized to eliminate sediment buildup in the spreader  if the level spreader has any low points flow will concentrate create channels and may cause erosion  discharge area below the outlet must be uniform with a slope of less than 5h 1v  outlet to be constructed level in a stable undisturbed soil profile not on fill  the runoff shall not concentrate after release unless intercepted by another downstream measure  the grade of the channel for the last 20 feet of the dike or interceptor entering the level spreader shall be less than or equal to 1% the grade of the level spreader shall be 0% to ensure uniform spreading of storm runoff  a 6inch high gravel berm placed across the level lip shall consist of washed crushed rock 2 to 4inch or 34inch to 112inch size  the spreader length shall be determined by estimating the peak flow expected from the 10year 24hour design storm the length of the spreader shall be a minimum of 15 feet for 01 cfs and shall be 10 feet for each 01 cfs there after to a maximum of 05 cfs per spreader use multiple spreaders for higher flows  the width of the spreader should be at least 6 feet  the depth of the spreader as measured from the lip should be at least 6 inches and it should be uniform across the entire length  level spreaders shall be setback from the property line unless there is an easement for flow  level spreaders when installed every so often in grassy swales keep the flows from concentrating materials that can be used include sand bags lumber logs concrete and pipe to function properly the material needs to be installed level and on contour maintenance standards  the spreader should be inspected and repaired as necessary after every runoff event to ensure that it is functioning correctly  remove sediment as necessary  the contractor should avoid the placement of any material on the structure and should prevent construction traffic from crossing over the structure  if the spreader is damaged by construction traffic it shall be immediately repaired figure ec81 cross level spreader from stormwater management manual for western washington washington department of ecology 2001 figure ec82 detail of level spreader from stormwater management manual for western washington washington department of ecology 2001 9 bmp ec9 subsurface drains purpose to intercept collect and convey ground water to a satisfactory outlet using a perforated pipe or conduit below the ground surface subsurface drains are also known as french drains the perforated pipe provides a dewatering mechanism to drain excessively wet soils provides a stable base for construction improves stability of structures with shallow foundations and reduces hydrostatic pressure to improve slope stability conditions of use use when excessive water must be removed from the soil the soil permeability depth to water table and impervious layers are all factors which may govern the use of subsurface drains design and installation specifications  relief drains are used either to lower the water table in large relatively flat areas improve the growth of vegetation or to remove surface water they are installed along a slope and drain in the direction of the slope they can be installed in a grid pattern a herringbone pattern or a random pattern  interceptor drains are used to remove excess ground water from a slope stabilize steep slopes and lower the water table immediately below a slope to prevent the soil from becoming saturated they are installed perpendicular to a slope and drain to the side of the slope they usually consist of a single pipe or series of single pipes instead of a patterned layout  depth and spacing of interceptor drains  the depth of an interceptor drain is determined primarily by the depth to which the water table is to be lowered or the depth to a confining layer for practical reasons the maximum depth is usually limited to 6 feet with a minimum cover of 2 feet to protect the conduit  the soil should have depth and sufficient permeability to permit installation of an effective drainage system at a depth of 2 to 6 feet  an adequate outlet for the drainage system must be available either by gravity or by pumping  the quantity and quality of discharge needs to be accounted for in the receiving stream additional detention may be required  this standard does not apply to subsurface drains for building foundations or deep excavations  the capacity of an interceptor drain is determined by calculating the maximum rate of ground water flow to be intercepted therefore it is good practice to make complete subsurface investigations including hydraulic conductivity of the soil before designing a subsurface drainage system  size of drain  size subsurface drains to carry the required capacity without pressure flow minimum diameter for a subsurface drain is 4 inches  the minimum velocity required to prevent silting is 14 feet sec the line shall be graded to achieve this velocity at a minimum the maximum allowable velocity using a sandgravel filter or envelope is 9 feet sec filter material and fabric shall be used around all drains for proper bedding and filtration of fine materials envelopes and filters should surround the drain to a minimum of 3inch thickness  the outlet of the subsurface drain shall empty into a sediment pond catch basin if free of sediment it can then empty into a receiving channel swale or stable vegetated area adequately protected from erosion and undermining  the trench shall be constructed on a continuous grade with no reverse grades or low spots  soft or yielding soils under the drain shall be stabilized with gravel or other suitable material  backfilling shall be done immediately after placement of the pipe no sections of pipe shall remain uncovered overnight or during a rainstorm backfill material shall be placed in the trench in such a manner that the drainpipe is not displaced or damaged  do not install permanent drains near trees to avoid the tree roots that tend to clog the line use solid pipe with watertight connections where it is necessary to pass a subsurface drainage system stand of trees  outlet  ensure that the outlet of a drain empties into a channel or other watercourse above the normal water level  secure an animal guard to the outlet end of the pipe to keep out rodents  use outlet pipe of corrugated metal cast iron or heavyduty plastic without perforations and at least 10 feet long do not use an envelope or filter material around the outlet pipe and bury at least twothirds of the pipe length  when outlet velocities exceed those allowable for the receiving stream outlet protection must be provided maintenance standards  subsurface drains shall be checked periodically to ensure that they are freeflowing and not clogged with sediment or roots  the outlet shall be kept clean and free of debris  surface inlets shall be kept open and free of sediment and other debris  trees located too close to a subsurface drain often clog the system with their roots if a drain becomes clogged relocate the drain or remove the trees as a last resort drain placement should be planned to minimize this problem  where drains are crossed by heavy vehicles the line shall be checked to ensure that it is not crushed 10 bmp ec10 pipe slope drains purpose a slope drain is a pipe used to intercept and direct surface runoff or groundwater into a stabilized watercourse trapping device or stabilized area slope drains are used with earth dikes and drainage ditches to intercept and direct surface flow away from slope areas to protect cut or fill slopes conditions of use  pipe slope drains should be used when a temporary or permanent stormwater conveyance is needed to move the water down a steep slope to avoid erosion  drainage for top of slope diversion dikes or swales  drainage for top of cut and fill slopes where water can accumulate  emergency spillway for a sediment basin  collect clean runoff from plastic sheeting and direct it away from exposed soil  installed in conjunction with silt fence to drain collected water to a controlled area  used to divert small seasonal streams away from construction they have been used successfully on culvert replacement and extension jobs large flex pipe can be used on larger streams during culvert removal repair or replacement  connected to existing down spouts and roof drains and used to divert water away from work areas during building renovation demolition and construction projects there are several commercially available collectors that are attached to the pipe inlet and help prevent erosion at the inlet design and installation specifications  permanent structures included in the project plans can often serve as construction bmps if implemented early however the permanent structure must meet or exceed the criteria for the temporary structure  size the pipe to convey the flow the capacity for temporary drains shall be sufficient to handle the peak flow from a 10year 24hour storm event permanent pipe slope drains shall be sized for the 25year 24hour peak flow  use care in clearing vegetated slopes for installation  reestablish cover immediately on areas disturbed by installation  use temporary drains on new cut or fill slopes  use diversion dikes or swales to collect water at the top of the slope  install slope drains perpendicular to slope contours  ensure that the entrance area is stable and large enough to direct flow into the pipe  the entrance shall consist of a standard flared end section for culverts 12 inches and larger with a minimum 6inch metal toe plate to prevent runoff from undercutting the pipe inlet the slope of the entrance shall be at least 3% sand bags may also be used at pipe entrances as a temporary measure  debris racks are recommended at the inlet debris racks located several feet upstream of the inlet can usually be larger than racks at the inlet and thus provide enhanced debris protection and less plugging  safety racks are recommended at the inlet and outlet of pipes where children or animals could become trapped  the soil around and under the pipe and entrance section shall be thoroughly compacted to prevent undercutting and gully erosion  the flared inlet section shall be securely connected to the slope drain and have watertight connecting bands  slope drain sections shall be securely fastened together fused or have gasketed watertight fittings and shall be securely anchored into the soil  thrust blocks should be installed anytime 90 degree bends are utilized depending on size of pipe and flow these can be constructed with sand bags straw bales staked in place t posts and wire or ecology blocks  pipe needs to be secured along its full length to prevent movement this can be done with steel t posts and wire a post is installed on each side of the pipe and the pipe is wired to them this should be done every 1020 feet of pipe length or so depending on the size of the pipe and quantity of water to diverted  interceptor dikes shall be used to direct runoff into a slope drain the height of the dike shall be at least 1 foot higher at all points than the top of the inlet pipe  the area below the outlet must be stabilized with a riprap apron see bmp ec13 outlet protection for the appropriate outlet material  if the pipe slope drain is conveying sedimentladen water direct all flows into the sediment trapping facility  recommended materials include both metal and plastic pipe either corrugated or smooth wall maintenance standards  check inlet and outlet points regularly especially after storms  the inlet should be free of undercutting and no water should be going around the point of entry if there are problems the headwall should be reinforced with compacted earth or sand bags  the outlet point should be free of erosion and installed with appropriate outlet protection  for permanent installations inspect pipe periodically for vandalism and physical distress such as slides and windthrow  normally the pipe slope is so steep that clogging is not a problem with smooth wall pipe however debris may become lodged in the pipe figure ec101 pipe slope drain from stormwater management manual for western washington washington department of ecology 2001 11 bmp ec11 channel lining purpose to protect erodible channels by providing a channel liner using either blankets or riprap conditions of use  when natural soils or vegetated stabilized soils in a channel are not adequate to prevent channel erosion  when a permanent ditch or pipe system is to be installed and a temporary measure is needed  in almost all cases synthetic and organic coconut blankets are more effective than riprap for protecting channels from erosion blankets can be used with and without vegetation blanketed channels can be designed to handle any expected flow and longevity requirement some synthetic blankets have a predicted life span of 50 years or more even in sunlight  other reasons why blankets are better than rock include the availability of blankets over rock blankets can be delivered anywhere rock requires the use of dump trucks to haul and heavy equipment to place blankets usually only require laborers with hand tools and sometimes a backhoe  the federal highway administration recommends not using flexible liners whenever the slope exceeds 10% or the shear stress exceeds 8 lbsft2 design and installation  see ec17 for information on blankets  disturbance of areas where riprap is to be placed should be undertaken only when final preparation and placement of the riprap can follow immediately behind the initial disturbance where riprap is used for outlet protection the riprap should be placed before or in conjunction with the construction of the pipe or channel so that it is in place when the pipe or channel begins to operate  determine the riprap size that will be stable under the flow conditions based on riprap gradations actually available in the area select the size or sizes that equal or exceed the minimum size the possibility of drainage structure damage by children shall be considered in selecting a riprap size especially if there is nearby water or a gully in which to toss the stones  stone for riprap shall consist of fieldstone or quarry stone of approximately rectangular shape the stone shall be hard and angular and of such quality that it will not disintegrate on exposure to water or weathering and it shall be suitable in all respects for the purpose intended  rubble concrete may be used provided it has a density of at least 150 pounds per cubic foot and otherwise meets the requirement of this standard and specification  a lining of engineering filter fabric geotextile shall be placed between the riprap and the underlying soil surface to prevent soil movement into or riprap the geotextile should be keyed in at the top of the bank  filter fabric shall not be used on slopes greater than 11 as slippage may occur  filter fabric should be used in conjunction with a layer of coarse aggregate granular filter blanket when the riprap to be placed is 12 inches and larger figure ec111 typical grasslined channels from stormwater management manual for western washington washington department of ecology 2001 figure ec112 temporary channel liners from stormwater management manual for western washington washington department of ecology 2001 12 bmp ec12 grassed waterways and outlets purpose a grassed waterway is a natural or constructed waterway or outlet with a vegetative cover of adapted grasses for safe disposal of runoff water without erosion conditions of use  this practice applies to construction sites where concentrated runoff needs to be contained to prevent erosion or flooding and where soil and site conditions are suitable for establishing adequate grass cover  when channel slopes are generally less than 5% and space is available for a relatively large cross section  typical uses include roadside ditches channels at property boundaries outlets for diversions and other channels and drainage ditches in low areas  channels that will be vegetated should be installed before major earthwork and hydroseeded with a bonded fiber mulch bfm the vegetation should be well established ie 75% cover before water is allowed to flow in the ditch with channels that will have high flows erosion control blankets should be installed over the hydroseed if vegetation cannot be established from seed before water is allowed in the ditch sod should be installed in the bottom of the ditch in lieu of hydromulch and blankets  the grass species selected must be appropriate for the carson city area moisture from natural precipitation or irrigation must be adequate to establish and maintain good grass cover design and installation specifications  locate the channel where it can conform to the topography and other features such as roads  locate them to use natural drainage systems to the greatest extent possible  avoid sharp changes in alignment or bends and changes in grade  do not reshape the landscape to fit the drainage channel  design velocities are to be below 5 feet sec  however the design velocity should be based on soil conditions type of vegetation and method of establishment  an established grass or vegetated lining is required before the channel can be used to convey stormwater unless stabilized with nets or blankets  if design velocity of a channel to be vegetated by seeding exceeds 2 feet sec a temporary channel liner is required geotextile or special mulch protection such as fiberglass roving or straw and netting provide stability until the vegetation is fully established  check dams shall be removed when the grass has matured sufficiently to protect the ditch or swale unless the slope of the swale is greater than 4% the area beneath the check dams shall be seeded and mulched immediately after dam removal  if vegetation is established by sodding the permissible velocity for established vegetation may be used and no temporary liner is needed  do not subject grasslined channel to sedimentation from disturbed areas use sedimenttrapping bmps upstream of the channel  vshaped grass channels generally apply where the quantity of water is small such as in short reaches along roadsides the vshaped cross section is least desirable because it is difficult to stabilize the bottom where velocities may be high  trapezoidal grass channels are used where runoff volumes are large and slope is low so that velocities are nonerosive to vegetated linings note it is difficult to construct small parabolic shaped channels  provide outlet protection at culvert ends and at channel intersections  grass channels at a minimum should carry peak runoff for temporary construction drainage facilities from the 10year 24hour storm without eroding where flood hazard exists increase the capacity according to the potential damage  grassed channel side slopes generally are constructed  or flatter to aid in the establishment of vegetation and for maintenance  construct channels a minimum of 02 foot larger around the periphery to allow for soil bulking during seedbed preparations and sod buildup maintenance standards  during the establishment period check grasslined channels after every rainfall  after grass is established periodically check the channel  check it after every heavy rainfall event immediately make repairs  it is particularly important to check the channel outlet and all road crossings for bank stability and evidence of piping or scour holes  remove all significant sediment accumulations to maintain the designed carrying capacity keep the grass in a healthy vigorous condition at all times since it is the primary erosion protection for the channel  protect waterways from excessive grazing and vehicle use  keep waterway clear of debris brush and excess growth  fertilize as needed to maintain grass stand and plant vigor  reseed any damaged or open areas in the grass cover 13 bmp ec13 outlet protection purpose outlet protection prevents scour at conveyance outlets and minimizes the potential for downstream erosion by reducing the velocity of concentrated stormwater flows conditions of use outlet protection is required at the outlets of all ponds pipes ditches or other conveyances and where runoff is conveyed to a natural or manmade drainage feature such as a stream wetland or ditch when discharge velocities and energies at the outlet are sufficient to erode the immediate downstream reach the outlet protection is a physical device composed of rock grouted riprap or concrete rubble placed at the outlet of a pipe or channel to prevent scour of the soil caused by concentrated high velocity flows design and installation specifications  the receiving channel at the outlet of a culvert shall be protected from erosion by rock lining a minimum of 6 feet downstream and extending up the channel sides a minimum of 1foot above the maximum tailwater elevation or 1foot above the crown whichever is higher for large pipes more than 18 inches in diameter the outlet protection lining of the channel is lengthened to four times the diameter of the culvert  standard wing walls and tapered outlets and paved channels should also be considered when appropriate for permanent culvert outlet protection however rock outlet protection is usually less expensive and easier to install than concrete aprons or energy dissipaters rock can also serve to trap sediment and reduce flow velocities  organic or synthetic erosion blankets with or without vegetation are usually more effective than rock cheaper and easier to install materials can be chosen using manufacturer product specifications astm test results are available for most products and the designer can choose the correct material for the expected flow  with low flows vegetation including sod can be effective  the following guidelines shall be used for riprap outlet protection 1 if the discharge velocity at the outlet is less than 5 fps pipe slope less than 1% use 2inch to 8inch riprap minimum thickness is 1foot 2 for 5 to 10 fps discharge velocity at the outlet pipe slope less than 3% use 24inch to 4foot riprap minimum thickness is 2 feet 3 for outlets at the base of steep slope pipes pipe slope greater than 3% an engineered energy dissipater shall be used  filter fabric or erosion control blankets should always be used under riprap to prevent scour and channel erosion  for proper operation of apron align apron with receiving stream and keep straight throughout its length if a curve is needed to fit site conditions place it in upper section of apron maintenance standards  inspect bmp prior to forecast rain daily during extended rain events after rain events weekly during the rainy season and at twoweek intervals during the nonrainy season  inspect apron for displacement of the riprap and damage to the underlying fabric repair fabric and replace riprap that has washed away if riprap continues to wash away consider using larger material  inspect for scour beneath the riprap and around the outlet repair damage to slopes or underlying filter fabric immediately  clean energy dissipater if sediment builds up  remove temporary devices as soon as the surrounding drainage area has been stabilized or at the completion of construction 14 bmp ec14 check dams purpose construction of small dams across a swale or ditch reduces the velocity of concentrated flow and dissipates energy at the check dam check dams reduce the effective slope of the channel thereby reducing the velocity of flowing water allowing sediment to settle and reducing erosion check dams also help keep the flow spread evenly across the bottom of wide trapezoidal cross sections thus helping to prevent scouring conditions of use  where temporary channels or permanent channels are not yet vegetated channel lining is infeasible and velocity checks are required  to promote sedimentation behind the dam  to prevent erosion by reducing the velocity of channel flow in small intermittent channels and temporary swales  in small open channels that drain 10 acres or less  in steep channels where stormwater runoff velocities exceed 5 feet s  in wide trapezoidal cross sections to keep flow spread evenly limitations  not to be used in live streams or in channels with extended base flows  not appropriate in channels that drain areas greater than 10 acres  not appropriate in channels that are already grasslined unless erosion is expected as installation may damage vegetation  require extensive maintenance following high velocity flows  promotes sediment trapping which can be resuspended during subsequent storms or removal of the check dam design and installation specifications  whatever material is used the dam should form a triangle when viewed from the side this prevents undercutting as water flows over the face of the dam rather than falling directly onto the ditch bottom  check dams in association with sumps work more effectively at slowing flow and retaining sediment than just a check dam alone a deep sump should be provided immediately upstream of the check dam  in some cases if carefully located and designed check dams can remain as permanent installations with very minor regrading they may be left as either spillways in which case accumulated sediment would be graded and seeded or as check dams to prevent further sediment from leaving the site  check dams can be constructed of either rock or peagravel filled bags numerous products are also available for this purpose they tend to be reusable quick and easy to install effective and cost efficient  design check dams so that the capacity of the waterway remains adequate for the design flow  check dams should be placed perpendicular to the flow of water  the maximum spacing between the dams shall be such that the toe of the upstream dam is at the same elevation as the top of the downstream dam  keep the maximum height at 2 feet at the center of the dam  keep the center of the check dam at least 12 inches lower than the outer edges at natural ground elevation  keep the side slopes of the check dam at  or flatter  key the stone into the ditch banks and extend it beyond the abutments a minimum of 18 inches to avoid washouts from overflow around the ends of the dam  use filter fabric foundation under a rock or sand bag check dam if a blanket ditch liner is used this is not necessary a piece of organic or synthetic blanket cut to fit will also work for this purpose  rock check dams shall be constructed of appropriately sized rock the rock must be placed by hand or by mechanical means no dumping of rock to form dam to achieve complete coverage of the ditch or swale and to ensure that the center of the dam is lower than the edges the rock used must be large enough to stay in place given the expected design flow velocities channel  in the case of grasslined ditches and swales all check dams and accumulated sediment shall be removed when the grass has matured sufficiently to protect the ditch or swale  unless the slope of the swale is greater than 4% the area beneath the check dams shall be seeded and mulched immediately after dam removal  ensure that channel appurtenances such as culvert entrances below check dams are not subject to damage or blockage from displaced stones maintenance standards  inspect bmps prior to forecast rain

have degraded or have become damaged  if the check dam is used as a sediment capture device sediment that accumulates in the bmp must be periodically removed in order to maintain bmp effectiveness sediment should be removed when the sediment accumulation reaches onethird of the barrier height sediment removed during maintenance may be incorporated into earthwork on the site or disposed at an appropriate location  if significant erosion occurs between dams install a protective riprap liner in that portion of the channel  remove check dam and accumulated sediment when check dams are no

straw and bark mulches are used in landscape areas as ornamental decoration soil stabilization and areas recently seeded mulches are used to protect the soil surface from raindrop and irrigation impact to create a microenvironment to increase infiltration to conserve moisture around tree and shrub plantings to prevent soil compaction or crusting and to decrease runoff applicability bark and wood chip mulches as applicable to any landscape area where trees and shrubs have been planted straw mulch is utilized in new seedings to create a microenvironment protect the soil surface and improve seed germination planning criteria wood chips can be produced onsite by processing tree trunks limbs and branches in a wood chipper chips should range in size from 12 to 3inches in length 12 to 112inches in width and 13  to 12inch in thickness chips produced from tree trimmings with significant quantities of leaves or small twigs are not effective as mulch straw mulches are widely used in revegetation projects straw must be anchored to the soil by one or more of the following methods to prevent wind blowing  crimping rolling disking or punching  covering with netting or  spraying with a chemical or tackifier the steeper the slope or in wind prone areas the greater the need for anchoring the straw bark requires a large tree source for on site processing or it can be purchased in varying sizes the larger sizes greater than 6inches withstand wind and are not as likely to move methods and materials wood or bark chips may be processed from any clean green soft wood a permeable landscape cloth should be placed over the soil surface and the chips blown or spread by hand to a uniform thickness which fully covers the project area excess chips can be safely returned to the undisturbed forest floor to supplement existing organic cover chips should not be used on decomposed granite slopes over 30% only clean wheat barley oat or rice straw should be utilized to prevent the spread of noxious weeds straw can be blown on or applied by hand to a uniform depth of approximately 2inches or approximately 2 tons per acre the straw must be anchored by an appropriate method immediately after application slopes steeper than  and areas adjacent to streams or drainages should be netted to prevent sliding of material and material entering the watercourse maintenance mulched areas must be regularly inspected for damage and remulched as necessary inspections and repairs should also be conducted after precipitation or storm events effectiveness wood chip and bark mulches deteriorate slower than the wood fiber in hydromulches and therefore retain their effectiveness longer wood chips and bark are heavier than straw and less subject to removal by wind straw mulch is very effective if it is applied anchored and maintained properly 16 bmp ec16 plastic covering purpose plastic covering provides immediate shortterm erosion protection to slopes and disturbed areas conditions of use  plastic covering may be used on disturbed areas that require cover measures for less than 30 days except as stated below  plastic is particularly useful for protecting cut and fill slopes and stockpiles note the relatively rapid breakdown of most polyethylene sheeting makes it unsuitable for longterm greater than six months applications  clear plastic sheeting can be used over newlyseeded areas to create a greenhouse effect and encourage grass growth if the hydroseed was installed too late in the season to establish 75% grass cover or if the wet season started earlier than normal clear plastic should not be used for this purpose during the summer months because the resulting high temperatures can kill the grass  due to rapid runoff caused by plastic sheeting this method shall not be used upslope of areas that might be adversely impacted by concentrated runoff such areas include steep andor unstable slopes  while plastic is inexpensive to purchase the added cost of installation maintenance removal and disposal make this an expensive material up to $150200 per square yard  whenever plastic is used to protect slopes water collection measures must be installed at the base of the slope these measures include plasticcovered berms channels and pipes used to convey clean rainwater away from bare soil and disturbed areas at no time is clean runoff from a plastic covered slope to be mixed with dirty runoff from a project  other uses for plastic include 1 temporary ditch liner 2 pond liner in temporary sediment pond 3 liner for bermed temporary fuel storage area if plastic is not reactive to the type of fuel being stored 4 emergency slope protection during heavy rains and 5 temporary drainpipe elephant trunk used to direct water design and installation specifications  plastic slope cover must be installed as follows 1 run plastic up and down slope not across slope 2 plastic may be installed perpendicular to a slope if the slope length is less than 10 feet 3 minimum of 8inch overlap at seams 4 on long or wide slopes or slopes subject to wind all seams should be taped 5 place plastic into a small 12inch wide by 6inch deep slot trench at the top of the slope and backfill with soil to keep water from flowing underneath 6 place sand filled burlap or geotextile bags every 3 to 6 feet along seams and pound a wooden stake to hold them in place 7 inspect plastic for rips tears and open seams regularly and repair immediately this prevents high velocity runoff from contacting bare soil that causes extreme erosion 8 sandbags may be lowered into place tied to ropes however all sandbags must be staked in place  plastic sheeting shall have a minimum thickness of 006 millimeters 25 mils  if erosion at the toe of a slope is likely a gravel berm riprap or other suitable protection shall be installed at the toe of the slope in order to reduce the velocity of runoff maintenance standards  torn sheets must be replaced and open seams repaired  if the plastic begins to deteriorate due to ultraviolet radiation  it must be completely removed and replaced  when the plastic is no longer needed it shall be completely removed 17 bmp ec17 jute & synthetic netting and blankets purpose erosion control nets and blankets are intended to prevent erosion and hold seed and mulch in place on steep slopes and in channels so that vegetation can become well established netting provides stability to surface disturbances and reduces the soil erosion potential nets commonly called matting are strands of material woven into an open but hightensile strength net for example coconut fiber matting blankets are strands of material that are not tightly woven but instead form a layer of interlocking fibers typically held together by a biodegradable or photodegradable netting for example excelsior or straw blankets they generally have lower tensile strength than nets but cover the ground more completely coir coconut fiber fabric comes as both nets and blankets netting is applicable to any situation that straw or wood chip mulch is utilized typical applications include revegetation of surface disturbances road cut and fill slopes ski slopes mine reclamation sites etc netting can be utilized in both temporary and permanent applications conditions of use erosion control nets and blankets should be used  to aid permanent vegetated stabilization of slopes 2h 1v or greater and with more than 10 feet of vertical relief  for drainage ditches and swales highly recommended the application of appropriate netting or blanket to drainage ditches and swales can protect bare soil from channelized runoff while vegetation is established nets and blankets also can capture a great deal of sediment due to their open porous structure synthetic nets and blankets can be used to permanently stabilize channels and may provide a costeffective environmentally preferable alternative to riprap 100% synthetic blankets manufactured for use in ditches may be easily reused as temporary ditch liners disadvantages of blankets include  surface preparation required  on slopes steeper than 2 blanket installers may need to be roped and harnessed for safety  they cost at least $40006000 per acre installed advantages of blankets include  can be installed without mobilizing special equipment  can be installed by anyone with minimal training  can be installed in stages or phases as the project progresses  seed and fertilizer can be handplaced by the installers as they progress down the slope  can be installed in any weather  there are numerous types of blankets that can be designed with various parameters in mind those parameters include fiber blend mesh strength longevity biodegradability cost and availability design and installation specifications  seed andor mulch the disturbed areas  starting above the mulched andor seeded area anchor the top end of the netting by burying it in a trench at least 4 inches deep by 8 inches wide  backfill and compact the excavated material into this trench  the netting should extend beyond the edge of the mulched or seeded area at least 1 foot on the sides and 3 feet at the top and bottom fasten with a row of wire stapes on 1foot centers  roll the netting out perpendicular with the slope and secure with staples on 3foot centers the u shaped staples should be 6 inches to 10 inches long with a 1inch crown longer staples should be used in loose or sandy soils  overlap netting at least 1 foot on the sides and secure with staples on 1foot centers along the overlap  overlap the lower end of the uphill strip over the downhill strip at least 1 foot and secure with staples on 1 foot centers  continue adding strips of netting until the entire mulched area is covered and secured with staples  the netting should be cut to fit around protruding rocks or other large objects and tucked in around smaller rocks or objects preventing bridging maintenance standards  good contact with the ground must be maintained and erosion must not occur beneath the net or blanket  any areas of the net or blanket that are damaged or not in close contact with the ground shall be repaired and stapled  if erosion occurs due to poorly controlled drainage the problem shall be fixed and the eroded area protected figure ec171 typical installation detail from california stormwater bmp handbook construction california storm water quality association 2003 figure ec172 typical installation detail from california stormwater bmp handbook construction california storm water quality association 2003 18 bmp ec18 rock riprap purpose rock riprap is a layer of loose rock placed over an erodible soil or surface disturbance to protect the soil surface provide for slope stabilization on steep slopes and reduce soil erosion within a project area conditions of use  rock riprap is primarily utilized in drainage stabilization projects such as channel and ditch linings and energy dissipaters  rock riprap is used on steep difficult slopes where vegetation has not been successful  seed shrubs and trees have been incorporated with rock riprap by interplanting  a source of rock riprap of the appropriate size and the associated transportation cost are the primary planning criteria  depending upon the application rock riprap can be utilized with revegetation efforts but the establishment of permanent vegetation is preferred for longterm stability and maintenance  rock riprap applied to active drainageways or channels usually requires an underlining of matting or fabric to prevent erosion  rock riprapping is an effective means of reducing soil erosion in channels and drainageways design and installation specifications  the rock riprap should be sound dense and durable rock with a specific gravity of not less than 212 and greater than 12 inches in diameter  seeding should occur prior to rock placement  if to be used within an active drainage channel a synthetic mat or fabric should be installed prior to rock placement  depending on the specifics of the site rock riprap can be placed by hand or by equipment  existing trees and vegetation should be protected and rock riprap placed by hand in these areas  rocks should be securely bedded and homogenous in the layering  depth of application depends upon the size of the drainageway slope degree and length and the other specifics of the site maintenance standards  inspect bmp prior to forecast rain daily during extended rain events after rain events weekly during the rainy season and at twoweek intervals during the nonrainy season  inspect for displacement of the riprap and damage to the underlying fabric repair fabric and replace riprap that has washed away if riprap continues to wash away consider using larger material  inspect for scour beneath the riprap and repair immediately  remove temporary devices as soon as the surrounding drainage area has been stabilized or at the completion of construction 19 bmp ec19 polyacrylamide pam for soil erosion protection purpose polyacrylamide pam is used on construction sites to prevent soil erosion applying pam to bare soil in advance of a rain event significantly reduces erosion and controls sediment in two ways first pam increases the soils available pore volume thus increasing infiltration reducing the quantity of stormwater runoff second it increases flocculation of suspended particles and aids in their deposition thus reducing stormwater runoff turbidity and improving water quality conditions of use  pam is suitable for use on disturbed soil area that discharge to a sediment trap or sediment basin  pam is typically used in conjunction with other bmps to increase their performance  pam can be applied to the following areas  rough graded soils that will be inactive for a period of time  final graded soils before application of final stabilization eg paving planting mulching  haul roads prior to placement of crushed rock surfacing  compacted soil road base  construction staging materials storage and layout areas  soil stockpiles  areas that will be mulched limitations  pam must not be directly applied to water or allowed to enter a water body  do not use pam on a slope that flows into a water body without passing sediment trap or sediment basin  pam will work when applied to saturated soil but is not as effective as applications to dry or damp soil  on all sites the use of silt fence shall be maximized to limit the discharges of sediment from the site  all areas not being actively worked shall be covered and protected from rainfall pam shall not be the only cover bmp used  some pams are more toxic and carcinogenic than others only the most environmentally safe pam products should be used  pam designated for erosion and sediment control should be water soluble or linear or noncross linked  pam combined with water is very slippery and can be a safety hazard care must be taken to prevent spills of pam powder onto paved surfaces during an application of pam prevent overspray from reaching pavement as pavement will become slippery if pam powder gets on skin or clothing wipe it off with a rough towel rather than washing with waterthis only makes cleanup messier and take longer  a sampling and analysis plan must be incorporated into the swppp as pam may be considered to be a source of nonvisible pollutants design and installation specifications  pam may be applied in dissolved form with water or it may be applied in dry granular or powdered form the preferred application method is the dissolved form pam is to be applied at a maximum rate of 12 pound pam per 1000 gallons water per 1 acre of bare soil higher concentrations of pam do not provide any additional effectiveness  premeasure the area where pam is to be applied and calculate the amount of product and water necessary to provide coverage at the specified application rate 12 pound pam1000 gallonsunit per acre  pam has infinite solubility in water but dissolves very slowly dissolve premeasured dry granular pam with a known quantity of clean water in a bucket several hours or overnight mechanical mixing will help dissolve the pam always add pam to water  not water to pam  prefill the water truck about 18 full with water the water does not have to be potable but it must have relatively low turbidity  in the range of 20 ntu or less  add pamwater mixture to the truck  completely fill the water truck to specified volume  spray pamwater mixture onto dry soil until the soil surface is uniformly and completely wetted  pam may be applied as a powder at the rate of 5 lbs per acre this must be applied on a day that is dry for areas less than 510 acres a handheld organ grinder fertilizer spreader set to the smallest setting will work tractormounted spreaders will work for larger areas maintenance standards the following shall be used for application of pam  pam may be reapplied on actively worked areas after a 48hour period  proper application and reapplication plans are necessary to ensure total effectiveness of pam usage  reapplication is not required unless pam treated soil is disturbed or unless turbidity levels show the need for an additional application if pam treated soil is left undisturbed a reapplication may be necessary after two months more pam applications may be required for steep slopes silty and clayey soils usda classification type c and d soils long grades and high precipitation areas when pam is applied first to bare soil and then covered with straw a reapplication may not be necessary for several months 20 bmp ec20 topsoiling purpose to provide a suitable growth medium for final site stabilization with vegetation while not a permanent cover practice in itself topsoiling is an integral component of providing permanent cover in those areas where there is an unsuitable soil surface for plant growth native soils and disturbed soils that have been organically amended not only retain much more stormwater but they also serve as effective biofilters for urban pollutants and by supporting more vigorous plant growth reduce the water fertilizer and pesticides needed to support installed landscapes topsoil does not include any subsoils but only the material from the top several inches including organic debris conditions of use  native soils should be left undisturbed to the maximum extent practicable native soils disturbed during clearing and grading should be restored to the maximum extent practicable to a condition where moistureholding capacity is equal to or better than the original site conditions this criterion can be met by using onsite native topsoil incorporating amendments into onsite soil or importing blended topsoil  topsoiling is a required procedure when establishing vegetation on shallow soils and soils of critically low ph high acid levels  stripping of existing properly functioning soil system and vegetation for the purpose of topsoiling during construction is not acceptable if an existing soil system is functioning properly it shall be preserved in its undisturbed and uncompacted condition  depending on where the topsoil comes from or what vegetation was on site before disturbance invasive plant seeds may be included and could cause problems for establishing native plants landscaped areas or grasses  topsoil from the site will contain mycorrhizal bacteria that are necessary for healthy root growth and nutrient transfer these native mycorrhiza are acclimated to the site and will provide optimum conditions for establishing grasses commercially available mycorrhiza products should be used when topsoil is brought in from offsite design and installation specifications if topsoiling is to be done the following items should be considered  maximize the depth of the topsoil wherever possible to provide the maximum possible infiltration capacity and beneficial growth medium topsoil depth shall be at least 8 inches with a minimum organic content of 10% dry weight and ph between 60 and 80 or matching the ph of the undisturbed soil this can be accomplished either by returning native topsoil to the site andor incorporating organic amendments organic amendments should be incorporated to a minimum 8inch depth except where tree roots or other natural features limit the depth of incorporation subsoils below the 12inch depth should be scarified at least 2 inches to avoid stratified layers where feasible the decision to either layer topsoil over a subgrade or incorporate topsoil into the underlying layer may vary depending on the planting specified  if blended topsoil is imported fines should be limited to 25% passing sieve  the final composition and construction of the soil system will result in a natural selection of certain plant species over time  locate the topsoil stockpile so that it meets specifications and does not interfere with work on the site it may be possible to locate more than one pile in proximity to areas where topsoil will be used  allow sufficient time in scheduling for topsoil to be spread prior to seeding sodding or planting  care must be taken not to apply to subsoil if the two soils have contrasting textures sandy topsoil over clayey subsoil is a particularly poor combination as water creeps along the junction between the soil layers and causes the topsoil to slough  if topsoil and subsoil are not properly bonded water will not infiltrate the soil profile evenly and it will be difficult to establish vegetation the best method to prevent a lack of bonding is to actually work the topsoil into the layer below for a depth of at least 6 inches  ripping or restructuring the subgrade may also provide additional benefits regarding the overall infiltration and interflow dynamics of the soil system  field exploration of the site shall be made to determine if there is surface soil of sufficient quantity and quality to justify stripping  topsoil shall be friable and loamy loam sandy loam silt loam sandy clay loam clay loam areas of natural ground water recharge should be avoided  stripping shall be confined to the immediate construction area a 4 to 6 inch stripping depth is common but depth may vary depending on the particular soil all surface runoff control structures shall be in place prior to stripping stockpiling of topsoil shall occur in the following manner  side slopes of the stockpile shall not exceed   an interceptor dike with gravel outlet and silt fence shall surround all topsoil stockpiles during the rainy season or if the stockpile will remain in place for a longer period of time than active construction grading  erosion control seeding or covering with clear plastic or other mulching materials of stockpiles shall be completed within 7 days of the formation of the stockpile native topsoil stockpiles shall not be covered with plastic  topsoil shall not be placed while in a frozen or muddy condition when the subgrade is excessively wet or when conditions exist that may otherwise be detrimental to proper grading or proposed sodding or seeding  previously established grades on the areas to be topsoiled shall be maintained according to the approved plan  when native topsoil is to be stockpiled and reused the following should apply to ensure that the mycorrhizal bacterial earthworms and other beneficial organisms will not be destroyed 1 topsoil is to be reinstalled within 4 to 6 weeks 2 topsoil is not to become saturated with water 3 plastic cover is not allowed maintenance standards  inspect stockpiles regularly especially after large storm events stabilize any areas that have eroded 21 bmp ec21 seeding practices purpose seeding practices include a variety of techniques which result in the sowing or planting of seeds common practices include broadcast seeding hand or mechanical drill seeding aerial seeding and hydroseeding the primary purpose of seeding a site is for soil stabilization establishment of a vegetative cover related objectives include to reduce raindrop impacts and surface water flow to reduce erosion from wind and water and to enhance aesthetics and the natural environment conditions of use  seeding practices are applicable to any surface disturbance site requiring revegetation or reclamation  slopes must be mechanically stabilized prior to seeding as vegetation alone will not stabilize a slope  drilling seeding is typically limited to slopes of  or flatter but it is the most successful practice  hydroseeding is most effective in steep slope situations which have little or no access eg road cut or fill slopes mine waste dumps etc  broadcast seeding is less expensive but requires approximately twice the amount of seed over drill seeding  aerial seedings are typically applied in large areas with no access such as forest or rangeland fires   planning criteria  the establishment of vegetation is the most efficient and cost effective form of erosion control and soil stabilization once established vegetation absorbs raindrop impact and prevents the mobilization of soil particles vegetation prevents erosion while other treatments such as filter fabric sediment basins or filter strips only treat the sediment mobilization process  seeding practices should be selected based upon the specifics of the site and the expertise of a qualified professional should be consulted  typically economics site topography andor access are controlling factors in the selection process seeding practices should also be tailored to the plant material seed being applied ie grasses forbs shrubs  tree species are typically planted from container stock after establishment of a grassforbshrub cover  seeding practices are usually incorporated within a combined structural and vegetative approach to soil stabilization  vegetation alone will not stabilize a slope other nonvegetative techniques are also utilized to enhance the success of a seeding such as mulches netting matting and chemical tacifiers  irrigation will assist in achieving a good seedsoil contact and is critical to plant establishment on dry sites over watering will cause washing and runoff thus potentially transporting seed down gradient design and installation specifications vegetation or reclamation specialists should be consulted regarding mulch application rates plant species selection seeding rates etc to ensure a successful project  broadcast seeding hand or mechanical broadcast seeding can be accomplished by hand held seeders or a mechanically driven seeder typically mounted on a tractor or atv vehicle the seed mix is placed in a hopper adjustments are made for the size of the seed and rate of application and the seeder is operated by a hand crank or motor while walking or driving over the areas to be seeded broadcast seeding typically require twice the amount of seed to cover the same given area as a drill seeder due to wind drift wildlife consumption and lack of good soil to seed contact  drill seeding drill seeding requires the use of a range drill or equivalent depending on the condition of the site drill seeders are pulled behind a tractor or bulldozer and actually place the seed to a predetermined depth the seed is then covered by the drill mechanism or a chain drag is utilized to cover the seed behind the drill drill seeding provides the best seed to soil contact and correspondingly the highest success rate  aerial seeding aerial seeding is conducted by helicopter or fixed wing aircraft and can cover larger areas of inaccessible terrain it is the most efficient method for large disturbance areas such as forest or rangeland fires germination success is usually low given wind drift soil conditions and poor seed to soil contact but application timing can greatly improve success if seeding can occur shortly after a wild land fire and before a soil crust is formed success is greatly improved  hydroseeding the wood fiber and water mixture are well agitated in a large tank and then blown hose and nozzle by compressed air the apparatus is typically truck or trailer mounted and has sufficient capacity to complete several acres at a time mulch application rates andor seeding rates depend upon the site specifics of the project area and the project goals typically irrigation is necessary to successfully establish a vegetative cover with hydroseeding maintenance  seeded areas require regular inspection and potentially reapplication if necessary  the treatment areas should be protected from foot or vehicle traffic until vegetation is well established which may require fencing barriers and signing 22 bmp ec22 sodding purpose the purpose of sodding is to establish permanent turf for immediate erosion protection and to stabilize drainage ways where concentrated overland flow will occur conditions of use sodding may be used in the following areas  disturbed areas that require shortterm or longterm cover  disturbed areas that require immediate vegetative cover  all waterways that require vegetative lining waterways may also be seeded rather than sodded and protected with a net or blanket design and installation specifications sod shall be free of weeds of uniform thickness approximately 1inch thick and shall have a dense root mat for mechanical strength the following steps are recommended for sod installation  shape and smooth the surface to final grade in accordance with the approved grading plan the swale needs to be over excavated 4 to 6 inches below design elevation to allow room for placing soil amendment and sod  amend 4 inches minimum of compost into the top 8 inches of the soil if the organic content of the soil is less than ten percent or the permeability is less than 06

ends of each strip to provide for a close tight fit stagger joints at least 12 inches staple on slopes steeper than 3h 1v staple the upstream edge of each sod strip  roll the sodded area and irrigate  when sodding is carried out in alternating strips or other patterns seed the areas between the sods immediately after sodding maintenance standards if the grass is unhealthy the cause shall be determined and appropriate action taken to reestablish a healthy groundcover if it is impossible to establish a healthy groundcover due to frequent saturation instability or some other cause the sod

stabilized to reduce the amount of sediment transported onto paved roads by vehicles or equipment by constructing a stabilized pad of quarry spalls at entrances to construction sites conditions of use construction entrances shall be stabilized wherever traffic will be leaving a construction site and traveling on paved roads or other paved areas within 1000 feet of the site on large commercial highway and road projects the designer should include enough extra materials in the contract to allow for additional stabilized entrances not shown in the initial construction swppp it is difficult to determine exactly where access to these projects will take place  additional materials will enable the contractor to install them where needed design and installation specifications  a separation geotextile shall be placed under the spalls to prevent fine sediment from pumping up into the rock pad the geotextile shall meet the following standards  grab tensile strength astm d4751 200 psi min  grab tensile elongation astm d4632 30% max  mullen burst strength astm d378680a 400 psi min  aos astm d4751 2045 us standard sieve size  consider early installation of the first lift of asphalt in areas that will be paved  this can be used as a stabilized entrance also consider the installation of excess concrete as a stabilized entrance during large concrete pours excess concrete is often available for this purpose  hog fuel woodbased mulch may be substituted for or combined with quarry spalls in areas that will not be used for permanent roads hog fuel is generally less effective at stabilizing construction entrances and should be used only at sites where the amount of traffic is very limited hog fuel is not recommended for entrance stabilization in urban areas the effectiveness of hog fuel is highly variable and it generally requires more maintenance than quarry spalls the inspector may at any time require the use of quarry spalls if the hog fuel is not preventing sediment from being tracked onto pavement or if the hog fuel is being carried onto pavement hog fuel is prohibited in permanent roadbeds because organics in the subgrade soils cause degradation of the subgrade support over time  fencing see bmp ec4 shall be installed as necessary to restrict traffic to the construction entrance  whenever possible the entrance shall be constructed on a firm compacted subgrade this can substantially increase the effectiveness of the pad and reduce the need for maintenance maintenance standards  quarry spalls or hog fuel shall be added if the pad is no longer in accordance with the specifications  if the entrance is not preventing sediment from being tracked onto pavement then alternative measures to keep the streets free of sediment shall be used this may include street sweeping an increase in the dimensions of the entrance or the installation of a wheel wash  any sediment that is tracked onto pavement shall be removed by shoveling or street sweeping the sediment collected by sweeping shall be removed or stabilized on site the pavement shall not be cleaned by washing down the street except when sweeping is ineffective and there is a threat to public safety if it is necessary to wash the streets the construction of a small sump shall be considered the sediment would then be washed into the sump where it can be controlled  any quarry spalls that are loosened from the pad which end up on the roadway shall be removed immediately  if vehicles are entering or exiting the site at points other than the construction entrances fencing see bmp ec4 shall be installed to control traffic  upon project completion and site stabilization all construction accesses intended as permanent access for maintenance shall be permanently stabilized

weekly during the rainy season and at twoweek intervals in the nonrainy season to verify continued bmp implementation  inspect local roads adjacent to the site daily sweep or vacuum to remove visible accumulated sediment  remove quarry spalls separate and dispose of sediment if construction entranceexit is clogged with sediment  keep all temporary roadway ditches clear  check for damage and repair as needed  remove all sediment deposited on paved roadways within 24 hours  remove stabilized construction entrance at completion of construction figure sc11 stabilized construction entrance from stormwater management manual for western washington washington department of ecology 2001 2 bmp sc2 wheel wash purpose wheel washes reduce the amount of sediment transported onto paved roads by motor vehicles conditions of use when a stabilized construction entrance see sc1 is not preventing sediment from being tracked onto pavement  wheel washing is generally an effective bmp when installed with careful attention to topography for example a wheel wash can be detrimental if installed at the top of a slope abutting a rightofway where the water from the dripping truck can run unimpeded into the street  pressure washing combined with an adequately sized and surfaced pad with direct drainage to a large 10foot x 10foot sump can be very effective design and installation specifications  suggested details are shown in figure sc21  a minimum of 6 inches of asphalt treated base atb over crushed base material or 8 inches over a good subgrade is recommended to pave the wheel wash use a low clearance truck to test the wheel wash before paving either a belly dump or lowboy will work well to test clearance  keep the water level from 12 to 14 inches deep to avoid damage to truck hubs and filling the truck tongues with water  midpoint spray nozzles are only needed in extremely muddy conditions  wheel wash systems should be designed with a small grade change 6 to 12 inches for a 10footwide pond to allow sediment to flow to the low side of pond to help prevent resuspension of sediment  a drainpipe with a 2 to 3foot riser should be installed on the low side of the pond to allow for easy cleaning and refilling  polymers may be used to promote coagulation and flocculation in a closedloop system polyacrylamide pam added to the wheel wash water at a rate of 025  05 pounds per 1000 gallons of water increases effectiveness and reduces cleanup time if pam is already being used for dust or erosion control and is being applied by a water truck the same truck can be used to change the wash water maintenance standards  the wheel wash should start out the day with fresh water  the wash water should be changed a minimum of once per day on large earthwork jobs where more than 1020 trucks per hour are expected the wash water will need to be changed more often  wheel wash or tire bath wastewater shall be discharged to a separate onsite treatment system such as closedloop recirculation or land application or to the sanitary sewer with proper approval figure sc21 wheel wash from stormwater management manual for western washington washington department of

from leaving the site see figure sc31 for details on straw bale barriers conditions of use  below disturbed areas subject to sheet and rill erosion  straw bales are among the most used and least effective bmps the best use of a straw bale is hand spread on the site  where the size of the drainage area is no greater than 14 acre per 100 feet of barrier length  the maximum slope length behind the barrier is 100 feet  and the maximum slope gradient behind the barrier is   where effectiveness is required for less than three months  under no circumstances should straw bale barriers be

storm drain inlet protection purpose to prevent coarse sediment from entering drainage systems prior to permanent stabilization of the disturbed area conditions of use  where storm drain inlets are to be made operational before permanent stabilization of the disturbed drainage area  protection should be provided for all storm drain inlets down slope and within 500 feet of a disturbed or construction area unless the runoff that enters the catch basin will be conveyed to a sediment pond or trap  inlet protection may be used anywhere to protect the drainage system it is likely that the drainage system will still require cleaning  all of the methods for storm drain inlet protection are prone to plugging and require a high frequency of maintenance  drainage areas should be limited to 1 acre or less  emergency overflows may be required where stormwater ponding would cause a hazard if an emergency overflow is provided additional endofpipe treatment may be required design and

the sandbag barriers are useful on streets which receive runoff flows of less than 05 cubic feet per second cfs for the ten year 24 hour design storm design and installation specifications  the sandbag curb inlet sediment barriers are for drainage areas of less than 1 acre  sandbag curb inlet sediment barriers are designed to keep sediment out of the storm drain system when the roads are already paved  a small area of sediment storage should be provided behind the sandbags  the sandbag should be of plastic woven material rather than burlap burlap bags rot and deteriorate and as a result can cause more problems if broken  clean washed sand should be used to fill the bags  the sandbags should be placed in a curved row from the top of the curb to at least 3 feet into the street  the row should be at least 6 feet from the inlet and curved at the ends which should be pointing uphill  several layers of bags should be overlapped and packed tightly together in order to eliminate any spaces between the bags  leave a 6inch gap in the middle of the top row of sandbags to serve as the spillway maintenance standards  inspect bmps prior to forecast rain daily during extended rain events after rain events weekly during the rainy season and at twoweek intervals during the nonrainy season  sandbags exposed to sunlight will need to be replaced every two to three months due to degradation of the bags  reshape and replace sandbags as needed  repair washouts or other damage as needed  accumulated sediment should be removed and placed where it will not enter the storm drain sediment should be removed when the sediment accumulation reaches onethird of the barrier height sediment removed during maintenance may be incorporated into earthwork on the site or disposed at an appropriate location  additional sediment storage capacity can be obtained by constructing a series of sand bag barriers along the curb and gutter so that each barrier traps a small amount of sediment  remove sandbags when no longer needed remove sediment accumulation and clean regrade and stabilize the area figure sc51 curb and gutter barrier from stormwater management manual for western

barrier to sediment and reducing the runoff velocities of overland flow conditions of use  brush barriers may be used down slope of all disturbed areas of less than onequarter acre  brush barriers are not intended to treat concentrated flows nor are they intended to treat substantial amounts of overland flow any concentrated flows must be conveyed drainage system to a sediment pond or trap the only

revegetation technique consisting of placing bundles of willow cuttings in shallow trenches on the contour of either cut or fill slopes to stabilize cut or fill slopes to stabilize the surface to reduce the velocity of surface runoff to trap sediment to increase infiltration and to establish vegetation conditions of use  applicable to surface disturbances involving cut or fill slopes  angle of repose is excessively steep  as a type of revegetation wattling is applicable on moist site or seeped areas  wattling is a valuable method to help achieve surface stability on a cut or fill slope which is near its angle of repose but continues to erode due to surface runoff  wattling bundles can vegetatively root and sprout and continue to stabilize slope surfaces as a revegetation planting rooting and sprouting will occur if adequate moisture is available at the time of placement and the first growing season  temporary irrigation can be very effective during establishment  the placement of the wattling bundles along the contours can reduce slope lengths which can provide long uninterrupted paths for surface runoff  the rows of wattling bundles act as small sediment traps and increases the amount of infiltration on site wattling should not be prescribed as a treatment on cut banks with shallow soils the increased infiltration will saturate the subsoil and may lead to soil slippage and landslides design criteria the followings steps for preparing and placing the wattling bundles are recommended  wattling bundles should be prepared from living branches of willow salix spp within or near the project area willow is the ideal material because it sprouts and roots easily branches are long straight and flexible wattling material can be cut with lopping shears chain saws or power brush cutting saws  wattling bundles may vary length depending on the material available bundles 5 feet long are the easiest to work with bundles shall taper at the ends and shall be 1 to 12 feet longer than the average length of stems used to achieve this taper the butts of individual stems shall not vary more than one half inch in diameter  stems shall be placed alternately randomly in each bundle so that approximately onehalf of the butt ends are at each end of the bundle  when compressed firmly and tied each bundle shall be approximately eight inches in diameter  bundles shall be tied on not more than 15inch centers with two warps of binder twine or heavier tying material with a nonslipping knot  bundles shall be prepared in advance of placement and kept covered and wet they may be prepared up to seven days in advance of placement  grade for the wattling trenches shall be stakes with an abney level or similar device and shall follow parallel to slope contours horizontal  trenches shall be three feet vertical spacing or such other spacing specified economics may dictate wider placement  bundles shall be laid in trenches dug to approximately onehalf the diameter of the bundles with ends of bundles overlapping at least 12 inches the overlap shall be as long as necessary to permit staking as specified below  bundles shall be staked firmly in place with vertical stakes on the downhill side of the wattling vertical stakes should be spaced not more than 18 inches on center and diagonal stakes bundles on not more than 20inch centers where bundle overlap occurs between previously set bottom or guide stakes an additional bottom stake shall be used on the midpoint of the overlap bundle overlaps shall be tied with a diagonal stake ends of both bundles  stakes may be

hold and a minimum of 18 inches deep where soils are soft and 24inch stakes are not solid ie if they can be moved by hand 36 inch stakes shall be used where soils are so compacted that 24 inch stakes cannot be driven 18 inches deep 38  12 inch steel reinforcing bar shall be used for staking  work shall progress from the bottom of the cut or fill toward the top and each row shall be covered with soil and packed firmly behind and on the uphill side of the wattling by tamping or by walking on the wattling as the work progresses or by a combination of these methods  the downhill lip of the wattling bundle shall be left exposed when staking and covering are completed however the preceding specifications must be rigorously adhered to maintenance standards  inspect bmps prior to forecast rain daily during extended rain events after rain events weekly during the rainy season and at twoweek intervals during the nonrainy season  inspection and repair is especially important during the first year  immediately replace or repair any stakes or bundles that have worked out of the ground  immediately repair any slope sloughing or gully formed due to failure of the wattles figure sc121 wattling from handbook of best management practices nevada division of environmental protection and nevada division of conservation districts 1994 13 bmp sc13 straw wattles purpose straw wattles are temporary erosion and sediment control barriers consisting of straw that is wrapped in biodegradable tubular plastic or similar encasing material they reduce the velocity and can spread the flow of rill and sheet runoff and can capture and retain sediment straw wattles are typically 8 to 10 inches in diameter and 25 to 30 feet in length the wattles are placed in shallow trenches and staked along the contour of disturbed or newly constructed slopes conditions of use  disturbed areas that require immediate erosion protection  exposed soils during the period of short construction delays or over winter months  on slopes requiring stabilization until permanent vegetation can be established  straw wattles are effective for one to two seasons  if conditions are appropriate wattles can be staked to the ground using willow cuttings for added revegetation  rilling can occur beneath wattles if not properly entrenched and water can pass between wattles if not tightly abutted together design criteria  it is critical that wattles are installed perpendicular to the flow direction and parallel to the slope contour  narrow trenches should be dug across the slope on contour to a depth of 3 to 5 inches on clay soils and soils with gradual slopes on loose soils steep slopes and areas with high rainfall the trenches should be dug to a depth of 5 to 7 inches or 12 to 23 of the thickness of the wattle  start building trenches and installing wattles from the base of the slope and work up excavated material should be spread evenly along the uphill slope and compacted using hand tamping or other methods  construct trenches at contour intervals of 3 to 30 feet apart depending on the steepness of the slope soil type and rainfall the steeper the slope the closer together the trenches  install the wattles snugly into the trenches and abut tightly end to end do not overlap the ends  install stakes at each end of the wattle and at 4foot centers along entire length of wattle  if required install pilot holes for the stakes using a straight bar to drive holes wattle and into the soil  at a minimum wooden stakes should be approximately 34  34  24 inches willow cuttings or 38 inch rebar can also be used for stakes  stakes should be driven middle of the wattle leaving 2 to 3 inches of the stake protruding above the wattle maintenance standards  inspect bmps prior to forecast rain daily during extended rain events after rain events weekly during the rainy season and at twoweek intervals during the nonrainy season  wattles may require maintenance to ensure they are in contact with soil and thoroughly entrenched especially after significant rainfall on steep sandy soils  inspect the slope after significant storms and repair any areas where wattles are not tightly abutted or water has scoured beneath the wattles figure sc131 straw wattles from stormwater management manual for western washington washington department of ecology 2001 14 bmp sc14 sediment trap purpose a sediment trap is a small temporary ponding area with a gravel outlet used to collect and store sediment from sites cleared andor graded during construction sediment traps along with other perimeter controls shall be installed before any land disturbance takes place in the drainage area conditions of use prior to leaving a construction site stormwater runoff must pass sediment pond or trap or other appropriate sediment removal best management practice nonengineered sediment traps may be used onsite prior to an engineered sediment trap or sediment pond to provide additional sediment removal capacity it is intended for use on sites where the tributary drainage area is less than 3 acres with no unusual drainage features and a projected buildout time of six months or less the sediment trap is a temporary measure with a design life of approximately 6 months and shall be maintained until the site area is permanently protected against erosion by vegetation andor structures sediment traps and ponds are only effective in removing sediment down to about the medium silt size fraction runoff with sediment of finer grades fine silt and clay will pass emphasizing the need to control erosion to the maximum extent first whenever possible sedimentladen water shall be discharged into onsite relatively level vegetated areas see bmp sc6  filter strip this is the only way to effectively remove fine particles from runoff unless chemical treatment or filtration is used this can be particularly useful after initial treatment in a sediment trap or pond the areas of release must be evaluated on a sitebysite basis in order to determine appropriate locations for and methods of releasing runoff vegetated wetlands shall not be used for this purpose frequently it may be possible to pump water from the collection point at the downhill end of the site to an upslope vegetated area pumping shall only augment the treatment system not replace it because of the possibility of pump failure or runoff volume in excess of pump capacity all projects that are constructing permanent facilities for runoff quantity control should use the roughgraded or finalgraded permanent facilities for traps and ponds this includes combined facilities and infiltration facilities when permanent facilities are used as temporary sedimentation facilities the surface area requirement of a sediment trap or pond must be met if the surface area requirements are larger than the surface area of the permanent facility then the trap or pond shall be enlarged to comply with the surface area requirement the permanent pond shall also be divided into two cells as required for sediment ponds if permanent infiltration facilities are used for temporary sediment traps the bottom of the trap must be kept at least two feet higher that the bottom elevation of the permanent facility this will provide a vertical buffer to prevent sediment from plugging the native soils to be used for permanent infiltration the permanent facility will be excavated to final depth once the site has been stabilized and the temporary trap is no longer necessary either a permanent control structure or the temporary control structure described in bmp sc15 temporary sediment pond can be used if a permanent control structure is used it may be advisable to partially restrict the lower orifice with gravel to increase residence time while still allowing dewatering of the pond a shutoff valve may be added to the control structure to allow complete retention of stormwater in emergency situations in this case an emergency overflow weir must be added a skimmer may be used for the sediment trap outlet if approved by carson city design and installation specifications  see figures sc141 and sc142 for details  if permanent runoff control facilities are part of the project they should be used for sediment retention  to determine the sediment trap geometry first calculate the design surface area sa of the trap measured at the invert of the weir use the following equation sa   fsq 2 vs where q 2   design inflow based on the peak discharge from the developed 2year 24 hour runoff event from the contributing drainage area as computed in the hydrologic analysis the 10year peak flow shall be used if the project size expected timing and duration of construction or downstream conditions warrant a higher level of protection if no hydrologic analysis is required the rational method may be used vs   the settling velocity of the soil particle of interest the 002 mm medium silt particle with an assumed density of 265 gcm3 has been selected as the particle of interest and has a settling velocity vs of  feet sec fs   a safety factor of 2 to account for nonideal settling therefore the equation for computing surface area becomes sa   2  q 2   or 2080 square feet per cfs of inflow note even if permanent facilities are used they must still have a surface area that is at least as large as that derived from the above formula if they do not the pond must be enlarged  to aid in determining sediment depth all sediment traps shall have a staff gauge with a prominent mark 1foot above the bottom of the trap  sediment traps may not be feasible on utility projects due to the limited workspace or the shortterm nature of the work portable tanks may be used in place of sediment traps for utility projects maintenance standards  inspect bmps prior to forecast rain daily during extended rain events after rain events weekly during the rainy season and at 2week intervals during the nonrainy season  sediment shall be removed from the trap when it reaches 1foot in depth  any damage to the pond embankments or slopes shall be repaired figure sc141 crosssediment trap from stormwater management manual for western washington washington department of ecology 2001 figure sc142 sediment trap outlet from stormwater management manual for western washington washington department of ecology 2001 15 bmp sc15 temporary sediment pond purpose sediment ponds remove sediment from runoff originating from disturbed areas of the site sediment ponds are typically designed to remove sediment no smaller than medium silt 002 mm consequently they usually reduce turbidity only slightly conditions of use  prior to leaving a construction site stormwater runoff must pass sediment pond or other appropriate sediment removal best management practice  a sediment pond shall be used where the contributing drainage area is 3 acres or more ponds must be used in conjunction with erosion control practices to reduce the amount of sediment flowing into the basin design and installation specifications  sediment basins must be installed only on sites where failure of the structure would not result in loss of life damage to homes or buildings or interruption of use or service of public roads or utilities also sediment traps and ponds are attractive to children and can be very dangerous compliance with local ordinances regarding health and safety must be addressed if fencing of the pond is required the type of fence and its location shall be shown on the esc plan  structures having a maximum height of 20 feet andor a maximum storage capacity of 20 acrefeet or larger are subject to dam safety regulations smaller impoundments may also be subject to dam safety regulations if they are determined to be highhazard based on potential downstream impacts as determined by the nevada department of water resources  see figure sc151 figure sc152 and figure sc153 for details  if permanent runoff control facilities are part of the project they should be used for sediment retention the surface area requirements of the sediment basin must be met this may require enlarging the permanent basin to comply with the surface area requirements if a permanent control structure is used it may be advisable to partially restrict the lower orifice with gravel to increase residence time while still allowing dewatering of the basin  use of infiltration facilities for sedimentation basins during construction tends to clog the soils and reduce their capacity to infiltrate if infiltration facilities are to be used the sides and bottom of the facility must only be rough excavated to a minimum of 2 feet above final grade final grading of the infiltration facility shall occur only when all contributing drainage areas are fully stabilized the infiltration pretreatment facility should be fully constructed and used with the sedimentation basin to help prevent clogging  determining pond geometry  obtain the discharge from the hydrologic calculations of the peak flow for the 2year 24 hour runoff event  q 2  the 10year peak flow shall be used if the project size expected timing and duration of construction or downstream conditions warrant a higher level of protection if no hydrologic analysis is required the rational method may be used determine the required surface area at the top of the riser pipe with the equation  to determine the sediment trap geometry first calculate the design surface area  sa  of the trap measured at the invert of the weir use the following equation sa   fsq 2 vs where q 2   design inflow based on the peak discharge from the developed 2year 24 hour runoff event from the contributing drainage area as computed in the hydrologic analysis the 10year peak flow

inflow note even if permanent facilities are used they must still have a surface area that is at least as large as that derived from the above formula if they do not the pond must be enlarged the basic geometry of the pond can now be determined using the following design criteria  required surface area sa from above at top of riser  minimum 35foot depth from top of riser to bottom of pond  maximum  interior side slopes and maximum  exterior slopes the interior slopes can be increased to a maximum of  if 6 foot high chainlink fencing is provided at or above the maximum water surface  one foot of freeboard between the top of the riser and the crest of the emergency spillway  flat bottom  minimum 1foot deep spillway  lengthtowidth ratio between  and   sizing of discharge mechanisms the outlet for the basin consists of a combination of principal and emergency spillways these outlets must pass the peak runoff expected from the contributing drainage area for a 100year storm 24 hour design if due to site conditions and basin geometry a separate emergency spillway is not feasible the principal spillway must pass the entire peak runoff expected from the 100year storm however an attempt to provide a separate emergency spillway should always be made the runoff calculations should be based on the site conditions producing the maximum amount of runoff which is typically the developed paved condition but could also be the rough graded condition if the developed site incorporates significant landscaping the flow dewatering orifice cannot be utilized when calculating the 100year storm elevation because of its potential to become clogged  therefore available spillway storage must begin at the principal spillway riser crest the principal spillway designed by the procedures contained in this standard will result in some reduction in the peak rate of runoff however if the basin for a permanent stormwater detention pond is used for a temporary sedimentation basin the control structure for the permanent pond can be used to maintain predevelopment discharge limitations the size of the basin the expected life of the construction project the anticipated downstream effects and the anticipated weather conditions during construction should be considered to determine the need of additional discharge control see figure sc154 for riser inflow curves principal spillway determine the required diameter for the principal spillway riser pipe the diameter shall be the minimum necessary to pass the predeveloped 10year 24 hour peak flow q 10  use figure

feetsecond2 convert the required orifice area to the required diameter d of the orifice where d   orifice diameter inches the vertical perforated tubing connected to the dewatering orifice must be at least 2 inches larger in diameter than the orifice to improve flow characteristics the size and number of perforations in the tubing should be large enough so that the tubing does not restrict flow the orifice should control the flow rate  additional design specifications the pond shall be divided into two roughly equal volume cells by a permeable divider that will reduce turbulence while allowing movement of water between cells the divider shall be at least one half the height of the riser and a minimum of one foot below the top of the riser wirebacked 2 to 3foot high extra strength filter fabric supported by treated 4x4s can be used as a divider alternatively staked straw bales wrapped with filter fabric geotextile may be used if the pond is more than 6 feet deep a different mechanism must be proposed a riprap embankment is one acceptable method of separation for deeper ponds other designs that satisfy the intent of this provision are allowed as long as the divider is permeable structurally sound and designed to prevent erosion under or around the barrier to aid in determining sediment depth onefoot intervals shall be prominently marked on the riser if an embankment of more than 6 feet is proposed the pond must comply with dam safety regulations per nevada department of water resources and must be designed based on recommendation from a qualified geotechnical engineer  the most common structural failure of sedimentation basins is caused by piping piping refers to two phenomena 1 water seeping grained soil eroding the soil grain by grain and forming pipes or tunnels  and 2 water under pressure flowing upward granular soil with a head of sufficient magnitude to cause soil grains to lose contact and capability for support the most critical construction sequences to prevent piping will be 1 tight connections between riser and barrel and other pipe connections  2 adequate anchoring of riser  3 proper soil compaction of the embankment and riser footing  4 proper construction of antiseep devices maintenance standards  inspect bmps prior to forecast rain daily during extended rain events after rain events weekly during the rainy season

sediment from runoff originating from disturbed areas of the site conditions of use traditional bmps used to control soil erosion and sediment loss from sites under development may not be adequate to ensure compliance with the water quality standard for turbidity in the receiving water filtration may be used in conjunction with gravity settling to remove sediment as small as fine silt 05 m the reduction in turbidity will be dependent on the particle size distribution of the sediment in the stormwater in some circumstances sedimentation and filtration may achieve compliance with the water quality standard for turbidity filtration may also be used in conjunction with polymer treatment in a portable system to assure capture of the flocculated solids design and installation specifications background information filtration with sand media has been used for over a century to treat water and wastewater the use of sand filtration for treatment of stormwater has developed recently generally to treat runoff from streets parking lots and residential areas the application of filtration to construction stormwater treatment is currently under development 2 types of filtration systems may be applied to construction stormwater treatment rapid and slow rapid sand filters are the typical system used for water and wastewater treatment they can achieve relatively high hydraulic flow rates on the order of 2 to 20 gpmsquare feet because they have automatic backwash systems to remove accumulated solids in contrast slow sand filters have very low hydraulic rates on the order of 002 gpmsquare feet because they do not have backwash systems to date slow sand filtration has generally been used to treat stormwater slow sand filtration is mechanically simple in comparison to rapid sand filtration but requires a much larger filter area filtration equipment sand media filters are available with automatic backwashing features that can filter to 50 m particle size screen or bag filters can filter down to 5 m fiber wound filters can remove particles down to 05 m filters should be sequenced from the largest to the smallest pore opening sediment removal efficiency will be related to particle size distribution in the stormwater treatment process description stormwater is collected at interception points on the site and is diverted to a sediment pond or tank for removal of large sediment and storage of the stormwater before it is treated by the filtration system the stormwater is pumped from the trap pond or tank filtration system in a rapid sand filtration system slow sand filtration systems are designed as flow using gravity if large volumes of concrete are being poured ph adjustment may be necessary maintenance standards  rapid sand filters typically have automatic backwash systems that are triggered by a preset pressure drop across the filter if the backwash water volume is not large or substantially more turbid than the stormwater stored in the holding pond or tank backwash return to the pond or tank may be appropriate however land application or another means of treatment and disposal may be necessary  screen bag and fiber filters must be cleaned andor replaced when they become clogged  sediment shall be removed from the storage andor treatment ponds as necessary typically sediment removal is required once or twice during a wet season and at the decommissioning of the ponds c management source control bmps 1 bmp mc1 concrete handling purpose concrete work can generate process water and slurry that contain fine particles and high ph both of

drainage plans shall be consistent with and integrated with the carson city drainage master plan upon adoption this characteristic of drainage requires coordination and cooperation from both the public and private sectors storm water drainage systems are an integral part of the development process the planning of drainage facilities shall be included in the development process and in preparation of improvement plans drainage systems require space to accommodate conveyance and storage functions when the space requirements are considered the provision for adequate drainage becomes a competing use for space along with other land uses storm drainage planning for all development shall include the allocation of space for drainage facility construction and maintenance which may entail the dedication of rightofway andor easements the provision of multiuse facilities such as combining with parks open space and recreation needs is strongly encouraged  water rights all drainage systems shall be planned and constructed with consideration given to the existing water rights and applicable water laws  reasonable use of drainage downstream properties shall not be unreasonably burdened with increased flow rates negative impacts or unreasonable changes in manner of flow from upstream properties drainage problems shall not be transferred from one location to another however downstream properties cannot block natural or existing runoff site and shall accept runoff from upstream properties reasonable use of drainage is defined for planning purposes as providing an economic and hydraulically efficient drainage system which is demonstrated not to adversely and unreasonably impact downstream properties within reason this reasonable use of drainage therefore allows development to occur while preserving the rights of adjacent property owners  change in manner of flow development shall tend to concentrate existing natural sheet flow into point flows at property lines these point flows are generally associated with outlets from gutter flow storm drains and detention facilities downstream properties may experience a longer duration of storm flows and greater flows in general due to a shortened time of concentration discharge of point flows on downstream property can cause increased erosion at the discharge point and further downstream therefore downstream facilities shall be evaluated for runoff capacity during the design and review process mitigation of these point flows can be accomplished dissipaters or flow spreaders point flows shall be discharged to downstream properties at nonerosive velocities and depths of flow  diversion of drainage development can alter the historic or natural drainage paths when these alterations result in a local onsite drainage system that discharges back into the natural drainageway or wash at or near the historic location then the alterations interbasin transfer are generally acceptable however when flows from the local onsite drainage system do not return to the historic drainageway or wash then interbasin transfer may result these interbasin transfers are generally not acceptable planning and design of drainage systems shall not be based on the premise that storm water can be transferred from one basin to another unless part of an adopted city regional drainage system plan the flow of storm runoff shall be maintained within its natural drainage course unless reasonable use is demonstrated otherwise when storm water is discharged into an existing drainage course the peak discharge into the water course shall not adversely affect or cause damage to property along the drainage course now or in the future based on existing zoning and the carson city master plan buildout conditions erosional

requirements storage also provides for sediment and debris collection which reduces maintenance requirements for downstream channels and streams local detention storage for land development which includes subdividing land shall be required when the development increases flows and downstream conveyance capacities of the drainage system are not capable of handling nondetained flows and the
