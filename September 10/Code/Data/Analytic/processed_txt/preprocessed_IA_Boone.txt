bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required under subsection

be totally under city control 3 detention requirements the required volume of storm water detention shall be that necessary to handle the runoff of a 100year rainfall for any and all durations from the drainage area tributary to the storm water storage area based on full development of said tributary area less the volume discharge during the same duration at the approved release rate the storm water release rate shall be considered when calculating the storm water storage capacity and the control structure shall be designed to maintain a relatively uniform rate regardless of the depth of storm water in the storm area thus the required detention storage rds will be that found to be the most critical resulting from the inflow from the runoff of a fully developed tributary area from a 100year storm and outflow of the fiveyear storm with the same area in its urbanized or natural state totally grassed also see subsection 2 above detention storage may be provided as a dry bottom or

facilities shall be designed and constructed to fully protect the public health safety and welfare existing downstream hazards garages houses must be considered storm water runoff velocities shall be

and alley prow is owned or controlled by the city primarily for the purpose of pedestrian and vehicular passage and for the citys provision of essential public safety services including police fire and emergency medical response services and public health services including sanitary sewer water and storm drainage services  all other purposes are deemed subservient 2 in order to provide for the health safety and wellbeing of its citizens as well as to insure the structural integrity of its streets and other infrastructure the city strives to keep its prow in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances  although the general population bears the financial burden for the upkeep of the prow a primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of streets and other city infrastructure is frequent excavation of the prow by persons whose equipment is located therein 3 the city recognizes that it holds prow within its geographical boundaries as an asset in trust for its citizens  the city and other public entities have invested substantial public funds to acquire build and maintain prow and city infrastructure located therein  the city also recognizes that some persons by placing their equipment in the prow and charging certain city residents and some nonresidents for goods and services delivered thereby are burdening for private gain this property held by the city for the public good  although such services are often necessary or convenient for various groups of resident and nonresident customers such persons receive revenue andor profit as a consequence of this burden on prow 4 the demands upon city prow space are virtually unlimited but the space itself is finite  burdens on city prow will only increase as competition for retail utility customers grows providers multiply and new technologies are developed and installed 5 as city prow space is consumed acquisition of new prow has to be anticipated and provision has to be made for funding such acquisition in a manner that spreads the costs as fairly among current and future registrants as is reasonably practicable 6 the city is obliged to devote substantial city staff and resources to balancing and reconciling competing infrastructure needs with the fundamental governmental function of maintaining regular and convenient public access to safe and structurally sound city streets and other city facilities 7 the cost of restoration efforts that are abandoned or insufficiently performed by prow registrants has to be recovered 8 each intrusion into the citys prow can damage and shorten the useful life of overlying streets alleys sidewalks and other city facilities to the detriment of city residents who are not necessarily customers or beneficiaries of the entity causing the particular intrusion 9 a responsible city program of prow management should seek to recover the citys costs associated with prow restoration administration and consumptionacquisition hereinafter collectively called prow management program costs from franchised and franchiseable utilities nonfranchiseable telephone utilities including but not limited to municipal telephone utilities and other private prow occupiers 10 franchised utilities that pay franchise fees already contribute to the citys prow management program costs 11 burdens on and consumption of prow by municipal utilities and departments of the city constitute the citys management of its own property 12 prow management program costs attributable to prow intrusions accomplished by franchised or franchiseable utilities that do not pay franchise fees nonfranchiseable telephone utilities including but not limited to municipal telephone utilities and other private prow occupiers should be recovered from the entity causing each intrusion and their customers and should not fall generally upon city taxpayers as a whole 13 the purposes of this chapter are a with respect to franchised utilities that pay franchise fees to ratify and confirm existing franchise agreements and franchise fees and to clarify their regulatory obligations consistent with and to the extent that such matters are not addressed by existing franchise agreements b with respect to franchised or franchiseable utilities that do not pay franchise fees nonfranchiseable telephone utilities including but not limited to municipal telephone utilities and other private prow occupiers to confirm city authority to regulate their activity relative to city prow to specify procedures for their application for city permission to locate and operate facilities in city prow to identify and quantify all costs of the citys prow management and to provide for the recovery of all such costs specifically from the entity causing each intrusion or their customers so that such costs do not fall generally upon city taxpayers as a whole c to ensure that all users of the prow are subject to the same provisions and fees the provisions of this chapter shall be applied in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory manner 15502 applicability of chapter 1 all existing franchise agreements and fees in existence as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter are hereby ratified and confirmed 2 franchised utilities that pay a franchise fee are subject to all regulatory provisions of this chapter to the extent that such provisions are in addition to and not in conflict with existing franchise agreements  applicable fees shall be waived in recognition of the payment of the franchise fees 3
