warren ohio  part one administrative three  traffic five  general offenses seven  business regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention seventeenhealth s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or

standards for monitoring and assessing inflow and infiltration in all areas of the city of warren and satellite systems this component of the program should determine the amount of inflow and infiltration that is currently entering the citys sanitary sewer system this monitoring component should provide the information needed to assess where inflow and infiltration concerns may exist 2implementation of inflow and infiltration reduction pilot projects utilizing various technologies and subsequent flow monitoring to determine the effectiveness of the pilot project once high inflow and infiltration flow areas are identified small scale rehabilitation and mitigation projects can be identified and implemented if successful these pilot projects could then be rolled out across the system where warranted 3a costbenefit analysis to determine best applications for inflow and infiltration reduction results from the pilot projects in conjunction with a thorough understanding of deficient areas should form the basis for cost analysis to determine the extent and expected benefits of expanding the pilot projects to full scale rehabilitation projects 4projects implemented that demonstrate the removal of inflow and infiltration projects can include grouting sliplining spot repair sewer line replacement downspout eliminations footer drain elimination and other approved best management practices projects must demonstrate successful inflow and infiltration reduction to qualify for surcharge credits demonstration will be accomplished by flow monitoring downstream of the area to be repaired in dry and wet weather conditions prior to the repair occurring thereby establishing a baseline flow after the repair occurs additional downstream flow monitoring will be accomplished wetdry weather to determine the success of the repair a reduction of flow from the documented baseline flow will allow for surcharge credit 10 passed 12710 93506 storm water drainage fee
