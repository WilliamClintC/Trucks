standards and objectives a purpose the purpose of this section is to regulate the intensity of use in areas of steeply sloping terrain in order to limit soil loss erosion excessive stormwater runoff the degradation of surface water and to maintain the natural topography and drainage patterns of land b background disturbance of steep slopes results in accelerated erosion processes from stormwater runoff and the subsequent sedimentation of waterbodies with the associated degradation of water quality and loss of aquatic life support related effects include soil loss changes in natural topography and drainage patterns increased flooding potential further fragmentation of forest and habitat areas and compromised aesthetic values it has become widely recognized that disturbance of steep slopes should be restricted or prevented based on the impact disturbance of steep slopes can have on water quality and quantity and the environmental integrity of landscapes 106 editors note this section

the slope the percent of slope shall be calculated for each twofoot contour interval for example any location on the site where there is a onefoot rise over a tenfoot horizontal run constitutes a tenpercent slope  a oneandonehalffoot rise over a tenfoot horizontal run constitutes a fifteenpercent slope  a twofoot rise over a tenfoot horizontal run constitutes a twentypercent slope f steep slope limits 1 for steep slopes any disturbance shall be prohibited except as provided below a redevelopment within the limits of existing impervious surfaces  and b new disturbance necessary to protect public health safety or welfare such as necessary linear development with no feasible alternative  to provide an environmental benefit such as remediation of a contaminated site  to prevent extraordinary hardship on the property owner peculiar to the property  or to prevent extraordinary hardship provided the hardship was not created by the property owner that would not permit a minimum
