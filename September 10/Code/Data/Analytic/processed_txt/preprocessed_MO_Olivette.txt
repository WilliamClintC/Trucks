comply with stormwater permit requirements for the st louis metropolitan small municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 to meet the national pollution discharge city code elimination system permit system required under the clean water act phase ii stormwater regulations the purpose of the swmp is to prevent harmful pollutants from being carried by stormwater runoff into local water bodies and to improve the water quality in the area stormwater  rainfall or other forms of precipitation stormwater runoff is the result of stormwater washing across impervious surfaces carrying with it the pollutants found on streets parking lots rooftops etc these pollutants end up in watersheds stream buffer protection ordinance  of the olivette municipal creates buffer zones along the streams of

stormwater regulations established under state law and approval or exemption from these requirements does not constitute approval or exemption from stormwater management regulations established under

certification issued by the missouri department of natural resources a purpose and objective the city of olivette recognizes that redevelopment of property either in the form of expansion or new construction in a developed community is unique and challenging as it relates to managing stormwater given that redevelopment in olivette whether residential or nonresidential occurs on a lot by lot basis addressing stormwater issues that go beyond the scope of the property being developed is limited city code in an effort to adequately plan for and resolve stormwater issues on a citywide basis as individual lots redevelop the adoption of the following underlying principles are intended to provide the city guidance during the review of site alterations these principles will be applied so as to manage stormwater on two 2 levels a the stormwater impacting the property under review from adjacent and surrounding properties and b the impacts of the stormwater generated by the existing and proposed improvements on the property grounds under review onto adjacent and surrounding properties these principles and acceptable practices will be utilized by the city to manage stormwater generated on a site due to new construction or reconstruction and to minimize the adverse impact of any increase of stormwater onto adjacent and surrounding properties these principles and acceptable practices are to manage stormwater and should not be construed as a means for reducing or eliminating stormwater that is already generated on or surrounding the site b principles 1 applications for site alterations approvals shall be designed and reviewed in accordance to the following acceptable principles a encourage the reduction of 1 disturbance to preserved greenspace buffers zoning setbacks and sensitive areas such as flood plains and stream buffers  2 impervious surface areas such as rooftops parking lots sidewalks roads etc  3 stormwater generation and the amount of stormwater leaving the site  4 the impact to environmentally sensitive areas  and b minimize 1 erosion of site soils  2 stream bank erosion  3 downstream flooding c promote the use of pervious surface materials such as permeable paver blocks porous asphalt porous concrete and green roofs d encourage the stormwater generated on the site grounds to filter disperse and permeate on the site grounds ordinance use of overland flow to vegetated buffers and other green infrastructure techniques that promote infiltration e avoid the direct flow of stormwater generated from impervious surface areas to the storm sewer system f encourage the installation of engineered systems that treat stormwater runoff andor reduce peak stormwater runoff rates using techniques that employ vegetation and infiltration g adequately treat stormwater before discharge h stormwater controls shall be maintainable and enforceable 2 acceptable practices to promote the adopted principles the city of olivette has adopted the following two 2 documents developed by the msd as reference resources for acceptable practices and tools to manage stormwater as may be revised from time to time a site guidance design tools for incorporating postconstruction stormwater quality protection into concept plans and land disturbance permitting revision 1  b landscape guide for stormwater bmps design copies of the adopted documents

commission and that the commission determines that said practice will equally facilitate the principles and practices outlined in olivette city code article iv review and approval stormwater

stormwater management impacts of proposed site alterations upon the surrounding uses activities properties the existing stormwater infrastructure and the watershed and that the site alterations adhere to the principles and acceptable practices outlined in the concept stormwater management plan shall illustrate how the proposed site alternations will a preserve andor protect existing natural resources areas that facilitate pollutant removal and reduce runoff b limit disturbance and preserve existing pervious surface areas and sensitive areas such as flood plains and stream buffers c reduce the amount of impervious surface area ie rooftops parking lots sidewalks roads etc d disconnect the stormwater flow generated from impervious surface areas from the msd built stormwater infrastructure system and utilize overland flow to vegetated buffers and other green infrastructure techniques that promote infiltration e use pervious surface materials such as permeable paver blocks

design consistent with the olivette strategic plan and standards of the city of olivette b it is the purpose of this to establish design parameters to ensure buildings along the olive boulevard corridor are respectful complementary and avoid the overshadow existing developments in the immediate area this not intended to place limitations on a ordinance buildings size mass or height in

changes windows canopies arcades eaves and other decorative features that enhance the buildings appearance a flat unarticulated wall with just windows and doors serving as voids is unacceptable 1 the following design principles shall be used to evaluate appropriate variations in the building plane a in no case shall a plane on any building elevation contain an unarticulated wall or flat building plane in excess of twentyfive 25 feet in length without an acceptable interruption in the building plane acceptable interruptions in a building plane can include a covered pedestrian entry a canopy or an arcade that is ten 10 feet in depth or pilasters piers or building projections no less than three 3 feet in depth b heights of structures should relate to adjacent open spaces to allow maximum sun and ventilation protection from prevailing winds enhance public views of surroundings and minimize obstruction of view from adjoining structures c height and scale of new development should recognize the mass and scale of surrounding developments by providing architectural elements that provide for a transition from the height of adjacent development to the maximum height of the proposed structure d to reduce the appearance of large scale bulky structures large buildings which give the appearance of boxlike structures should 1 vary the planes of the exterior walls in depth andor direction wall planes should not run in one 1 continuous city code direction for more than twentyfive 25 feet without an offset  2 vary the height of the building so that it appears to be divided into distinct massing elements  3 articulate the different parts of a buildings facade by use of color arrangement of facade elements or a change in materials  4 use landscaping and architectural detailing at the ground level to lessen the impact of an otherwise bulky building  and 5 all structure elevations should be architecturally treated e scale for purposes here is the relationship between the size of the new structure and the size of adjoining permanent structures it is also how the proposed buildings size relates to the size of a human being human scale large scale building elements will appear imposing if they are situated in a visual environment which is predominantly smaller in scale 1 building scale can be reduced proper use of window patterns structural bays roof overhangs siding awnings moldings fixtures and other details 2 the scale of buildings should be carefully related to adjacent pedestrian areas ie plazas courtyards and other structures 3 large dominating structures should be broken up by a creating horizontal emphasis use of trim  b adding awnings eaves windows or other architectural ornamentation  c use of combinations of exterior materials and comparable colors  and d landscape materials ordinance figure 3a the following figure provides an illustration of acceptable masses and voids along each building elevation figure 3b the following figure provides
