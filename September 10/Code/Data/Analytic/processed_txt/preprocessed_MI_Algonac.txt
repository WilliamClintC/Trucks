more desirable living environment by preserving the natural character of open fields stands of trees brooks hills and similar natural assets 2 encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the development of residential areas 3 encourage a more efficient aesthetic and desirable use of open area while recognizing a reduction in development costs and allowing the developer to bypass natural obstacles on the site 4 encourage the provision of open space within reasonable distance to all lot development of the subdivision and to further encourage the development of recreational facilities b modification to the standards outlined in this article may be made in the one and twofamily residential districts when the following conditions are met 1 the lot area in all one and twofamily residential districts which are served by a public sanitary sewer system may be reduced up to 20 percent in the r1 district this reduction may be accomplished in part by reducing lot widths

clustering or attaching of buildings on parcels of land under single ownership and control which in the opinion of the planning commission have characteristics which would make sound physical development under the normal subdivision approach impractical because of parcel size shape or dimension or because of soil problems or similar natural condition in approving an area for cluster development at the densities permitted in subsection 4 of this section the planning commission shall find at least one of the following conditions to exist a the parcel to be developed is generally parallel to and generally does not exceed 500 feet in depth on those unsubdivided parcels of land abutting at major or collector thoroughfare of at least 86 feet of rightofway width so as to provide transition between such major thoroughfare and adjacent singlefamily detached housing b a parcel of land located between developed singlefamily detached uses in which the size shape and location of the parcel preclude a development of singlefamily detached units for subdivision in a proper manner  the determination shall be made by the planning commission c a small parcel which is shaped such that it contains acute angles which would make a normal subdivision difficult to achieve and has frontage on a major thoroughfare or collector street d a substantial part of the parcels perimeter is bordered by a major or collector thoroughfare which would result in a substantial proportion of the lots of the development abutting the major thoroughfare or collector street e the parcel contains a floodplain or poor soil condition which results in a substantial portion of the total area of the parcel being unbuildable soil test borings floodplain maps or other documented evidence must be submitted to the planning commission in order to substantiate the parcels qualification for cluster development f the parcel contains natural assets which could be preserved use of cluster development such assets may include natural stands of large trees lands which serve as a natural habitat for wildlife unusual topographic features or other natural assets which in the opinion of the planning commission should be preserved requests for qualification under these conditions must be supported by documented evidence which indicates that the natural assets would qualify the parcel under this option 6 the area in open space accomplished use of onefamily clusters shall represent at least 15 percent of the horizontal development area of a onefamily cluster development 7 in order to provide an orderly transition where the project proposed for use as a cluster development abuts a one and twofamily residential district the planning commission shall determine that the abutting one and

that any proposed development thereafter shall be reviewed and approved by the planning commission any proposed change in site plan or building after approval has been received shall require review and approval by the planning commission prior to effecting said change 11 application of this option shall only be permitted when the site plan has been reviewed and approved by the planning
