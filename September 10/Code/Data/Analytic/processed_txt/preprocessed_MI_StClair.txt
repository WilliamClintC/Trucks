and benefits of charges rates and fees the city council has previously found and further currently reaffirms that the fairest and most reasonable method of providing for the operation maintenance

for improvements and replacements to the system  2 ongoing repair replacement and improvement and budgeted as part of the annual costs of the system  and 3 operation administration and maintenance costs of the system the city has investigated several methods of apportioning the costs of the water service provided by the system based on its investigation and on the advice of its engineers the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that to ensure the stability and viability of the system for the benefit of its users the fairest and most accurate way to apportion the costs of operation maintenance replacement and improvement of the system is to charge each user i a connection fee and a capital charge for water service when such users property is first connected to the system  ii a commodity rate for the use of water  iii a readinesstoserve charge  and iv other charges and costs for services which are equivalent to the cost of providing such services the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the rates and charges currently in effect accurately apportion the fixed and variable costs of the system among the users of the system and that the commodity rate and the readinesstoserve charges each provide actual benefits to such users in the form of ready access to water service that would be unavailable if such charges were not charged in addition to the findings set forth above the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the capital charge reflects the depreciated capital costs of the system previously paid by the city and the system less grants attributable to each new user and that the opportunity to connect to the system provides actual benefits to each new user equal to or greater than the amount of such charges furthermore the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the charges imposed by the system are sufficient to meet the shortterm capital improvement needs of the system g design life of improvements based on the advice of its engineers the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that any improvements to or capital

article iii  sewer service legislative findings and purpose a public sanitary sewer systems essential public sanitary sewer systems are essential to the health safety and welfare of the people of the state and the city septic tank disposal systems are subject to failure due to soil conditions or other reasons failure or potential failure of septic tank disposal systems poses a threat to the public health safety and welfare presents a potential for ill health transmission of disease mortality and potential economic blight and constitutes a threat to the quality of surface and subsurface waters of the state and the city b connection to system essential for public health safety and welfare the connection to available public sanitary sewer systems at the earliest reasonable date is a matter for the protection of the public health safety and welfare and necessary in the public interest which is declared as a matter of legislative determination c purpose of article the purpose of this article is to provide for the minimum standards of materials and workmanship the inspection by the city and the use of the connection to the available public sanitary sewer system for the protection of the public health and welfare d necessity for sewage disposal the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the use of septic tanks privies privy vaults cesspools or similar private sewage disposal facilities may be deleterious to the health safety and welfare of the businesses industries governmental and charitable agencies and residents of the city and that the health safety and welfare of the businesses industries governmental and charitable agencies and residents is enhanced by the creation of a public sewer system and wastewater treatment plant with regulation by the city of pollutants and other harmful materials according to state and federal standards e method for measuring usesewage disposal services based on advice of its engineers the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the most practical cost effective and accurate method given available technology of measuring the use of the systems sewers by any user is by the meter or meters used to measure water usage f continuation of service the city council has previously found and further currently reaffirms that in order to provide and continue to provide for the safe and uninterrupted removal and treatment of sewage pollutants and other harmful materials it is necessary from time to time to install improvement enlargements extensions and repairs to the systems sewers and sewer service pipes g purpose of charges the charges and fees for the use of and connection to the system are hereby established for the purpose of recovering the cost of acquisition construction reconstruction maintenance repair and operation of the system and to comply with federal and state safe drinking water acts and related regulations to provide for the payment of principal of and interest on any bonds authorized to be issued as and when the same become due and payable to create a bond and interest redemption fund therefor to provide a fund for reasonable and necessary

made in accordance with the purposes herein described as well as the following 1 all premises connected directly or indirectly to the system except as hereinafter provided shall be charged and shall make payments to the city in amounts computed on the basis of this chapter 2 the charges rates and fees for sewer service by the system are established herein to adequately provide for bond requirements and to ensure that the system does not operate at a deficit 3 the system staff or designated parties shall periodically review the charges rates fees rules and regulations of the system which review shall be completed not less than one time per fiscal year results of the review shall be reported to the city council with recommendations for any adjustments 4 the charges rates and fees shall be set so as to recover costs from users in reasonable proportion to the cost of serving those users h proportionality fairness and benefits of charges rates and fees the city council has previously found and further currently reaffirms that the fairest and most reasonable method of providing for the operation maintenance repair replacement and improvement of the system is to charge each user based in all cases on amount of use for the costs of 1 retiring debt secured by the net revenues of the system issued to pay for improvements and replacements to the system  2 ongoing repair replacement and improvement and budgeted as part of the annual costs of the system  and 3 operation administration and maintenance costs of the system the city has investigated several methods of apportioning the costs of the sewer disposal service provided by the system based on its investigation and on the advice of its engineers the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that to ensure the stability and viability of the system for the benefit of its users the fairest and most accurate way to apportion the costs of operation maintenance replacement and improvement of the system is to charge each user i a connection fee and a capital charge for sewer service when such users property is first connected to the system  ii a commodity rate for the use of sewer services  iii a readinesstoserve charge  and iv other charges and costs for services which are equivalent to the cost of providing such services the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the rates and charges currently in effect accurately apportion the fixed and variable costs of the system among the users of the system and that the commodity rate and the readinesstoserve charges each provide actual benefits to such users in the form of ready access to sewer service that would be unavailable if such charges were not charged in addition to the findings set forth above the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the capital charge reflects the depreciated capital costs of the system previously paid by the city and the system less grants attributable to each new user and that the opportunity to connect to the system provides actual benefits to each new user equal to or greater than the amount of such charges furthermore the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the charges imposed by the system are sufficient to meet the shortterm capital improvement needs of the system i design life of improvements based on the advice of its engineers the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that any improvements to or capital expenditures for the system paid for by rates and charges did not at the time such improvements were constructed and financed have an expected design life that would exceed the term of the respective bonds issued to finance such improvements or capital expenditures j charges for nonresidents 1 contracts for sewer disposal services the city has previously entered and may continue to enter into contracts with municipalities adjacent to the city to provide sewage disposal services to users of the water supply system located in those municipalities rates and charges billed for use by the residents of those municipalities shall be in accordance with the applicable contract 2 charges for service to customers outside city where no other contract compensates the city for indirect costs the city has previously found and hereby ratifies and confirms that the total direct and indirect costs of providing sewer disposal service to customers outside the city jurisdiction where no other contract exists with the governmental units where those customers are located equals at least two times the rates and charges imposed for direct services and debt service cost to customers located in the city indirect costs include payment for capital improvements extraordinary repairs and replacements for the sewage disposal system benefitting all users of the system and paid for by customers served within the corporate limits of the city or the corporate limits of other municipalities which have entered into contracts with the city for such costs funding depreciation of the improvements to the sewage disposal system and fire and police or other

 12213 bioretention a bioretention system consists of a soil bed planted with native vegetation located above an underdrained sand layer it can be configured as either a bioretention structure or a bioretention swale stormwater runoff entering the bioretention system is filtered first vegetation and then the sandsoil mixture before being conveyed downstream by the underdrain system runoff storage depths above the planting bed surface are typically shallow the adopted tss removal rate for bioretention systems is 90 percent bioretention systems are used to remove a wide range of pollutants such as suspended solids nutrients metals hydrocarbons and bacteria from stormwater runoff they can also be used to reduce peak runoff rates and increase stormwater infiltration when designed as a multistage multifunction facility  12213   predesign site evaluation for infiltration trench and structure practices a minimum field infiltration rate fc of 052 inches per hour is required  lower rates preclude the use of these practices for surface sand filter and bioretention practices no minimum infiltration rate is required if these facilities are designed with a daylighting underdrain system  otherwise these facilities require a 052 inch per hour rate feasibility testing is to be conducted to screen unsuitable sites and reduce testing costs a soil boring is not required at this stage however a designer or landowner may opt to engage concept design borings at his discretion without feasibility testing initial testing involves either one field test per facility regardless of type or size or previous testing data such as the following  onsite septic percolation testing within 200 feet of the proposed bmp location and on the same contour which can establish initial rate water table andor depth to bedrock  geotechnical report on the site prepared by a qualified geotechnical consultant or  natural resources conservation service nrcs county soil

infiltration rate of greater than 052 inches per hour is probable then the number of concept design test pits shall be per the following table an encased soil boring may be substituted for a test pit if desired  12213   design criteria a storage volume depth and duration bioretention systems shall be designed to treat the runoff volume generated by the stormwater quality design storm twoyear the maximum water depth during treatment of the stormwater quality design storm shall be 12 inches in a bioretention structure and 18 inches in a bioretention swale the minimum diameter of any outlet or overflow orifice is 25 inches the bottom of a bioretention system including any underdrain piping or gravel layer must be a minimum of one foot above the seasonal high groundwater table the planting soil bed and underdrain system shall be designed to fully drain the stormwater quality design storm runoff volume within 72 hours b permeability rates the design permeability rate planting soil bed must be sufficient to fully drain the stormwater quality design storm runoff volume within 72 hours this permeability rate must be determined by field or laboratory testing since the actual permeability rate may vary from test results and may also decrease over time due to soil bed consolidation or the accumulation of sediments removed from the treated stormwater a factor of safety of two shall be applied to the tested permeability rate to determine the design permeability rate therefore if the tested permeability rate of the soil bed material is four incheshour the design rate would be two incheshour ie four inches per hourtwo this design rate would then be used to compute the systems stormwater quality design storm drain time c planting soil bed the planting soil bed provides the environment for water and nutrients to be made available to the vegetation the soil particles can adsorb some additional pollutants exchange and voids within the soil particles can store a portion of the stormwater quality design storm runoff volume the planting soil bed material should consist of ten to 15 percent clays a minimum 65 percent sands with the balance as silts the materials ph should range from 55 to 65 the material shall be placed in 12 to 18 inch lifts the total depth or thickness of the planting soil bed should be a minimum of three feet as noted above the design permeability rate of the soil bed material must be sufficient to drain the stormwater quality design storm runoff volume within 72 hours filter fabric should be placed along the sides of the planting soil bed to prevent the migration of soil particles from the adjacent soil into the planting soil bed d vegetation the vegetation in a bioretention system removes some of the nutrients and other pollutants in the stormwater inflow the use of native plant material is recommended for bioretention systems wherever possible the goal of the planting plan should be to simulate a forestshrub community of primarily upland type in general trees should dominate the perimeter zone that is subject to less frequent inundation shrubs and herbaceous species that are adapted to moister conditions and expected pollutant loads should be selected for the wetter zones the number of stems per acre should average 1000 with tree spacing of 12 feet and shrub spacing of eight feet e sand layer the sand

is not subject to blockage by debris or sediment and is readily accessible for inspection and maintenance blind connections to downstream storm sewers are prohibited g overflows all bioretention systems must be able to safely convey system overflows to downstream drainage systems the capacity of the overflow must be consistent with the remainder of the sites drainage system and sufficient to provide safe stable discharge of stormwater in the event of an overflow h tailwater the hydraulic design of the underdrain and overflow systems as well as any stormwater quantity control outlets must consider any significant tailwater effects of downstream waterways or facilities this includes instances where the lowest invert in the outlet or overflow structure is below the flood hazard area design flood elevation of a receiving stream i maintenance the following requirements must be included in the systems maintenance plan 1 general maintenance all bioretention system components expected to receive andor trap debris and sediment must be inspected for clogging and excessive debris and sediment accumulation at least four times annually as well as after every storm exceeding one inch of rainfall such components may include bottoms trash racks low flow channels outlet structures riprap or gabion aprons and cleanouts sediment removal should take place when the structure is thoroughly dry disposal of debris trash sediment and other waste material should be done at suitable disposalrecycling sites and in compliance with all applicable local state and federal waste regulations 2 vegetated areas mowing andor trimming of vegetation must be performed on a regular schedule based on specific site conditions grass should be mowed at least once a month during the growing season vegetated areas must be inspected at least annually for erosion and scour vegetated areas should also be inspected at least annually for unwanted growth which should be removed with minimum disruption to the planting soil bed and remaining vegetation when establishing or restoring vegetation biweekly inspections of vegetation health should be performed during the first growing season or until the vegetation is established once established inspections of vegetation health density and diversity should be performed at least twice annually during both the growing and nongrowing seasons the vegetative cover should be maintained at 85 percent if vegetation has greater than 50 percent damage the area should be reestablished in accordance with the original specifications and the inspection requirements presented above all use of fertilizers mechanical treatments pesticides and other means to assure optimum vegetation health should not compromise the intended purpose of the bioretention system all vegetation deficiencies should be addressed without the use of fertilizers and pesticides whenever possible 3 structural components all structural components must be inspected for cracking subsidence spalling erosion and deterioration at least annually  12213 infiltration an infiltration structure is a facility constructed within highly permeable soils that provides temporary storage of stormwater runoff an infiltration structure does not normally have a structural outlet to discharge runoff from the stormwater quality design storm instead outflow from an infiltration structure is surrounding soil an infiltration structure may also be combined with an extended detention structure to provide additional runoff storage for both stormwater quality and quantity management the adopted tss removal rate for infiltration structures is 80 percent infiltration structures are used to remove pollutants and to infiltrate stormwater back into the ground such infiltration also helps to reduce increases in both the peak rate and total volume of runoff caused by land development pollutant removal is achieved of the runoff soil as well as biological and chemical activity within the soil  12213   predesign site evaluation infiltration structures can present some practical design problems when planning for an infiltration structure that provides stormwater quality treatment consideration should be given to soil characteristics depth to the groundwater table sensitivity of the region and runoff water quality specifically infiltration structures must not be used in the following locations  industrial and commercial areas where solvents andor petroleum products are loaded unloaded stored or applied or pesticides are loaded unloaded or stored  areas where hazardous materials are expected to be present in greater than reportable quantities as defined by the us environmental protection agency in the federal regulations at 40 cfr 3024  areas where infiltration structure use would be inconsistent with an njdepapproved remedial action work plan or landfill closure plan  areas with high risks for spills of toxic materials such as gas stations and vehicle maintenance facilities  areas where industrial stormwater runoff is exposed to source material source material means any materials or machinery located at an industrial facility that is directly or indirectly related to process manufacturing or other industrial activities that could be a source of pollutants in any industrial stormwater discharge to groundwater source materials include but are not limited to raw materials intermediate products final products waste materials byproducts industrial machinery and fuels and lubricants solvents and detergents that are related to process manufacturing or other industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater  areas where their installation would create a significant risk for basement seepage or flooding cause surficial flooding of groundwater or interfere with the operation of subsurface sewage disposal systems and other subsurface structures such adverse impacts must be assessed and avoided by the design engineer infiltration structures must be configured and located where their construction will not compact the soils below the structure in addition an infiltration structure must not be placed into operation until the contributing drainage area is completely stabilized general setback requirements for infiltration structures soil absorption systems for title 5 systems 50 feet  private wells 100 feet  public wells 150 feet  public reservoir surface water sources for public water systems and their tributaries 400 feet  other surface waters 50 feet  property lines 10 feet  building foundations >10 to 100 feet  depending upon soil types and infiltration structure type soils are perhaps the most important consideration for site suitability in general county soil surveys can be used to obtain necessary soil data for the planning and preliminary design of infiltration structures for final design and construction soil tests are required at the exact location of a proposed structure in order to confirm its ability to function without failure tests should include  determination of the textural classification   permeability of the subgrade soil at and below the bottom of the proposed infiltration structure the recommended minimum depth for subgrade soil analysis is five feet below the bottom of the structure or to the groundwater table soil permeability testing can be conducted in accordance with the standards for individual subsurface sewage disposal systems  12213   design criteria a storage volume depth and duration an infiltration structure must be designed to treat the total runoff volume generated by the structures maximum design storm this may either be the groundwater recharge or stormwater quality design storm depending upon the structures proposed use an infiltration structure must also fully drain this runoff volume within 72 hours runoff storage for greater times can render the structure ineffective and may result in anaerobic conditions odor and both water quality and mosquito breeding problems the bottom of the infiltration structure must be at least two feet above seasonal high water table or bedrock for surface structures this distance must be measured from the bottom of the sand layer the structure bottom must be as level as possible to uniformly distribute runoff infiltration over the subgrade soils to enhance safety by minimizing standing water depths the vertical distance between the structure bottom and the maximum design stormwater surface in surface infiltration structures should be no greater than two feet construction of an infiltration structure must be done without compacting the structures subgrade soils excavation must be performed by equipment placed outside the structure whenever possible this requirement should be considered when designing the dimensions and total storage volume of an infiltration structure it is important to note that the use of infiltration structures is recommended only for the stormwater quality design storm and smaller storm events use of infiltration structures for larger storm events and the requirements by which such structures are to be designed constructed and maintained should be reviewed and approved by all applicable reviewing agencies b permeability rates the minimum design permeability rate of the soils below an infiltration structure will depend upon the structures location and maximum design storm the use of infiltration structures for stormwater quality control is feasible only where soil is sufficiently permeable to allow a reasonable rate of infiltration therefore infiltration structures designed for storms greater than the groundwater recharge storm can be constructed only in areas with hydrologic soil group a and b soils maximum design structure location minimum design permeability rate incheshour groundwater recharge subsurface 02 groundwater recharge surface 05 stormwater quality surface and subsurface 05 in addition to the above the design permeability rate of the soil must be sufficient to fully drain the infiltration structures maximum design storm runoff volume within 72 hours this design permeability rate must be determined by field testing see bioretention pre design since the actual permeability rate may vary from test results and may also decrease over time due to soil bed consolidation or the accumulation of sediments removed from the treated stormwater a factor of safety of two must be applied to the tested permeability rate to determine the design permeability rate therefore if the tested permeability rate of the soils is four incheshour the design rate would be two incheshour ie four inches per hourtwo this design rate would then be used to compute the structures maximum design storm drain time c bottom sand layer to help ensure maintenance of the design permeability rate over time a sixinch layer of sand must be placed on the bottom of an infiltration structure this sand layer can intercept silt sediment and debris that could otherwise clog the top layer of the soil below the structure the sand layer will also facilitate silt sediment and debris removal from the structure and can be readily restored following removal operations the sand layer must meet the specifications of a mdot class ii sand this must be certified by a certified testing lab d overflows all infiltration structures must be able to convey overflows to downstream drainage systems in a safe and stable manner the capacity of the overflow must be consistent with the remainder of the sites drainage system and sufficient to provide safe stable discharge of stormwater in the event of an overflow e subsurface infiltration structures a subsurface infiltration structure is located entirely below the ground surface it may consist of a vault perforated pipe andor stone bed however due to the greater difficulty in removing silt sediment and debris all runoff to a subsurface infiltration structure must be pretreated this pretreatment must remove 80 percent of the tss in the runoff from the structures maximum design storm f basis of design the design of an infiltration basin is based upon darcys law q   kia where q

excessive debris and sediment accumulation at least four times annually as well as after every storm exceeding one inch of rainfall such components may include bottoms riprap or gabion aprons and inflow points this applies to both surface and subsurface infiltration structures sediment removal should take place when the structure is thoroughly dry disposal of debris trash sediment and other waste material should be done at suitable disposalrecycling sites and in compliance with all applicable local state and federal waste regulations  12213 detention storage facilities detention storage facilities are designed to detain runoff for a short period of time and then release it to a watercourse where it returns to the hydrologic cycle the objective of detention storage is to regulate the released runoff rate and to reduce the impact on downstream drainage systems detention storage should not be confused with retention storage ie retention basins a facility with no engineered outlet other than an emergencytype outlet designed to hold runoff for a considerable length of time the water in a retention basin is not discharged to surface water although it may infiltrate in to the ground evaporate or be consumed by plants in keeping with common law natural flow rights and the michigan drain concentrated discharges of stormwater such as the outflow from a detention facility or

the detained outflow would not result in an increase in the peak flow in the receiving watercourse if the detained outflow would result in an increase in the peak flow in the receiving watercourse then stormwater detention is not an acceptable stormwater management option retention of stormwater or other stormwater management design approved by the city engineer must be provided see section 4962100 retention basins for design requirements e portions of the developing site may be allowed to drain unrestricted ie not detention facility if either of the following conditions are met 1 the areas draining unrestricted are not being disturbed or altered by the construction such that they will maintain their existing drainage characteristics and patterns 2 the areas draining unrestricted are being disturbed or altered but will be permanently stabilized to prevent erosion and will not contain any impervious surface postconstruction in this case the unrestricted flow must be draining to a receiving watercourse with valid rightsofway or else written agreement from the affected property owners would have to be obtained per common law natural flow rights and the michigan drain addition

short period of time and then release it to a watercourse a onsite retention or detentionsee section 486299 detention storage facilities is required of all new developments or redevelopments to prevent an increase in peak flows downstream in the drainage district 1 retention basins are an acceptable stormwater management practice on sites where the soil has an infiltration rate of at least 052 inches per hour and a clay content of less than 30 percent per recommendations in guidebook of best management practices for michigan watersheds the required storage volume of a retention basin is

basins with storage volume for the runoff from two consecutive 100year design storms 2 retention basins shall accommodate runoff from offsite areas that drain ontoacross the developing site an exception to this rule would be if offsite runoff were to be routed around the site to a receiving watercourse if done in a manner such that runoff from the developing site would not contribute to
