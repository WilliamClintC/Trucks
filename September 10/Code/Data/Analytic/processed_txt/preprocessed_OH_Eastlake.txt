klammer director of law  editors note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances the comparative is included to show

other testing facility at the potws discretion and performed for an industry because of its discharge to a public sewer and to determine compliance shall be borne by the owner or industry being tested this rate shall be on an hourly basis for time required to conduct such analyses bcost of installation involving overtime where an industrial or commercial user discharges its effluent to a manhole or

permitted gconflict of laboratory results in the event that analysis of wastes determined by the sampling and gauging of wastes from an industry or user by the city personnel does not agree with an analysis of wastes from the industry or user submitted by them to the city a program of resampling and regauging with subsequent chemical determinations may be instituted as follows 1the industry or user interested must submit a request for resampling and regauging and subsequent chemical determinations of the wastes 2the chemist or engineer employed by the industry or user responsible for the analysis submitted to the city shall confer with the city they shall first agree as to the length of the rerun and to the mediums to be employed to determine the flow and to sample the flow 3the chemist or engineer engaged by the industry or user may be present during the resampling and regauging operation and also in the potw laboratory during the chemical determination of the analysis 4the results of the analysis determined from the quantity and quality of the flow shall be considered the analysis of the wastes discharged to the potw or to a watercourse by the industry or user and the sewerage surcharge andor penalties shall be determined from the strength of the wastes as reported in the analysis 5in the event an analysis of wastes determined from the routinely scheduled sampling and gauging of wastes from an industry or user is not considered representative because of breakdown or manufacturing processes or of treatment or pretreatment facilities during the operation and such breakdown or conditions are accepted by the city as legitimate reasons the industry or user can request resampling or regauging of the wastes after the breakdowns are remedied however the industry or user shall agree to bear all costs of the resampling and regauging operation plus the costs of analytical determinations in such cases the potw shall schedule the operation as soon as possible but not to interfere with the rescheduled operations all analytical results so found shall be current and no retroactive refunds shall be made for any differential in concentration established 6it shall be assumed by the city that any industry or user that has treatment or pretreatment facilities and any routinely scheduled sampling and gauging operations conducted at any time shall be considered representative if in the course of several routinely scheduled sampling and gauging operations the industry or user claims that the results of such sampling and gauging are not representative because
