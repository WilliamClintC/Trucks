former ch 1001   and enacted a new ch 1001 as set out herein the former ch 1001 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from  adopted dec 8 2010  and  adopted dec 11 2013 authority purpose and findings a authority  health and safety et seq authorizes the city to adopt ordinances and regulations imposing the same requirements as are contained in the california building standards california regulations title 24 adopted by the state pursuant to health and safety  health and safety 5 and 189415 permit the city to make changes or modifications to the california building standards as are reasonably necessary because such changes or modifications are needed due to climatic geographic or topographic conditions b purpose  the fire official and city building official recommend that certain changes and modifications to the 2016 california building standards are reasonably necessary due to local conditions within the city certain changes and modifications are of an administrative or procedural nature or concern themselves with subjects not covered by the california building standards and certain changes and modifications are reasonably necessary to safeguard life and property within the city of rancho santa margarita c findings of local conditions 1 climatic conditions a orange county and the city of rancho santa margarita are located in a semiarid mediterranean type climate it annually experiences extended periods of high temperatures with little or no precipitation hot dry santa ana winds which may reach speeds of 110 mph or greater are also common to the area these climatic conditions cause extreme drying of vegetation and common building materials frequent periods of drought and low humidity add to the fire danger this predisposes the area to large destructive fires conflagration in addition to directly damaging or destroying buildings these fires are also prone to disrupt utility services throughout the county obstacles generated by a strong wind such as fallen trees street lights and utility poles will greatly impact the response time to reach an incident scene additionally there is a significant increase in the amount of wind force at 60 feet above the ground use of aerial type firefighting apparatus above this height would place rescue personnel at increased risk of injury b the climate alternates between extended periods of drought and brief flooding conditions flood conditions may affect the orange county fire authoritys ability to respond to a fire or emergency condition floods also disrupt utility services to buildings and facilities within the county c water demand in this densely populated area far exceeds the quantity supplied by natural precipitation  and although the population continues to grow the alreadytaxed water supply does not california is projected to increase in population by nearly 10 million over the next quarter of a century with 50 percent of that growth centered in southern california due to storage capacities and consumption and a limited amount of rainfall future water allocation is not fully dependable this necessitates the need for additional and onsite fire protection features it would also leave tall buildings vulnerable to uncontrolled fires due to a lack of available water and an inability to pump sufficient quantities of available water to floors in a fire d these dry climatic conditions and winds contribute to the rapid spread of even small fires originating in highdensity housing or vegetation these fires spread very quickly and create a need for increased levels of fire protection the added protection of fire sprinkler systems and other fire protection features will supplement normal fire department response by providing immediate protection for the building occupants and by containing and controlling the fire spread to the area of origin fire sprinkler systems will also reduce the use of water for firefighting by as much as 50 to 75 percent 2 topographical conditions a natural slopes of 15 percent or greater generally occur throughout the foothills of orange county the elevation change cause by the hills creates the geological foundation on which communities within orange county are built and will continue to be built with much of the populated flatlands already built upon future growth will occur in areas with steeper slopes and greater constraints in terrain b road circulation features located throughout the county also make amendments reasonably necessary located county are major roadways highways and flood control channels that create barriers and slow response times hills slopes street and storm drain design accompanied with occasional heavy rainfall cause roadway flooding and landslides and at times may make an emergency access route impassable there are areas in orange county that naturally have extended fire department emergency response times that exceed the 5 minute goal c placement of multiple occupancy buildings location of arterial roads and fire department staffing constraints due to recent revenuelimiting state legislation have made it difficult for the fire department to locate additional fire stations and provide manpower sufficient to concentrate fire companies and personnel to control fires in high density apartment or condominium buildings fire department equipment does not allow easy access to areas of buildings greater than 55 feet above the level of fire department vehicle access these conditions create the need for builtin onsite fire protection systems to protect occupants and property until fire fighting apparatus and personnel arrive on the scene d these topographical conditions combine to create a situation which places fire department response time to fire occurrences at risk and makes it necessary to provide automatic onsite fireextinguishing systems and other protection measures to protect occupants and property 3 geological conditions a orange county and the city of rancho santa margarita are located in a highly active seismic area there are earthquake faults that run along both the northeastern and southwestern boundaries of orange county the newportinglewood fault zone nifz which runs county was the source of the destructive 1933 long beach earthquake 63 magnitude hypocenter off newport beach coast which took 120 lives with areas damaged from laguna beach to marina del rey and inland to whittier and poses one of the greatest hazards to lives and property in the nation regional planning for reoccurrence is recommended by the state of california department of conservation there was also an earthquake in december 198 with the epicenter located near the city of irvine the fault on which this quake occurred was unknown prior to this activity the  santa cruz earthquake resulted in only one major san francisco fire in the marina district but when combined with the 34 other fires and over 500 responses the department was taxed to its full capabilities the marina fire was difficult to contain because mains supplying water to the district burst during the earthquake if more fires had been ignited by the earthquake it would have been difficult for the fire department to contain them experts predict a major earthquake in our area within the next 50 years this situation creates the need for both additional fire protection measures and automatic onsite fire protection for building occupants since a multitude of fires may result from breakage of gas and electric lines as a result of an earthquake as noted by planning scenario on a major earthquake on the newportinglewood fault zone 198 state department of conservation  unfortunately barely meeting the minimum earthquake standards of building codes places a building on the verge of being legally unsafe b traffic and circulation congestion presently existing in the city of rancho santa margarita often places fire department response time to fire occurrences at risk this condition will be exacerbated by any major disaster including any earthquake wherein damage to the highway system will occur this condition makes the need for additional onsite protection for property occupants necessary c the city of rancho santa margarita is located in an area subject to a climatic condition of high winds and low humidity this combination of events creates an environment which is conducive to rapidly spreading fires control of such fires requires rapid response obstacles generated by a strong wind such as fallen trees street lights and utility poles and the requirement to climb 75 feet vertically up flights of stairs will greatly impact the response time to reach an incident scene additionally figure 62 of asce 7 identifies a significant increase in the amount of wind force at 60 feet above the ground use of aerial type fire fighting apparatus above this height would place rescue personnel at increased risk of injury d the city of rancho santa margarita is located in the middle of the seismically active area the viability of the public water system would be questionable at best after a major seismic event this would leave tall buildings vulnerable to uncontrolled fires due to a lack of available water and an inability to pump sufficient quantities of any available water to floors above the 55foot level a severe seismic event has the potential to negatively impact any rescue or fire suppression activities because it is likely to create obstacles similar to those indicated under the high wind section above with the probability of strong aftershocks there exists a need to provide increased protection for anyone on upper floors e untreated wood roofs cause or contribute to serious fire hazard and to the rapid spread of fires when such fires are accompanied by high winds pieces of burning wooden roofs become flying brands and are carried by the wind to other locations and thereby spread fire quickly recent grand jury report findings support this concern f soils throughout the county possess corrosive properties that reduce the expected usable life of water services when metallic pipes in contact with soils are utilized g portions of the county contain active or former oil production fields these areas contain a variety of naturally occurring gases liquids and vapors these compounds present toxicity or flammability hazards to building occupants evaluation of these hazards and the risks they pose to development is necessary to implement appropriate mitigation due to the topographical conditions of sprawling development separated by waterways and narrow and congested streets and the expected infrastructure damage inherent in seismic zone described above it is prudent to rely on automatic fire sprinkler systems to mitigate extended fire department response time and keep fires manageable with reduced fire flow water requirements for given structures additional fire protection is also justified to match the current resources of firefighting equipment and personnel within the orange county fire authority additional amendments have

areas of the city may be subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by uses being inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effects of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss  6212001 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  6212001 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas  6212001

that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  6212001 appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall he recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the orange county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency  6212001 conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of seq and  et seq of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond one half acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance c variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in this chapter cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances d variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections a e are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance e upon consideration of the factors of subsection a and the purposes of this chapter the city may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  6212001 grading and excavation footnotes  8  editors note prior to the reenactment of by  adopted   adopted  repealed the former in its entirety which pertained to the
