followup period especially the first 6  12 weeks after exposure exposed workers should follow the us public health service recommendation for preventing transmission of hiv these include refraining from blood donations and using appropriate protection during sexual intercourse during all phases of followup it is vital that worker confidentiality be protected if the source individual was tested and found to be seronegative baseline testing of the exposed worker with followup testing twelve 12 weeks later may be performed if desired by the worker or recommended by the health care provider if the source individual cannot be identified decisions regarding appropriate followup should be individualized serologic testing should be made available by the town to all workers who may be concerned
