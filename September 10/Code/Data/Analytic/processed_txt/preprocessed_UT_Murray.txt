the citys operation and maintenance of and improvements to the system iimpervious area is an important factor influencing stormwater service requirements and costs posed by properties and therefore is an appropriate factor for calculating stormwater utility fees jthe future usefulness of the system including any additions and improvements and the capability of the city to comply with federal and state mandates depends on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance the system in order to do so the city must have adequate and stable funding for its

chapter  incentive density bonus  purpose  baseline density  baseline requirements  categories  density bonus criteria  purpose the objective of this chapter is to provide incentives to encourage higher quality development by providing better design landscaping building materials off street parking facilities energy efficiency and neighborhood compatibility this will provide incentive towards better housing longevity which will stabilize and preserve neighborhoods and provide a high quality environment in the community this chapter provides a process by which projects may be allowed to expand in density if they comply with the criteria outlined in this chapter   baseline density baseline density for all multiplefamily zoning is that density allowed by each multiplefamily zone   baseline requirements baseline requirements are the minimum standards which must be met for development this is based on complying with all zoning and building regulations and subdivision ordinances progressively higher standards are required to gain increments of higher density   categories these category requirements were chosen because these factors are the major influential areas which contribute to the longevity aesthetic and neighborhood compatibility of a project the categories are as follows astructure design structural design is the architectural appearance of the buildings and the relationship to the site and the surrounding area each successively higher level of density will require successively better design goals the requirements will be based on increasing variation in form color scheme materials setbacks floor plans elevations height bulk and sensitivity to surrounding land use and land forms these features must be integrated into the total design of the site structure and landscaping variation in design must be successfully integrated in the proposal and not treated as an afterthought to a cookie cutter plan and elevation the goal is to design a project that creates a planned coordinated functional aesthetic development the project will fit in scale to the area and the site specifically blandscaping landscape design is critical in creating a positive environment in a project an excellent landscape design need not incur proportionately higher costs for the relatively high visual impact that it has on the aesthetic value of a development water conservation principles will also be considered in the total landscape scheme skillfully integrated into the housing recreational parking and buffer areas can greatly enhance the sense of unity for the entire site design knowledgeable landscape design and implementation can also be a positive influence on energy consumption on the site landscape design requirements will be progressively more demanding as the densities increase more mature landscaping stock and terrain variation will be required cbuilding materials building materials play a key role in the aesthetic appearance and value of a project excellent building materials and finishes promote quality and longevity in a structure emphasis is placed on masonry exteriors for low maintenance characteristics increasing amounts of masonry will be required for higher densities dparking facilities location size and number of stalls play a vital role in the function of good design parking areas must provide safe access to public streets and to the housing on site parking locations are encouraged to be located out of front yard areas with buffering landscaping and berming areas for recreational vehicles and extra standard vehicles should be located on site at appropriate locations and screened by barrier fencing and landscaping covered parking improvements will be required by upgrading facilities with each increment of higher density eurban designneighborhood compatibility site compatibility to surrounding land use and structures is very critical design measures which can be taken to effectively integrate a new housing development into a neighborhood will have a highly positive impact on the way the neighbors perceive and respond to the development a successful design will incorporate or acknowledge surrounding developments with emphasis in tapering height to abutting structures great effort should be made to integrate architectural compatibility with surrounding residential structures other features must also be considered such as access traffic schools utilities soils shopping water table floodplains wetlands recreational amenities and existing trees faffordable housing the state of utah recognizes in utah section 109a403 that the availability of moderate income housing is an important part of the city general plan the spirit of the statute is to ensure that people who desire to live in murray should be able to do so regardless of income people expect the city to offer a reasonable opportunity to a variety of housing which is located throughout the community with such an opportunity people with moderate incomes are allowed to benefit from and to fully participate in all aspects of neighborhood and community life   density bonus criteria to gain bonus density in any
