cannabis control act  1 legislative declaration the general assembly recognized that 1 the current state of scientific and medical knowledge concerning the effects of cannabis makes it necessary to acknowledge the physical psychological and sociological damage which is incumbent upon its use  and 2 the use of cannabis occupies the unusual position of being widely used and pervasive among the citizens of illinois despite its harmful effects  and 3 previous legislation enacted to control or forbid the use of cannabis has often unnecessarily and unrealistically drawn a large segment of our population within the criminal justice system without succeeding in deterring the expansion of cannabis use it is therefore the intent of the general assembly in the interest of the health and welfare of the citizens of illinois to establish a reasonable penalty system which is responsive to the current state of knowledge concerning cannabis and which directs the greatest efforts of law enforcement agencies toward the commercial traffickers and largescale purveyors of cannabis to this end this act provides wide latitude in the sentencing discretion of the courts and established penalties in a sharply rising progression based on the amount of substances containing cannabis involved in each case ilcs ch 720 act 550  1  2 short title this act shall be known and may be cited as the cannabis

the ultimate decision as to the final location of any park site or the acceptance of a cash contribution in lieu thereof must be reserved to the village the village recognizes that the ultimate

require cash contributions in lieu of the dedication of the parcel of land  or bmay at its sole option require dedication or conveyance of the parcel to ithe village  or iisuch other person or organization as the village board of trustees determines to be best suited to meet the recreational needs of the residents ccredit for private open spaces and recreation areas 1when subdividers or developers provide private recreation areas and facilities it may have the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreational services ahowever such private areas and facilities are difficult or impossible to develop and maintain because ownership usually is surrendered to the adjacent owners or a homeowners association who might not have the personnel or the financial resources for maintenance and improvement bnevertheless there may be instances in which the public is better served by providing for private recreation areas and facilities in lieu of public ones ccredit for private recreation areas and facilities may be allowed only where the village board of trustees has made a determination that private recreational areas in lieu of or in conjunction with publicly dedicated recreational areas will by reason of the type of development better serve the interests of the public than where wholly public dedications are required 2where allowed a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities including equipment by the developer as part of his or her obligation adetailed plans of such areas including specifications of facilities to be installed must be approved by the village and before any credit is given for private recreation areas the subdivider or developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents bprivate swimming clubs are included in the provision cwhen an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted it will be necessary to compute the total parkland dedication that would have been required from the subdivision

objective of this chapter to control soil erosion and sedimentation caused by development activities including clearing grading stripping excavating and filling of land in the village measures taken to control soil erosion and offsite sediment runoff should be adequate to assure that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of tenyear frequency or less the following principles shall apply to all development activities within the village and to the preparation of the submissions required under  15704 1development should be related to the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible 2natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible areas within 25 feet of natural watercourses lakes ponds and wetlands should be left undisturbed wherever possible temporary crossing of watercourses when permitted must include appropriate stabilization measures 3special precautions should be taken to prevent damages resulting from any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream lake pond or wetland preventative measures should reflect the sensitivity of these areas to erosion and sedimentation 4the smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest practical time during development 5sediment basins or traps filter barriers diversions and any other appropriate sediment or runoff control measures should be installed prior to site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing development 6the selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion and on evaluation of the risks costs and benefits involved 7in the design of erosion control facilities and practices aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered 8those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land uses should be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to development 9permanent vegetation and structures should be installed and functional as soon as practical during development 10provision should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities and rates of discharge will not create additional erosion onsite or downstream 11all waste generated as a result of site development activity should be properly disposed of and should be prevented from being carried off the site by either wind or water 12all construction sites should provide measures to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways passed 112095
