board of zoning adjustment request for variance notice to applicants a variance is a zoning adjustment which permits property owners to use their property in a manner that would not normally be allowed under the terms of the current zoning purpose of a variance is to give relief to those owners who due to unique conditions would face an unnecessary hardship in using the property in full compliance with the are two 2 types of variances 1 area variance 2 use variance an area variance recognizes that the same district requirements do not affect all properties equally it modifies site development standards of a zoning district by providing relief from the strict application of the dimensional requirements of the zoning relate to setbacks from property lines site coverage and floor area ratios minimum lot sizes height of buildings location of accessory structures and parking standards in order to be granted a variance the property owner must prove that hisher land is affected by special circumstances or unusual conditions that prevent the reasonable use of the land as permitted by zoning district in which the property in question is located which would result in an unnecessary hardship in using the property and unequal treatment under the strict application of the city of chickasaw s zoning some general hardship conditions extend to other properties a variance cannot be granted the remedy for general hardship or multiple hardships is an amendment of the map or the text of the city of chickasaws zoning following conditions do not meet the requirements for an area variance and therefore cannot be considered pertinent to the application for a variance 1 proof that a variance would increase the financial return from the land 2 personal hardship 3 selfimposed hardship a use variance allows property to be used for an activity or use that is otherwise not permitted in the zoning district by the zoning is potentially damaging to the integrity of the it is essentially the rezoning of property and when it is approved it could create piecemeal zoning or spot zoning that is not in conformity with the comprehensive plan once granted it remains with the land and it sets a precedence that others may follow both types of variance should be measured against rigorous standards and should be granted sparingly no variance may be granted which would adversely affect surrounding property or the general neighborhood all variances must be in harmony with the intent and purposes of the city of chickasaws comprehensive plan 2030 and the current zoning the
