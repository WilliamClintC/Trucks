council finds that this chapter shall not result in any term of office being increased or decreased by more than twelve months    campaign contribution limitations  title this chapter may be cited as the campaign contribution limits of the city of west sacramento           findings the city council of the city of west sacramento finds and declares as follows a the policy of this city is to protect the integrity of the electoral process local government should serve the needs and respond to the wishes of all citizens equally without regard to their wealth b monetary contributions to political campaigns are a legitimate form of participation in the political process but the financial strength of certain individuals or organizations should not permit them to exercise a disproportionate or controlling influence on the election of candidates for municipal office c the increasing amounts of expenditures in political campaigns have forced many candidates for elective office to raise larger and larger sums from individuals or interest groups with a specific financial stake in city matters this can cause a public perception that the decisions of the mayor and city council members are being improperly influenced by monetary contributions these perceptions can undermine the credibility of the mayor and city council and the elective and governmental processes d the best interests of the citizens of the city are served by reducing direct and indirect campaign contributions e the city finds that limitations on contributions of money services and materials by individuals or groups to municipal election campaigns should be imposed by law to protect the public health safety and welfare these limitations however should be reasonable so as not to discourage personal expression or participation in the political process f campaign spending for municipal office campaigns is escalating to dangerous and unreasonable levels the integrity of the legislative process the competitiveness of campaigns and public confidence in elected municipal officials are all diminishing because of the perceived effects of large campaign contributions           purpose and intent the city council of the city enacts the ordinance codified in this chapter to accomplish the following purposes a to encourage public trust in the electoral and decisionmaking processes of the city and to ensure that individuals and interest groups have a fair and equal opportunity to participate in the elective and legislative process  b to reduce the potential for influence by large contributors with a specific financial stake in matters before the city thus countering the perception that decisions of municipal officials are influenced by the size of contributions rather than by the merits of proposals and the best interests of the people of the city  c to encourage smaller contributions  d to help ensure public trust in the citys legislative and electoral institutions  e to limit the use of loans and credit in the financing of political campaigns for city elective office  f to provide in conjunction with the political reform act and the regulations adopted by the california fair political practices commission implementing the political reform act a comprehensive system for regulating the conduct of campaigns for city elective office which for example prohibits defined officials from receiving or soliciting campaign contributions of more than two hundred fifty dollars from defined persons during proceedings before the city in which such defined persons are interested and for three months thereafter government            definitions unless a particular word or phrase is otherwise specifically defined in this chapter or the contrary is stated or clearly

throughout the city has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses and has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places but also to an

cause fear and intimidation unwanted physical contact or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic the city council further finds that the presence of individuals who solicit money from persons at or near banks automated teller machines or in public transportation vehicles is especially troublesome because of the enhanced fear of crime in those confined environments motorists also find themselves confronted by persons seeking money who without permission wash their automobile windows at traffic intersections despite explicit instructions by drivers not to do so people driving or parking on city streets frequently find themselves faced with persons seeking money by offering to open car doors or locate parking spaces such activities carry with them an implicit threat

of california penal law is timely and appropriate because current laws and city regulations are insufficient to address the aforementioned problems e the law is not intended to limit any persons from

and are subject to ever increasing demands  2 that the continuation of californias economic prosperity is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses  3 that it is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource  4 that landscapes are essential to the quality of life in california by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water preventing erosion offering fire protection and replacing ecosystems lost to development  and 5 that landscape design installation maintenance and management can and should be water efficient  and 6 that of of the california constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use b consistent with these legislative findings the purpose of this chapter is to 1 promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that integrate and go beyond the conservation and efficient use of water  2 establish a structure for planning designing installing maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that requires crosssector collaboration of industry government and property owners to achieve the many benefits possible  3 establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing landscapes  4 use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied water allowance as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount  5 promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with neighboring local and regional agencies c landscapes that are planned designed installed managed and maintained with the watershed based approach can improve californias environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability goals such landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face of climatic extremes consistent with the legislative findings and purpose of the chapter conditions in the urban setting will be improved by 1 creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing compaction incorporating organic matter that increases water retention and promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon storage oxygen production shade habitat and esthetic benefits 2 minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water requirements reducing reliance on petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides and planting climate appropriate shade trees in urban areas 3 conserving water by capturing and reusing graywater wherever possible and selecting climate appropriate plants that need minimal supplemental water after establishment 4 protecting air and water quality by reducing power equipment use and landfill disposal trips selecting recycled and locally sourced materials and using compost mulch and efficient irrigation equipment to prevent erosion 5 protecting existing habitat

income households the housing element of the citys general plan which guides and directs new growth and development calls for an implementing chapter to further the affordable housing goals of the city and address state housing requirements including the citys regional fair share allocation pursuant to government  the lack of affordable housing has a direct impact upon the health safety and

of this section is satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of  variance procedure  nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of this title are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this title would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of west sacramento to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this title are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this title are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate   procedure a in passing upon requests for variances the floodplain administrator shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this title and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the floodplain administrator that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the yolo county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency     issuance conditions a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level  providing that the procedures of chapters 1816 and 1820 of this title have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in of this title upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this title for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the floodplain administrator need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the floodplain administrator believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this title e variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in  to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in   see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a e are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance g upon consideration of the

not been successfully completed by the time of such reinspection for each reinspection there shall be a reinspection fee levied against the owners in an amount established by resolution of the city council there shall be no inspection fee charged for an inspection caused by any service request if no violation is discovered b notice to abate fee where a violation continues to exist following the

findings a it is imperative to establish enforceable minimum standards for residential buildings and to provide a program for enforcing these standards that is selfsupporting b service request initiated enforcement actions are insufficient to provide the essential level of abatement of substandard housing conditions needed by this community c violators of the state housing law must bear the largest feasible share of the cost of housing code enforcement d rental property owners derive a substantial benefit from a housing code enforcement program and should therefore contribute to a portion of program costs e residents of rental property also benefit from a housing code enforcement program and should therefore contribute to program costs indirectly cost of renting such holdings f it is necessary to establish an operating fund which is separate from the citys general fund for the purpose of implementing a housing code enforcement program and operating it on an ongoing basis it is necessary that this source of funds be predictable and reliable for the efficient and continued operation of such a program the imposition of a housing stock conversation fee is an appropriate means to accomplish this purpose g it is recognized that the majority of rental housing property owners comply with the state housing law and applicable city ordinances and that only a relatively small percentage violates these laws and while it is the intent of this code that this group of violators should pay for as much of the cost of a housing code enforcement program as is practical and feasible it is also recognized that the collection of enforcement fees and penalties from violators can be a protracted and costly process and that reliance thereupon as the sole source to fund such a program is inherently speculative and unrealistic therefore while the primary source of revenue for this housing code enforcement program is intended to come from the collection of enforcement fees and penalties from violators the housing stock conservation fee is intended to make up program costs deficiencies the reliance of such a program on the citys general fund for its costs of operation shall be minimized to the greatest extent possible   housing stock conservation fee city council may by resolution establish a housing conservation fee to be imposed on all owners of residential rental property and hotel rooms in an amount not to exceed the cost of providing the services described in the owner of residential housing shall not allow or cause a tenant to occupy any rental
