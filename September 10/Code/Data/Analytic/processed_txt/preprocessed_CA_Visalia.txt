prevailing wage law for all local projects even those that do not utilize state funding the city council finds that such requirement will cause local projects which do not involve any state funding and must therefore be paid for entirely from local funds to increase in cost significantly thereby constituting a detriment to the residents of the city of visalia whose tax dollars are utilized for local projects the city council further finds that sb 7 has been challenged by other cities on constitutional grounds and such litigation is still pending as of the adoption of this city council finds that as long as sb 7 of the california labor  remains valid law the city intends to comply with sb 7s conditions regarding local projects in order to continue to receive state funding on nonlocal

application for and duration of permit penalty provisions revocation of permit severability legislative purpose this chapter is enacted in response to the serious adverse effects caused certain residential areas and neighborhoods of the city of visalia by motor vehicle congestion particularly the longterm parking of motor vehicles on the streets of such areas and neighborhoods by nonresidents thereof as set forth in more specific detail in this chapter such longterm parking by nonresidents threatens the health safety and welfare of the residents of the city of visalia in order to protect and promote the integrity of these areas and neighborhoods it is necessary to enact parking regulations restricting unlimited parking by nonresidents therein while providing the opportunity for residents to park near their homes uniform parking regulations restricting resident and nonresidents alike would not serve the public interest rather such regulation would contribute to neighborhood decline while ignoring the public transit alternatives to automobile travel available to nonresidents for the reasons set forth in this chapter a system of preferential resident parking is enacted for the city of visalia  exh a part 1999 legislative findings the city council makes the following specific legislative findings in support of preferential resident parking as illustrations of the need compelling the enactment of this chapter they are intended as illustrations only and do not exhaust the subject of the factual basis supporting its adoption athe safety health and welfare of the residents of visalia can be greatly enhanced by maintenance of the attractiveness and livability of its residential neighborhoods and other residential areas and by preserving the character of such areas and neighborhoods as residential bcertain neighborhoods and areas of visalia do not have sufficient on or offstreet space to accommodate the convenient parking of motor vehicles by residents thereof in the vicinity of their homes because of the influxes of motor vehicles owned by nonresidents which compete for the available onstreet parking spaces this causes an unreasonable burden in residential neighborhoods in obtaining parking near their residences and in gaining access to their homes cthere further exist certain parking attractors such as commercial and institutional uses which further exacerbate resident parking problems these entities have attracted progressively more people every year so that the parking problem in some areas exists seven days a week dunnecessary vehicle miles noise pollution trash and strain on interpersonal relationships caused by the conditions set forth herein work unacceptable hardships on residents of these neighborhoods and other residential areas by causing the deterioration of air quality safety tranquillity and other values available in an urban residential environment eif allowed to continue unchecked these adverse effects on the residents of the city will contribute to a further decline of the living conditions therein a reduction in the attractiveness of residing within this city and especially these affected neighborhoods and are consequently injurious to the general public welfare fa system of preferential resident parking as enacted in this chapter will serve to promote the safety health and welfare of all the residents of the city by reducing unnecessary personal motor vehicle travel noise and pollution and by promoting improvements in air quality the convenience and attractiveness of urban residential living and the increased use of public mass transit facilities available now and in the future the public welfare will also be served by ensuring a more stable and valuable property tax base in order to generate the revenues necessary to provide essential public services  exh a part 1999 definitions as used in this chapter the following terms are defined in this section commuter

result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstruction in special flood hazard areas which increase flood heights and velocities may also contribute to the flood loss dstatement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1protect human life and health  2minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding events and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4minimize prolonged business interruptions  5minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and

manufactured homes in fregulatory floodways fema has stated in the fis that the city is characterized as an urbanized inactive alluvial fan system which consists of highly trained creeks and irrigation channels this system of creeks and channels does not have the capacity to contain the base flood and therefore the establishment of regulatory floodways is not possible the resulting flooding from the base flood consists of areas of shallow flooding with overland flows characterized by relatively stable flow paths community with flow velocities ranging from 05 to 20 feet per second this velocity range of the flood flows is considered low and not extremely hazardous  therefore the following provisions apply 1new construction substantial development or other development

procedures the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners aconditions for variances generally variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the bfe providing the procedures of b111 have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases bvariances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure cvariances shall not be issued within any regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result dvariances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance evariances shall only be issued upon 1receipt of a written request for variance from the owner of record stating the conditions that constitute an extreme hardship  2a showing of good and sufficient cause such as renovation rehabilitation or reconstruction variances issued for economic considerations aesthetic or because variances have been used in the past are not good and sufficient causes  3a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  4a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization to the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances fany applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the bfe will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2such construction below the bfe increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the tulare county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land gvariances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of e are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance hupon consideration of the factors of this section and the purpose of this chapter the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter ithe floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the fema upon request

that spills over natural boundaries or architectural features and obliterates parts of upper floors of buildings is detrimental to visual order and will not be permitted common indicators of compatibility include 1quality sign design and construction  2proportional size and scale  and 3use of materials shapes and colors that complement the buildings architectural style and the surrounding environment blegibility the size and proportion of the elements of the signs message including logos letters icons and other graphic images should be selected based on the average distance and average travel speed of the viewer sign messages oriented towards pedestrians may be smaller than those oriented towards automobile drivers colors chosen for the sign text andor graphics should have sufficient contrast with the sign background in order to be easily read during both day and night symbols and logos can be used in place of words substantial contrast should be provided between the color and materials of the background and the letters or symbols to make the sign easier to read in both day and night creadability a sign message should be easily recognized and designed in a clear unambiguous and concise manner so that a viewer can understand or make sense of what appears on the sign dvisibility a sign should be conspicuous and readily distinguishable from its surroundings so a viewer can easily see the information it communicates eplacement often a buildings architectural details create logical places for signage signs should not cover or interrupt architectural details or ornaments of a buildings faade on buildings with a monolithic or plain faade signs can establish or continue appropriate design rhythm scale and proportion welldesigned and welllocated retail signs create visual interest and continuity with other storefronts on the same or adjacent buildings signs should not obstruct windows or doors part 2017  part 2016 rules for sign measurement acalculation of sign area the area of an individual sign must be calculated as follows 1singlefaced signs sign area includes the entire area within a single continuous perimeter composed of squares or rectangles that enclose the extreme limits of all sign elements including but not limited to sign structures or borders written copy logos symbols illustrations and color supporting structures such as sign bases and columns are not included in sign area provided that they contain no lettering or graphics except for addresses or required tags the calculation of sign area for various types of singlefaced signs is illustrated in figure a2 2doublefaced signs where two faces of a doublefaced sign are located two feet or less from one another at all points or located at an interior angle of 45 degrees or less from one another the sign area must be computed as the area of one face where the two faces are not equal in size the larger sign face will be used where two faces of a doublefaced sign are located more than two feet or 45 degrees from one another both sign faces will be counted toward sign area see figure a3 figure a2 measurement of sign area  3multifaced signs on a threefaced sign where at least one interior angle is 45 degrees or less the area of two faces the largest and smallest face must be summed to determine sign area in all other situations involving a sign with three or more sides sign area will be calculated as the sum of all faces figure a3 measurement of multifaced signs  4threedimensional signs signs that consist of or have attached to them one or more threedimensional objects ie balls cubes clusters of objects sculpture or statuelike trademarks may have a sign area that is the sum of two adjacent sides of the smallest cube that will encompass the sign see figure a4 figure a4 measurement of 3dimensional signs  bcalculation of lot frontage if a lot fronts on two streets both frontages may be used for calculating the allowable sign area on lots with three or more frontages on a public street the length of only two contiguous sides shall be added together to determine allowable sign area cmeasuring sign height the height of a sign is the vertical distance measured from the ground level directly beneath the sign to the highest point at the top of the sign including any structural or architectural components of the sign the ground level shall be either the natural grade or finished grade whichever is lowest 1height of freestanding signs the height of freestanding signs shall be measured as the vertical distance from grade at the edge of the rightofway along which a sign is placed to the highest point of the sign including any structural or architectural components of the sign when the grade at the edge of the rightofway is higher than the site on which the sign is placed that portion of the sign below the grade at the edge of the rightofway shall not be included in determining the signs overall height signs oriented towards a freeway shall be measured from the project site grade or pad whichever is lower dmeasuring sign clearance sign clearance shall be measured as the smallest vertical distance between finished grade and the lowest point of the sign including any framework or other embellishments ebuilding frontage building frontage is the building facade that directly abuts a public street private street parking lot
