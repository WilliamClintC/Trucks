greenwich are an extraordinary and limited resource it is therefore the policy of the planning and zoning commission to control the uses and intensity of development in the waterfront business zone so as to enhance the value of waterfront land for the intended purpose of retaining and encouraging commercial uses which depend on a waterfront location and encourage land uses that maximize opportunities for public access while protecting natural resources to that end the waterfront shall be developed following the schedule of priorities herein i the first priority of this zone is to protect and nurture existing and potential waterdependent uses  ii the second priority is to encourage other water related uses so long as they do not interfere with waterdependent uses either directly by displacement or indirectly by placing incompatible demands on the zones infrastructure  iii water enhanced uses are encouraged provided that they do not interfere with and are not incompatible with first and second priority uses and meet the special requirements of e   the purpose of these zoning regulations is to regulate the type and size of development in business zoned waterfront properties in order to  1 implement the goals of the connecticut coastal area management act and of the building zone regulations  the coastal overlay zone   2 preserve scenic vistas by permitting development of a height and mass which will be compatible with the public enjoyment of waterfront views   3 to give high priority and preference to uses and facilities which are dependent upon proximity to the water or the shorelands immediately adjacent to marine and tidal waters   4 to capitalize on the waterfronts unique attributes as a recreational resource accessible either owned land or commercial water dependent establishments  and to assure that these limited waterfront areas are reserved for the uses they are uniquely suited for and are not preempted by uses which can be

general public while protecting the public safety and general welfare of the town and minimizing any adverse visual and operational effects of towers or wireless communication facilities analysis design siting and screening the planning and zoning commission recognizes that it is in the public interest to permit the siting of wireless communication towers and antennas within the towns boundaries this regulation establishes standards and requirements for telecommunication facilities and sites these regulations are also meant to meet the spirit and intent of l e of the cgs for projects that are subject to the approval of the connecticut state siting council by which municipalities are afforded the right of prefiled technical information and consultation with applicants for telecommunication towers and facilities 60 days before an application is filed with the connecticut state siting council the purposes are to regulate placement of antennas towers and other related facilities in a manner that will protect the towns visual quality  and safeguard the community by having the following objectives objectives  to obtain information necessary to evaluate a proposed facility   to minimize locations in residential zones seek locations in business zones   to limit the number andor height of telecommunication towers throughout the community especially by requiring multipleuser sharing of telecommunication facilities wherever possible colocation   to establish locations least disruptive to the public safety and welfare of the town of greenwich and are consistent with the town plan of conservation and development   to minimize the number of towers needed to serve the community both now and in the future by maximizing the use of existing and approved suitable facilities including existing towers buildings and other facilities to accommodate new wireless telecommunications antennas   to minimize adverse visual effects design siting and screening in keeping with the towns character   to minimize negative effect on adjoining property values   to protect scenic roads and historic resources as identified in the town plan of conservation and development from encroachment by inappropriate structures   to avoid injury and potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure structural standards of engineering and careful siting of tower structures and setback requirements  61401 greenwich municipal code 61401 1027  to enhance the ability of providers of telecommunication services to provide such services to the community effectively and efficiently
