numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses

in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example can be added between section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the

governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the malvern city council of the city of malvern arkansas does ordain as set out in this chapter a 1987   findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city of malvern are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage b 1987   statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area c 1987   methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  6 require that no construction will occur on any home or commercial structure with the floor lower than the 100yearflood

structures listed on the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter f variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing the relevant factors in b have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond the onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases g upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter the board of zoning adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter see  h variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result i prerequisites for granting variances 1 variances shall only by issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief 2 variances shall only be issued upon i showing a good and sufficient cause  ii a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and iii a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 3 any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation j variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that i the criteria outlined in subsections a i of this section are met and ii the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety d 1987   constructiongeneral standards in all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements 1 all new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads including the effects of buoyancy  2 all new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage  3 all new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage  4 all new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical heating ventilation plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed andor located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding  5 all new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system  6 new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the systems into floodwaters  and 7 onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding a 1987   constructionspecific standards in all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in i ii 8 or iii d the following provisions are required 1 residential construction new construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor including basement elevated to or above the base flood elevation a registered professional engineer architect or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in a1 is satisfied 2 nonresidential construction new construction and substantial improvements of any commercial industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor including basement elevated to or above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy a registered professional engineer or architect shall develop andor review structural design specifications and plans for the construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection a record of such certification which includes the specific elevation in relation to mean sea level to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator 3 enclosures new construction and substantial improvements with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria a a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided b the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade c openings may be equipped with screens louvers valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters 4 manufactured homes a require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone a shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage for the purpose of this requirement manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation collapse or lateral movement methods of anchoring may include but are not limited to use of overthetop or frame ties to ground anchors this requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces b all manufactured homes shall be in compliance with subdivision 1 of this section c require that all manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within zones a130 ah and ae on the communitys firm be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation  and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provision of this subdivision b 1987   standards for subdivision proposals a all subdivision proposals including manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with of this chapter b all proposals for the development of subdivisions including manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development permit requirements of this chapter c base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than fifty lots or five acres whichever is lesser if not otherwise provided pursuant to 8 d all subdivision proposals including manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards e all subdivision proposals including manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage c 1987   standards for areas of shallow flooding aoah zones located within the areas of special flood hazard established in are areas designated as shallow flooding these areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow  therefore the following provisions apply 1 all new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor including basement elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the communitys firm at least two feet if no depth number is specified  2 all new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures  a have the lowest floor including basement elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the communitys firm at least two feet if no depth number is specified or b together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls subtantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy  3 a registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section as proposed in a1 are satisfied 4 require within zones ah or ao adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures d 1987   floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in areas designated as floodways since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris potential projectiles and erosion potential the following provisions shall apply 1 encroachments are prohibited including fill new construction substantial improvements and other development unless certification by a professional registered engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge 2 if subsection 1 of this section is satisfied all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction
