the copy to be signed by the governor the meeting adjourned subject to the call of the chairman ____________ state of michigan office of the governor lansing george romney governor i hereby approve the foregoing charter of the city of owosso michigan george romney governor of the state of michigan dated   am ____________ statement of the charter commission to the people of owosso in accordance with your instructions of  when you voted for charter revision we have drafted a revised charter for the city of owosso embodying a change in form of government and herewith submit it for your consideration effort was made to have the charter brief and clear to give the city every permitted home rule power to limit rigidly those powers it seems should be limited to leave flexibility in the exercise of powers where flexibility appeared advantageous the plan of government is simple and logical responsibility is clearly fixed at every point and where responsibility is placed proportionate authority is granted to facilitate clear understanding of the proposed charter we summarize as follows its more important provisions governmental structure the people elect a council of seven members upon whom is placed the responsibility of governing the city the council appoints a city manager who is the chief administrative officer of the city government under the council and upon whom is placed the responsibility for efficient operation of the administrative service other officials appointed or confirmed by the council are members of the board of review the citys representatives on the board of supervisors a mayor a city clerk treasurer assessor and other needed officers the mayor chosen from the councils membership serves as presiding officer of the council and as ceremonial head of the city government the duties of the council are chiefly legislative and policy determining the compensation of its members is nominal since they are not administrative officers under this charter the city manager is given adequate authority including appointment and removal of administrative officers subject to council approval and review the council is free to hire the best city manager available paying such reasonable salary as his capabilities command and is equally free to dismiss him at any time if not satisfied with his performance the field from which he may be chosen is defined and while he need not be a resident of the city or the state at the time he is selected he must become a resident within a reasonable time municipal court our present municipal court is continued unchanged and may handle cases up to $1000 the municipal judge is elected by the people elections regular nonpartisan city elections are held the first tuesday in april of each even numbered year candidates for councilmen seek office by petition or a petition may be filed by friends if more than twice the number of candidates file than there are persons to be elected to an office that is more than 2 for municipal judge or more than 8 for the office of councilman a primary election is held to reduce the number to 2 and 8 respectively so that each person elected to a city office shall have received a clear majority of the votes cast for his office the terms of councilmen are so arranged that a majority of council must be elected every two years financetaxationbonds greatest care was taken in preparing the provisions relating to finance taxation and the issuance of bonds so that the city might possess all rightful powers but with the peoples interest carefully safeguarded authority to issue bonds without the approval of threefifths of the electors is strictly limited by state law not because we believe it the ultimate answer to the vexations vexatious taxation problem but rather because it has so long been established in the existing charter we have included in this new charter the fifteenmill limitation on taxation contained in the present charter the charter commission feels that any change in the tax limitation should be by a direct vote of the people and should not be a part of a package in a new charter budget under the proposed charter an itemized annual budget prepared by the city manager shall be considered at a public hearing after notice to the public and filing at the city library and will be passed upon finally by the council under the existing form of government in which the commissioners are administrators as well as legislators a budget is worked out by the mayor and each commissioner has his attention on his own department and functions under the proposed charter the city manager will present a correlated budget and the council will review and adopt it on the basis of a city wide and overall interest retirementspensions it is the intent of the chapter on retirements and pensions to preserve the present pension plans of the city this has been done by writing the present plans into the charter the only changes in the pension plan are changes in wording to make it conform to the style of the charter and those recommended by the actuary to conform to modern practice minor changes had to be made to comply with the new state constitution the citys consulting actuary advises the charter commission that these changes do not change the rights of employees in a pension for their years of work for the city as they have existed in the past but rather strengthen and clarify these rights civil service the charter commission has protected every appointive officer and employee of the city in the position held by him to this purpose both groups are protected by the availability of public hearings at their request if there has been any unmerited discharge demotion or disciplinary action the council is required to adopt a civil service plan for all employees within one year after the effective date of the charter public utilitiesfranchises every care was taken to safeguard fully the peoples rights in the granting of public utility franchises and at the same time to avoid such drastic restrictions as might work to the citys disadvantage no irrevocable franchise may be granted except by a 34 vote of the people and exclusive franchises are prohibited thirty years is fixed as the maximum life of a franchise but the council and the people may limit them to any shorter terms as circumstances at the time may dictate because the right of municipal ownership of public utilities is satisfactorily provided by state law and is among the powers vested in the city it was not repeated in detail in this charter except by a general reference thereto initiativereferendumrecall the initiative the referendum and the recall are preserved exercise of any of these rights is cumbersome and costly but there always is a possibility that at some time resort to one or another of them may be justifiable open recordspublic meetings in the proposed charter the early american town meeting rights are preserved all city records are open to public inspection the public may attend and voice opinions at both special and regular council meetings which must be held at a time and place convenient to the public new state constitution in the drafting of this charter the charter commission has been aware of the adoption of the new michigan constitution in so far as the constitution itself affects the provisions of city charters the charter commission has endeavored to comply with its provisions the charter commission is and has been aware of the fact that implementing legislation has been passed and will be required to make such constitution fully effective in so far as such implementing legislation is known and could be foreseen by the charter commission from information available to it every effort has been made to make this charter conform thereto or to include the intent and purposes thereof conclusion your charter commission has followed as much as possible the excellent work of the 1956 charter commission we do however feel that we have improved the instrument and brought it into line with the progress in local government ideas and statutory requirements of the mid1960s you are requested to pass judgment upon this proposed new charter in its entirety and not allow disapproval of some particular provision to cause rejection of the whole perfection is not claimed but we are convinced this charter offers the best governmental machinery that has been evolved for a city of owossos size and needs should any provision of the charter fail to live up to the expectations of the people and of the charter commission the procedure for amending the charter is relatively simple and democratic amendments to this charter may be presented by the council or by popular petition and are voted by the people themselves under our michigan law your thoughtful consideration to the provisions of this charter is requested by your charter commission and your vote of approval is recommended at the
