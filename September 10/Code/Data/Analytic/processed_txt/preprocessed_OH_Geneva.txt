national categorical pretreatment standards users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 cfr subchapter n parts 405471 awhere a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the superintendent may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with d and e of this section bwhen the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the superintendent may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users cwhen wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the superintendent shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr 4036e dwhen a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the superintendent the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth below 1to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must aemploy or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  bcurrently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  cprovide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  dnot have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and ehave consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits ethe superintendent may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the superintendent note when converting such limits to concentration limits the superintendent will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by see 40 cfr 4036d in addition the superintendent will document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass limits or vice versa and make this information publicly available see 40 cfr 4036c7 fonce included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived gmany categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or 4day average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation hany industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the superintendent within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know

purpose it is the intent of this section to allow for and regulate the establishment of home occupations in residential neighborhoods the city of geneva recognizes the need for some citizens to use

geneva is attempting to guarantee to all residents freedom from excessive noise excessive traffic nuisance fire hazard and other possible effects of commercial uses being conducted in residential areas in essence the objective of a home occupation permit is to allow a limited number of commercialtype activities in a residential area only to the extent that neighbors or passersby will not be aware by outward appearance of the activity in practice a home occupation permit gives the permittee the legal right to use his or her residence for business telecommunications and as a business mailing address but not to the extent that pedestrian and vehicular traffic are generated bhome occupation defined as used in this section home occupation means an occupation that is incidental to the primary use of the residential dwelling unit as a residence a home occupation permit may only be granted to the property owner by the planning commission provided that he or she resides at the property the commission may specify the terms conditions extent and duration as well as provide a means for the revocation and renewal of home occupation permits crequired conditions 1no person other
