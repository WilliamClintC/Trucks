preliminary unit  comparative table of specials codified ordinances of white oak pennsylvania  part one  administrative three  business and taxation five  traffic seven  general offenses nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  health and sanitation thirteen  planning and zoning fifteen  fire prevention seventeen  building and housing s note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles articles and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code article and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the article number is 305 or the 5th article within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and article numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the article number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the article number is 113 or the 13th article within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and articles initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation articles are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that

finds that 1stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens public health and safety by causing decreased infiltration of rainwater and increased runoff flows and velocities which overtax the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers and greatly increases the cost of the public to manage stormwater 2inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating streams flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loading such as sediments nutrients heavy metal and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge 3a program of stormwater management including reasonable regulations of land development and redevelopment causing loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the borough of white oak and all the people of the commonwealth of pennsylvania their resources and the environment 4stormwater can be an important water resources by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality 5public addressing stormwater education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater 6federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination systems npdes 7nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the borough of white oak

practices  alternative approach for managing stormwater runoff natural hydrologic conditions may e altered radically by poorly planned development practices such as introducing unneeded impervious surfaces destroying existing drainage swales constructing unnecessary storm sewers and changing local topography a traditional drainage approach of development has been to remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a detention basin this approach leads ultimately to the degradation of water quality as well as expenditure of additional resources for detaining and managing concentrated runoff at some downstream locations the recommended alternative approach is to promote practices that will minimize post development runoff rates and volumes which will minimize needs for artificial conveyance and storage facilities to simulate predevelopment hydrologic conditions forced infiltration is often necessary to offset the loss of infiltration by creation of impervious surfaces the ability of the ground to infiltrate depends upon the soil types and its conditions preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful alternative site design considerations site design practices include preserving natural drainage features minimizing impervious surface area reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces and protecting natural depression storage a welldesigned site will contain a mix of all those features the following describes various techniques to achieve the alternative approach preserving natural drainage features protecting natural drainage features particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels is desirable because of their ability to infiltrate and attenuate flows and to filter pollutants however this objective is often not accomplished in land development in fact commonly held drainage philosophy encourages just the opposite patter  streets and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in the natural headwater alleys and swales thereby replacing natural drainage functions with a completely impervious system as a result runoff and pollutants generated from impervious surfaces flow directly into storm sewers with no opportunity for attenuation infiltration or filtration developments designed to fit site topography also minimizes the amount of grading on site protecting natural depression storage areas depressional storage areas have no surface outlet or drain very slowly following a storm event they can be commonly seen as ponded areas in farm fields during the wet season or after large runoff events traditional development practices eliminate these depressions by filling or draining thereby obliterating their ability to reduce surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants the volume and releaserate characteristics of depressions should be protected in the design of the development site the depressions can be protected by simply avoiding the depression or by incorporating its storage as additional capacity in required detention facilities avoiding introduction of impervious areas careful site planning should consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible building footprints sidewalks driveways and other features producing impervious surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces impervious surfaces are significantly less of a problem if they are not directly connected to an impervious conveyance system such as storm sewer two basic ways to reduce hydraulic connectivity are routing of roof runoff over lawns and reducing the use of storm sewers site grading should promote increasing travel times of stormwater runoff and should help reduce concentration of runoff to a single point in the development routing roof runoff over lawns roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns in most site designs the practice discourages direct connections of downspouts to storm sewers or parking lots the practice also discourages sloping driveways and parking lots to the street by routing roof drains and crowing the driveway to run off to the lawn the lawn is essentially used as a filter strip reducing the use of storm sewers by reducing use of storm sewers for draining streets parking lots and back yards the potential for accelerating runoff from the development can be greatly reduced the practice requires greater use of swales and may not be practical for some development sites especially if there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a reasonable time the practice requires educating local citizens and public works officials who expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event reducing street widths street widths can be reduced by either eliminating onstreet parking or by reducing roadway widths municipal planners and traffic designers should encourage narrower neighborhood streets which ultimately could lower maintenance limiting sidewalks to one side of the street a sidewalk on one side of the street may suffice in lowtraffic neighborhoods the lost sidewalk could be replaced with bicyclerecreational trails that follow backoflot lines where appropriate backyard trails should be constructed using pervious materials using permeable paving materials these materials include permeable interlocking concrete paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete such materials should be considered as alternatives as conventional pavement surfaces especially for low use surfaces such as driveways overflow parking lots and emergency access roads reducing building setbacks reducing building setbacks reduces driveway and entry walks and is most readily accomplished along lowtraffic streets where traffic noise is not a problem constructing cluster developments cluster developments can also reduce the amount of impervious area for a given number of lots the biggest savings is in street length which also will reduce costs of the development cluster development clusters the construction activity onto less sensitive areas without substantially affecting the gross density of development in summary a careful consideration of the existing topography and implementation of a combination of the above mentioned techniques may avoid construction of costly stormwater control measurers other benefits include reduced potential of downstream flooding water quality degradation of receiving streamswater bodies and enhancement of aesthetics and reduction of development costs beneficial results include more stable baseflows in receiving streams improved groundwater recharge reduced flood flows reduced pollutant loads and reduces costs for conveyance and storage  appendix b stormwater best management

storage may be substituted for required onsite retention provided that 1proper legal arrangements are executed  2the offsite facility is approved by the engineer  and 3no problems are created between the development site and the off site storage facility cno harm option where the applicant proposes to increase the pre development maximum rate of runoff for the site then the applicant is required to demonstrate that the proposed storm water management system will not result in any harm or adverse effects to downstream areas all plans and computations must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer with expertise in storm water management the procedure for utilizing the noharm option and the information to be included is as follows 1determine discharge control values at all points of interest between the proposed development site and the base of the watershed 2using the scs tr55 hydrograph method and the existing watershed land use and soils maps that may be obtained from allegheny county compute the two ten and one hundred year storm predevelopment discharge values at the point of discharge from the site and at all points of interest between the site and the base of watershed the engineer may identify additional points of interest where there are existing obstructions or known problems or other points may be identified during the course of the plan review process or applicants own engineering evaluations 3compare the predevelopment discharge values computed by the applicant to the discharge values shown in available watershed studies or independent studies if the applicants values are plus or minus twenty percent 20% of the comparison values the applicants values are acceptable and may be used for all further evaluations and comparisons this computation establishes for the applicant the discharge values downstream that must not be exceeded after development 4using the scs tr55 method compute the postdevelopment discharges for the two ten and one hundred year storms for the same locations used above the calculations of the postdevelopment discharges should include the proposed on and offsite storm water management controls proposed by the applicant when this analysis indicates that downstream improvements are feasible the developer may make downstream improvements in lieu of providing onsite detention with the approval of council affected landowners and the department of environmental resources der if applicable 5when the computed postdevelopment discharges for the two ten and one hundred year storms at all points of interest do not exceed the computed predevelopment discharges at the same points then the applicant shall have demonstrated within reasonable limits that no harm or adverse effects will
