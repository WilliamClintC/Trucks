development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and floodreduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of girard borough and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns  accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation  destroying aquatic habitat  and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge d stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater

layout of dwellings and by the conservation and more efficient use of open space ancillary to said dwellings so that greater opportunities for better housing and recreation may extend to all citizens and residents of this borough and in order to encourage a more efficient use of land and of public services and to reflect changes in the technology of land development so that economies secured may inure to the benefit of those who need homes and in aid of these purposes to provide a procedure which can relate the type design and layout of residential development to the particular site and the particular demand for housing existing at the time of development in a manner consistent with preservation of the property values within existing residential areas and to insure that the increased
