adverse impact regardless of the nature of the existing environment  3several marginal impacts when considered together may result in a significant adverse impact  4for some proposals it may be impossible to forecast the environmental impacts with precision often because some variables cannot be predicted or values cannot be quantified  5a proposal may to a significant degree aadversely

and shall inform decisionmakers and the public of reasonable alternatives including mitigation measures that would avoid or minimize adverse impacts or enhance environmental quality cenvironmental impact statements shall be concise clear and to the point and shall be supported by the necessary environmental analysis the purpose of an eis is best served by short documents containing summaries of or reference to technical data and by avoiding excessively detailed and overly technical information the volume of an eis does not bear on its adequacy large documents may even hinder the decisionmaking process dthe eis process enables government agencies and interested citizens to review and comment on proposed government actions including government approval of private projects and their environmental effects this process is intended to assist the agencies and applicants to improve their plans and decisions and to encourage the resolution of potential concerns or problems prior to issuing a final statement an environmental impact statement is more than a disclosure document it shall be used by agency officials in conjunction with other relevant materials and considerations to plan actions and make decisions  1984  preparation of eis environmental impact statements shall be prepared as follows aenvironmental impact statements shall be readable reports which allow the reader to understand the most significant and vital information concerning the proposed action alternatives and impacts without turning to other documents beiss need analyze only the reasonable

be supplemented by appendices reports or other documents in the agencys record hagencies shall prepare eiss concurrently with and coordinated with environmental studies and related surveys that may be required for the proposal under other laws when feasible ithe range of alternative courses of action discussed in eiss shall encompass those to be considered by the decisionmaker jeiss shall serve as

environmental impact statement as close as possible to the time the agency is developing or is presented with a proposal so that preparation can be completed in time for the final statement to be included in appropriate recommendations or reports on the proposal the statement shall be prepared early enough so it can serve practically as an important contribution to the decisionmaking process and will not be used to rationalize or justify decisions already made eiss may be phased in appropriate situations  1984  scoping athe lead agency shall narrow the scope of every eis to the probable significant adverse impacts and reasonable alternatives including mitigation measures for example if there are only two or three significant impacts or alternatives the eis shall be focused on those

comments agencies affected tribes and the public shall be allowed twentyone 21 days from the date of issuance of the ds in which to comment unless expanded scoping is used the date of issuance for a

the eis where feasible cagencies affected tribes and the public should comment promptly and as specifically as permitted by the details available on the proposal dmeetings or scoping documents including notices that the scope has been revised may be used but are not required the lead agency shall integrate the scoping process with its existing planning and decisionmaking process in order to avoid duplication and delay ethe lead agency shall revise the scope of an eis if substantial changes are made later in the proposal or if significant new circumstances or information arise that bear on the proposal and its significant impacts fdeis shall be prepared according to the scope decided upon by the lead agency in its scoping process geis preparation may begin during scoping hthe lead

reports background data adopted documents and materials incorporated by reference for this eis if any  12the cost to the public for a copy of the eis ctable of contents 1the table of contents should list if possible any documents which are appended adopted or serve as technical reports for this eis but need not list each comment letter 2the table of contents may include the list of elements of the environment indicating those elements or portions of elements which do not involve significant impacts dsummary the eis shall summarize the contents of the statement and shall not merely be an expanded table of contents the summary shall briefly state the proposals objectives specifying the purpose and need to which the proposal is responding the major conclusions significant areas of controversy and uncertainty if any and the issues to be resolved including the environmental choices to be made among alternative courses of action and the effectiveness of mitigation measures the summary need not mention every subject discussed in the eis but shall include a summary of the proposal impacts alternatives mitigation measures and significant adverse impacts that cannot be mitigated the summary shall state when the eis is part of a phased review if known or the lead agency is relying on prior or future environmental review which should be generally identified the lead agency shall make the summary sufficiently broad to be useful to the other agencies with jurisdiction ealternatives including the proposed action 1this section of the eis describes and presents the proposal or preferred alternative if one or more exists and alternative courses of action 2reasonable alternatives shall include actions that could feasibly attain or approximate a proposals objectives but at a lower environmental cost or decreased level of environmental degradation athe word reasonable is intended to limit the number and range of alternatives as well as the amount of detailed analysis for each alternative bthe noaction alternative shall be evaluated and compared to other alternatives creasonable alternatives may be those over which an agency with jurisdiction has authority to control impacts either directly or indirectly of mitigation measures 3this section of the eis shall adescribe the objectives proponents and principal features of reasonable alternatives include the proposed action including mitigation measures that are part of the proposal  bdescribe the location of the alternatives including the proposed action so that a lay person can understand it include a map street address if any and legal description unless long or in metes and bounds  cidentify any phases of the proposal their timing and previous or future environmental analysis on this or related proposals if known  dtailor the level of detail of descriptions to the significance of environmental impacts the lead agency should retain any detailed engineering drawings and technical data that have been submitted in agency files and make them available on request  edevote sufficiently detailed analysis to each reasonable alternative to permit a comparative evaluation of the alternatives including the proposed action the amount of space devoted to each alternative may vary one alternative including the proposed action may be used as a benchmark for comparing alternatives the eis may indicate the main reasons for eliminating alternatives from detailed study fpresent a comparison of the environmental impacts of the reasonable alternatives and include the no action alternative although graphics may be helpful a matrix or chart is not required a range of alternatives or a few representative alternatives rather than every possible reasonable variation may be discussed gdiscuss the benefits and disadvantages of reserving for some future time the implementation of the proposal as compared with possible approval at this time the agency perspective should be that each generation is in effect a trustee of the environment for succeeding generations particular attention should be given to the possibility of foreclosing future options by implementing the proposal 4when a proposal is for a private project on a specific site the lead agency shall be required to evaluate only the no action alternative plus other reasonable alternatives for achieving the proposals objective on the same site this subsection shall not apply when the proposal includes a rezone unless the rezone is for a use allowed in an existing comprehensive plan that was adopted after review under sepa further alternative sites may be evaluated if other locations for the type of proposed use have not been included or considered in existing planning or zoning documents faffected environment significant impacts and mitigation measures 1this section of the eis shall describe the existing environment that will be affected by the proposal analyze significant impacts of alternatives including the proposed action and discuss reasonable mitigation measures that would significantly mitigate these impacts elements of the environment that are not significantly affected need not be discussed separate sections are not required for each subject 2general requirements for this section of the eis athis section shall be written in a nontechnical manner which is easily understandable to lay persons whenever possible with the discussion commensurate with the importance of the impacts only significant impacts must be discussed  other impacts may be discussed balthough the lead agency should discuss the affected environment environmental impacts and other mitigation measures together for each element of the environment where there is a significant impact the responsible official shall have the flexibility to organize this section in any manner useful to decisionmakers and the public cthis subsection is not intended to duplicate the analysis in subsection e of this section and shall avoid doing so to the fullest extent possible 3this section of the eis shall asuccinctly describe the principal features of the environment that would be affected or created by the alternatives including the proposal under consideration inventories of species should be avoided although rare threatened or endangered species should be indicated  bdescribe and discuss significant impacts that will narrow the range or degree of beneficial uses of the environment or pose longterm risks to human health or the environment such as storage handling or disposal of toxic or hazardous material  cclearly indicate those mitigation measures not described in the previous section as part of the proposal or alternatives if any that could be implemented or might be required as well as those if any that agencies or applicants are committed to implement  dindicate what the intended environmental benefits of mitigation measures are for significant impacts and may discuss their technical feasibility and economic practicability if there is concern about whether a mitigation measure is capable of being accomplished the eis need not analyze mitigation measures in detail unless they involve substantial changes to the proposal causing significant adverse impacts or new information regarding impacts and those measures will not be subsequently analyzed under sepa an eis may briefly mention nonsignificant impacts or mitigation measures to satisfy other environmental review laws or requirements covered in the same documents esummarize significant adverse impacts that cannot or will not be mitigated 4this section shall incorporate when appropriate aa summary of existing plans for example land use and shoreline plans and zoning regulations applicable to the proposal and how the proposal is consistent and inconsistent with them  benergy requirements and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures including more efficient use of energy such as insulating as well as the use of alternate and renewable energy resources  cnatural or depletable resource requirements and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures  durban quality historic and cultural resources and the design of the built environment including the reuse and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures 5significant impacts on both the natural environment and the built environment must be analyzed if relevant this involves impacts upon and the quality of the physical surroundings whether they are in wild rural or urban areas discussion of significant impacts shall include the cost of and effects on public services such as utilities roads fire and police protection that may result from a proposal eiss shall also discuss significant environmental impacts upon land and shoreline use which includes housing physical blight and significant impacts of projected population on environmental resources as specified by rcw 4321c1101 d and f as listed in nbmc  gappendices comment letters and responses shall be circulated with the feis technical reports and supporting documents need not be circulated with an eis but shall be readily available to agencies and the public during the comment period hthe lead agency may include in an eis or appendix the analysis of any impact relevant to the agencys decision whether or not environmental the inclusion of such analysis may be based upon comments received during the scoping process the provision for combining documents may be used the eis shall comply with the format requirements of this part the decision whether to include such information and the adequacy of any such additional analysis shall not be used in determining whether an eis meets the requirements of sepa  1984  contents of eis on nonproject proposals athe lead agency shall have more flexibility in preparing eiss on nonproject proposals because there is normally less detailed information available on their environmental impacts and on any subsequent project proposals the eis may be combined with other planning documents bthe lead agency shall discuss impacts and alternatives in the level of detail appropriate to the scope of the nonproject proposal and to the level of planning for the proposal alternatives should be emphasized in particular agencies are encouraged to describe the proposal in terms of alternative means of accomplishing a stated objective alternatives including the proposed action should be analyzed at a roughly comparable level of detail sufficient to evaluate their comparative merits this does not require devoting the same number of pages in an eis to each alternative cif the nonproject proposal concerns a specific geographic area sitespecific analyses are not required but may be included for areas of specific concern the eis should identify subsequent actions that would be undertaken by other agencies as a result of the nonproject proposal such as transportation and utility systems dthe eiss discussion of alternatives for a comprehensive plan community plan or other areawide zoning or for shoreline or land use plans shall be limited to a general discussion of the impacts of alternate proposals for policies contained in such plans for land use or shoreline designations and for implementation measures the lead agency is not required under sepa to examine all conceivable policies designations or implementation measures but should cover a range of such topics the eis content may be limited to a discussion of alternatives which have been formally proposed or which are while not formally proposed reasonably related to the proposed action  1984  eis contents when prior nonproject eis athe provisions for phased review and use of existing environmental documents apply to eiss on nonproject proposals ba nonproject proposal may be approved based on an eis assessing its broad impacts when a project is then proposed that is consistent with the approved nonproject action the eis on such a project shall focus on the impacts and alternatives including mitigation measures specific to the subsequent project and not analyzed in the nonproject eis the scope shall be limited accordingly procedures for use of existing documents shall be used as appropriate cwhen preparing a project eis under the preceding subsection the lead agency shall review the nonproject eis to ensure that the analysis is valid when applied to the current proposal knowledge and technology if it is not valid the analysis

order to evaluate proposed actions alternatives or environmental impacts the proposals may be the same as or different than those analyzed in the existing documents bother agencies acting on the same proposal shall use an environmental document unchanged except in the following cases 1for dnss an agency with jurisdiction is dissatisfied with the dns in which case it may assure lead agency status  2for dnss and eiss preparation of a new threshold determination or supplemental eis is required if there are asubstantial changes to a proposal so that the proposal is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts or lack of significant adverse impacts if a ds is being withdrawn or bnew information indicating a proposals probable significant adverse environmental impacts this includes discovery of misrepresentation or lack of material disclosure a new threshold determination or seis is not required if probable significant adverse environmental impacts are covered by the range of alternatives and impacts analyzed in the existing environmental documents  3for eiss the agency concludes that its written comments on the deis warrant additional discussion for purposes of its action than that found in the lead agencys feis in which case the agency may prepare a supplemental eis at its own expense cexisting documents may be used for a proposal by employing one or more of the following methods 1adoption where an agency may use all or part of an existing environmental document to meet its responsibilities under sepa agencies acting on the same proposal for which an environmental document was prepared are not required to adopt the document  or 2incorporation by reference where an agency preparing an environmental document includes all or part of an existing document by reference  3an addendum that adds analyses or information about a proposal but does not substantially change the analysis of significant impacts and alternatives in the existing environmental document  4preparation of a seis if there are asubstantial changes so that the proposal is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts or bnew information indicating a

follows athe agency shall send copies of the adoption notice to the department of ecology to agencies with jurisdiction to cities in which the proposal will be implemented and to local agencies or political subdivisions whose public services would be changed as a result of implementation of the proposal bthe agency is encouraged to send the adoption notice to persons or organizations that have expressed an interest in the proposal or are known by the agency to have an interest in the type of proposal being considered or the lead agency should announce the adoption in agency newsletters or

of the physical chemical or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former wetland reestablishment results in a gain in wetland acres and functions examples of such activities could include removing fill material plugging ditches breaking drain tiles and the like  and iirehabilitation the manipulation of the physical chemical or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of repairing natural or historic functions of a degraded wetland rehabilitation results in a gain in wetland function but does not result in a gain in wetland acres examples of such activities could involve breaching a dike to reconnect wetlands to a floodplain or returning tidal influence to a wetland and the like bestablishment creation the manipulation of the physical chemical or biological characteristics of a site to develop a wetland on an upland or deepwater site where a wetland did not previously exist establishment results in a gain in wetland acres activities typically involve excavation of upland soils to elevations that will produce a wetland hydroperiod create hydric soils and support the growth of hydrophytic plant species iif a site is not available for wetland restoration to compensate for expected wetland andor buffer impacts the director may authorize creation of a wetland andor buffer upon demonstration by the applicants qualified wetland professional that athe hydrology and soil conditions at the proposed mitigation site are conducive for sustaining the proposed wetland and that creation of a wetland at the site will not likely cause hydrologic problems elsewhere  badjacent land uses and site conditions do not jeopardize the viability of the proposed wetland andor buffer eg due to the presence of invasive plants or noxious weeds stormwater runoff noise light or other impacts  and cthe proposed wetland andor buffer will eventually be selfsustaining with little or no longterm maintenance cenhancement the manipulation of the physical chemical or biological characteristics of a wetland site to heighten intensify or improve specific functions or to change the growth stage or composition of the vegetation present enhancement is undertaken for specified purposes such as water quality improvement floodwater retention or wildlife habitat enhancement results in a change in some wetland

shifts in location of stream channels figure 5 special flood hazard map2 identifies channel migration zones in the north bend area the city of north bend does not regulate these channel migration zone areas the citys decision not to regulate the channel migration zones is based on the following facts the channel migration zones of the middle fork of the snoqualmie river are identified as avulsion hazard channel migration areas associated with catastrophic flooding events by the 1996 king county three forks snoqualmie river channel migration study as such the potential channel migration would only occur in conjunction with a major flood event in 200 the flood insurance rate map was revised to incorporate and regulate the same general channel migration areas as floodways the flood regulations provide substantially similar health and safety protection for the avulsion hazard channel migration areas and the creation of duplicate overlapping regulatory standards was not found to be in the best public interest by the city council the majority of the existing silver creek neighborhood affected by the channel migration zones of the middle fork of the snoqualmie river is already developed in public open space ownership or protected by existing public roadways that will likely be restored if ever damaged by a major flood event including a channel migration by avulsion the remaining large parcels of land that may be developed in the silver creek neighborhood are likely to be reviewed under the sepa process and any channel migration zones of the middle fork of the snoqualmie river identified as avulsion hazard channel migration areas that are not regulated by the flood regulations can be addressed and mitigated in the sepa process the channel migration zones of the south fork of the snoqualmie river are identified as lateral migration hazard areas in the 1996 king county three forks snoqualmie river channel migration study the areas at risk are wholly located in the tollgate farm public open space purchased in part to protect them from development because of the risk associated with the critical areas on the property as with the silver creek residential areas the floodways on the 2005 firm cover similar areas to the channel migration areas and if any development was proposed on the public open space it likely would be reviewed under the

dimensional standards clearing grading landscaping and integrated management practices imps lid images and examples  purpose the city of north bend is currently experiencing substantial growth this growth will place demands on our community transportation system and ecosystems as native landscapes transition into built environments the infrastructure necessary to support the built environment will increase the impervious surface coverage as roads parking areas sidewalks and rooftops are constructed these changes will reduce disrupt or eliminate native vegetation upper soil layers shallow

environment the city intends to guide new development and redevelopment towards environmentally and economically sustainable approaches exh a part 2016 exh a part 2009  definitions integrated management practices are tools used in low impact development lid projects for water quality treatment and flow control the controls are integrated throughout the project and provide a landscape amenity with a stormwater treatment and flow control function these features are intended to mimic or model nature and the predevelopment hydrology rain garden or bioretention cell means an engineered and vegetated small depression in ground that allows stormwater runoff directed from impervious areas such as roofs streets parking areas sidewalks driveways walkways and compacted gravel areas to be treated and infiltrate near the source native plants are used within rain gardens because they are tolerant to local climate soils and water conditions and do not require fertilizers water filters soil layers before entering the groundwater system mimicking natural conditions plant and small tree root systems enhance infiltration moisture redistribution and diverse microbial populations necessary for biofiltration rain gardens may or may not have an underdrain and are not designed as a conveyance system significant tree means any evergreen tree of at least 15 inches dbh and any deciduous tree other than red alder holly poplar and cottonwood trees at least 12 inches dbh red alder holly poplar cottonwood and other invasive trees of any size are not considered significant trees  exh a part 2016 exh a part 2009  low impact development low impact development lid is a stormwater management approach with a basic principle that is modeled after nature manage rainfall and stormwater runoff at the source using decentralized smallscale controls the goal of low impact development is to mimic a sites predevelopment hydrology as much as practical by using design techniques that infiltrate filter store recharge evaporate and detain runoff close to its source techniques are based on the premise that stormwater management should not be seen as stormwater disposal instead of capturing conveying managing and treating stormwater in large costly endofpipe facilities located at the bottom of drainage areas lid addresses stormwater costeffective landscape features located at the lot and tract level these landscape features known as integrated management practices imps are the building blocks of lid almost all components of the urban environment have the potential to serve as an imp these include open spaces rooftops streetscapes parking lots sidewalks landscape strips and medians lid is a versatile approach that can be applied equally well to new development urban retrofits and redevelopment projects the most suitable lid approaches may vary from site to site due to varying surface and subsurface geology topography vegetation and site configuration exh a part 2016 exh a part 2009  benefits the benefits of low impact development include but are not limited to the following alid techniques protect the environment by removing pollutants from stormwater reducing the overall volume of stormwater managing high storm flows and replenishing streams wetlands and aquifers blid techniques help to reduce flooding and protect property reducing impervious surfaces increasing vegetation and dispersing and infiltrating stormwater result in less runoff this reduces the likelihood of flooding from major storm events clid techniques help to protect human health by more effectively removing pollutants from stormwater untreated stormwater can be unsafe for people to drink or swim in dlid techniques help to protect drinking water supplies by ensuring that rainfall infiltrates into the existing soils where it can recharge aquifers rather than being treated as a waste and discharged to marine waters elid techniques provide costeffective alternatives to systems upgrades in many cases lid systems such as bioretention are less expensive to use than costly stormwater vaults or landconsuming stormwater retention and storage ponds flid techniques improve the appearance and aesthetics of communities lid projects leave more trees and plants and have less impervious surfaces resulting in greener developments and communities glid techniques can increase public safety one hallmark of lid is safer streets studies show that when vehicle traffic is slowed there are fewer pedestrian accidents lid techniques that serve to also slow traffic include narrower streets and integrated rain gardens doubling as traffic calming features hlid techniques help to preserve a green and environmentally sustainable north bend with a small town rural character

whichever is greater  for other eligible support structures it increases the height of the structure by more than 10 percent or more than 10 feet whichever is greater changes in height should be measured from the original support structure in cases where deployments are or will be separated horizontally such as on buildings rooftops  in other circumstances changes in height should be measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were approved prior to the passage of the spectrum act  bfor towers other than towers in the public rightsofway it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower more than 20 feet or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance whichever is greater  for other eligible support structures it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than six feet  cfor any eligible support structure it involves installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved but not to exceed four cabinets  or for towers in the public rightsofway and base stations it involves installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground if there are no preexisting ground cabinets associated with the structure or else involves installation of ground cabinets that are more than 10 percent larger in height or overall volume than any other ground cabinets associated with the

exposes the earths surface on the site or results in the loss of trees or forested areas 7clearing and grading permit means the written permission of the city to the applicant to proceed with the act of clearing grading filling andor drainage which could disturb the land surface 8cluster means a group of three or more trees with overlapping or touching crowns 9critical root zone or crz the critical root zone of a tree is established on the basis of the trunk diameter the crz is a circular area which has a radius of 12 inches to every inch diameter of trunk measured at four and onehalf feet above grade root systems will vary both in depth and spread depending on size of tree soils water table species and other factors however this crz description is generally accepted in the tree industry protecting this entire area should result in no adverse impact to the tree the below crz drawing has been further differentiated into the perimeter pcrz and icrz to help define potential impact and required post care generally the full pcrz is considered the optimum amount of root protection to a tree as one encroaches into the pcrz but not into the interior crz the greater post care the tree would require to remain alive and stable the interior crz is half the radius of the full pcrz disturbance into the icrz could destabilize or cause the tree to decline image the absolute maximum disturbance allowed should leave the interior crz undisturbed if the tree is to have any chance of survival this interior crz would approximately equal the size of a root ball needed to
