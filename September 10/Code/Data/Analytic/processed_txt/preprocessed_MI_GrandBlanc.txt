if my intended use is not listed as a principal use permitted or special land use if your proposed use is not listed as either a permitted use or a special land use on your property you have several options including # find an alternative use for your property which is permitted or find a site in the city or surrounding township which is properly zoned for your intended use # request the city rezone the property which requires appearances before both the planning commission and the city council with at least one public hearing the zoning criteria which the planning commission references in reviewing your rezoning request  one criteria is that the rezoning be consistent with the future land use map in the grand blanc community master plan even if the long range future land use map indicates your intended use the city must also determine the appropriateness of the timing for the zoning change # if your use is not listed anywhere in the zoningordinance you could request that the planning commission consider your intended use based on the determination of similar uses as explained in under this process the planning commission determines the appropriate districts for the intended use based on similarity to other uses listed the board of zoning appeals has final authority if you disagree with the planning commissions interpretation # request the city add your proposed use either as a permitted use or a special land use to the zoning district noteas a policy the city of grand blanc does not consider use variances # the city of grand blanc has little vacant buildable

proper zoning is in place  once proper zoning is in place there are several factors to consider during the early stages of project planning the list below highlights some of the more important features o natural features the city strives to maximize preservation of existing mature woodlands with quality species particularly oak hickory beech ash andmaples  or to preserve areas in their natural state o wetlands the city does not have a local wetlands ordinance however the city tries to promote compliance with themichiganwetlands protection act and to encourage developers to protect all wetlands regardless of size if your site contains possiblemdnrregulatedwetlands usually those over 5 acres select a recognized wetland consultant to help determine the location issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy may be contingent on submittal of a mdnr wetland permit o topography the city generally requires site development which complements existing topography the a plan illustrating topography before and after development at two foot contour intervals with spot elevations in pavement areas o driveways the citys policy is to minimize the number of driveways the location of driveways in relation to other driveways and spacing from intersections is considered during site plan review your survey should illustrate existing driveways and roads within 100 feet of the edge of your property sharing of driveways or connecting sites roads or service drives is encouragedhigh traffic generating sites and larger scale projects should consider the relationship of the site to existing and potential traffic signals o traffic or environmental impact studies if your project is expected to generate a significant amount of traffic or is located on a congested or accident prone street section you may be required to submit a traffic impact study prepared by a qualified engineer or planner certain types of projects require an impact assessment as part of the site plan review package the site plan review section includes a point system used by the city to determine the need to prepare an environmental assessment o utilities information on water sanitary
