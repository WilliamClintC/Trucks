continuous sound levels or motor vehicle sound levels shall be measured using the slowtimeweighting 3 all measurements shall be rounded to the nearest whole decibel 4 all measurements shall be corrected for the ambient as follows a timevarying sound when making measurements of timevarying sounds the measuring official shall observe the meter rise to its maximum while he hears the sound rise to a maximum for the measurement to be valid 1 case 1 when the difference in any given fiveminute period between the maximum level and the minimum level is 11 db or more then the offending sound level shall be taken to be the maximum level and no correction for the ambient is required 2 case 2 when the difference between the maximum level and the minimum level in any fiveminute period is between 3 db and 10 db then the noise sound level plus the ambient shall be taken to be the maximum level the ambient shall be determined in accordance with subsection b4b of this section the maximum level which is the noise sound level plus ambient shall be corrected to noise sound level alone using table iv in subsection b4b4 of this section 3 case 3 when the difference in any given fiveminute period between the maximum level and the minimum level is less than 3 db then the noise sound level is too near to the ambient and no violation is demonstrated b ambient sound level when required the ambient sound level alone shall be determined using one of the following four methods in hierarchical order 1 if possible the noise in question should be turned off and with the sources of noise off the ambient sound level shall be measured 2 if the noise source cannot be turned off then a fiveminute measurement of l90 shall be made and used as a trial correction for the ambient sound level if after this trial correction a violation of the limits is shown then the measurements are complete and nothing else need be done  else the methods set forth in this subsection b4 or subsection b3 of this section shall be used to determine the ambient sound level 3 if the sources of noise turn off some other time of day then with the sources of noise off the ambient sound level shall be measured within 24 hours of the noise measurement for example for daytime measurements at a plant or factory that operates only during daytime hours measurement of the ambient sound level might occur just before work begins during lunch or just after work ends for this method of determining the ambient 5 db shall be added to the measured ambient levels before they are used to adjust the measured noise sound levels that includes the ambient 4 if the sources of noise never turn off then the ambient sound level shall be measured at a like site at a like day of the week and at a like time of day for this method of determining the ambient 5 db shall be added to the measured ambient levels before they are used to adjust the measured noise sound levels that includes the ambient sound table iv correction in db that

k correction db note 2 3 2 1 0 1 this table provides a simple correction to measurements that are affected by ambient sound for example the sound of an industrial fan along with the ambient sound which is always present is measured as 65 dba and the ambient sound level alone without the fan is measured as 59 dba then  the difference in decibels is 6 db and the corresponding correction is 2 db that is 2 db are subtracted from the measured 65 dba level and it is adjusted to and reported as 63 dba 2 if the difference between the noise sound level plus ambient sound level and the ambient sound level alone is less than 3 db then it shall not constitute a violation of this article c constant noise constant noises possibly cycling such as the sound from fans blowers or compressors shall be measured if cyclic during the loudest cycle this measurement is of the noise sound level plus the ambient sound level the ambient sound level alone shall be determined using the method of subsection b of this section the maximum level which is the noise sound level plus ambient sound level shall be corrected to noise sound level alone using table iv in subsection b4b4 of this section 1 if it is not possible to demonstrate an exceedance of table i in section 10104b limits using the procedure set forth in subsection b4 of this section then one may proceed to use table ii in section 10104b using table ii shall involve the exact same steps as described for using table i but with the measurements being the octave band levels indicated in table ii in lieu of the aweighted measurements indicated in table i the measured octave band noise sound level plus ambient sound levels shall be corrected using the methods of table iv 2 the officer shall verify that the measured sound truly is the offending sound as he walks further from the offending sound source the levels must fall 3 if the offending noise is suspected of containing a prominent discrete tone enforcement officials may elect to measure a onethirdoctaveband spectrum this measurement if conducted will consist of the noise sound level plus the ambient level if this measurement is conducted then the ambient level alone shall be measured and the noise sound level plus the ambient sound level shall be corrected to noise sound level alone using the method in table iv the method of ansiasa s1291993 part 3 r2008 american

locations for wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support structures within the community and encourage the use of existing structures for attached wireless communication facility purposes consistent with the statement of purpose and intent set fo1ih in a purpose and intent above each licensed provider of a wireless communication facility must by law be permitted to locate sufficient facilities in order to achieve the objectives promulgated by the united states congress however particularly in light of the dramatic increase in the number of wireless communication facilities reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of the change of federal law and policy in and relating to the federal telecommunications act of 199 it is the policy of the township that all users should collocate on attached wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support structures in the interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this section as stated above and as stated in a purpose and intent if a provider fails or refuses to permit collocation on a facility owned or otherwise controlled by it where collocation is feasible the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be compelled in direct violation of and in direct contradiction to the basic policy intent and purpose of the township the provisions of this subsection are designed to carry out and encourage conformity with the policy of the township 2 feasibility of collocation collocation shall be deemed to be feasible for purposes of this section where all of the following are met a the wireless communication provider entity under consideration for collocation will undertake to pay market rent or other market compensation for collocation b the site on which collocation is being considered taking into consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a facility is able to provide structural support c the collocation being considered is technologically reasonable eg the collocation will not result in unreasonable interference given appropriate physical and other adjustment in relation to the structure antennas and the like d the height of the structure necessary for collocation will not be increased beyond a point deemed to be permissible by the township taking into consideration the several standards contained in subsections b and c above 3 requirements for collocation a the construction and use of a new wireless communication facility shall not be granted unless and until the applicant demonstrates that a feasible collocation is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs b all new and modified wireless communication facilities shall be designed and constructed so as to accommodate collocation iv  47 article iv c the policy of the community is for collocation thus if a party who owns or otherwise controls a facility shall fail or refuse to alter a structure so as to accommodate a proposed and otherwise feasible collocation such facility shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use and shall not be altered expanded or extended in any respect d if a party who owns or othe1wise controls a facility shall fail or refuse to permit a feasible collocation and this requires the construction andor use of a new facility the party failing or refusing to permit a feasible collocation shall be deemed to be in direct violation and contradiction of the policy intent and purpose of the township and consequently such party shall take responsibility for the violation and shall be prohibited from receiving approval for a new wireless communication support structure within the township for a period of five years from the date of the failure or refusal to permit the collocation such a party may seek and obtain a variance from the zoning board of appeals if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance relief which in this context shall mean a demonstration that enforcement of the five year prohibition would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent wireless communication services or that such enforcement would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless communication services f removal 1 a wireless communication facility must furnish reasonable evidence of ongoing operation at any time after construction 2 a condition of every approval of a wireless communication facility shall be removal of all or part of the facility by users and owners when the facility has
