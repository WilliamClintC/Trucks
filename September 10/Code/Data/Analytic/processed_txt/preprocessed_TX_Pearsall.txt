until such time as that documentation is provided water surface elevation means the height in relation to the national geodetic vertical datum ngvd of 1929 or other datum where specified of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas art ii statutory authorization the legislature of the state has in vtca water delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council does ordain the provisions of this chapter art i  a findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage art i  b statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area art i  c methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other

have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations art iii  d abrogation and greater restrictions this chapter is not intended to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions  however where this chapter and another ordinance easement covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail art iii  e interpretation in the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be 1 considered as minimum requirements  2 liberally construed in favor of the governing body  and 3 deemed neither to limit nor repeat any other powers granted under state statutes art iii  f warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations on rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes this chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
