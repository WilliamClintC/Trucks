location in relation to sensitive water resources within the town one of four categories will apply they are 1 zone ii protection areas to public drinking water supplies  2 contributing areas to fresh water lakes or ponds  3 contributing areas to coastal estuaries  and 4 those areas designated as not impacting in a significant way the sensitive water resources subdivisions with upland in excess of 80000 square feet per buildable lot would be designated as being in the fourth category no further analysis of development impact by subdivision in category four need to be performed unless specifically required by the planning board 31 zone ii protection areas to public drinking water supplies analysis should include the existing condition of the water supply including well location and construction and the quality of water pumped by the well a calculation of the total nitrogen loading from the proposed development in pounds per year and the predicted nitrogen concentration in ground water underneath the development in mg1 using loading rates provided in table g1 below a calculation of the predicted nitrogen concentration in ground water pumped by the water supply well from throughout the zone ii area this analysis must include a calculation of the total loading within the zone ii area from all sources under saturation or buildout conditions the loading analysis should use the loading rates provided in table g1 below a comparison of the results of the postdevelopment zone ii loading analysis to the critical nitrogen concentration of 5 mgl for water pumped by the water supply well if the predicted concentration is above 5 mgl the applicant must indicate nitrogen reduction measures for the proposed development that will reduce the nitrogen loading so the predicted concentration is 5 mgl or less 32 contributing areas to fresh water lakes or ponds analysis should include a map showing the boundaries of the contributing area based on ground water flow andor surface water runoff a calculation of the total phosphorus loading from the proposed developmnet in pounds per year using loading rates provided in table g2 below subdivision rules and regulations june 2016  a calculation of the predicted phosphorus concentration in the fresh water system from sources throughout the contributing area this analysis must include a calculation of the loading within the contributing area from all sources under saturation or buildout conditions the loading analysis should use the loading rates provided in table g2 below a comparison of the results of the postdevelopment phosphorus loading analysis to the critical phosphorus concentration of 02 mgl for the fresh water resource if the predicted concentration is above 02 mgl the applicant must indicate phosphorus reduction measures for the proposed development that will reduce the phosphorous loading so the predicted concentration is 02 mgl or less 33 contributing areas to coastal ponds or estuaries analysis should include a map showing the boundaries of the contributing area based on ground water flow a flushing calculation showing how quickly water and associated nutrients and other contaminants are removed from the coastal system into massachusetts bay a calculation of the total nitrogen loading from the proposed development in pounds per year using loading rates provided in table g1 below a calculation of the predicted nitrogen loading to ground water in pounds per year throughout the contributing areas this analysis must include a calculation of the total loading within the contributing area from all sources under saturation or buildout conditions the loading analysis should use the loading rates provided in table g1 below a comparison of the results of the predicted loading analysis for the postdevelopment condition to the critical nitrogen loading levels provided in table g3 below which are based on the flushing characteristics of the coastal system if the predicted concentration is above the critical loading levels the applicant must indicate nitrogen reduction measures for the proposed development that will reduce the nitrogen loading so the predicted
