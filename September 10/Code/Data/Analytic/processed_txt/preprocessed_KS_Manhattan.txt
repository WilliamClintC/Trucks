the all such ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto the source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end

reader can locate any section of the 1973 any subsequent ordinance included herein a table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the included at the back of this volume numbering system the numbering system used in this the same system used in many state and local government codes each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter thus the first section of chapter 1 is numbered 11 and the second section of chapter 6 is 62 under this system each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places simply by using the decimal system for amendments by way of illustration if new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 62 and 63 is desired to be added such new sections would be numbered 621 622 and 623 respectively new chapters may be included in the same manner if the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as chapter 125 care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters new articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or in the case of articles may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject and in the case of divisions may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject the next successive number being assigned to the article or division index the index has been prepared with the greatest of care each particular item has been placed under several headings some of the headings being couched in lay

the chief engineer of the division of water resources of the kansas department of agriculture on  2 kansas statutory authorization the legislature of the state of kansas has in ksa 12741 et seq and specifically in ksa 12766 delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare b findings of fact 1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of manhattan kansas are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 methods used to analyze flood hazards article x floodplain regulations x2 the fema and community special flood hazard areas are those identified in the effective flood insurance study fis for riley county and pottawatomie county dated  and its accompanying flood insurance rate maps firm and local or fema approved revisions to the firm andor fis which are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this areas where a preliminary firm and preliminary fis exist community base flood elevations shown on the preliminary firm and preliminary fis shall be used for local regulatory purposes if they are higher than those shown on the effective firm and fis the initial flood insurance rate maps are as follows for the jurisdictional areas at the initial date city of manhattan dated  riley county unincorporated areas dated  pottawatomie county unincorporated areas dated  the flood insurance study fis is the basis of this ordinance and uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this ordinance is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one 1% percent chance of occurrence in any one 1 year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto b calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood c computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height article x floodplain regulations x3 e delineation of floodway fringe  ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood c statement of purpose 1 it is the purpose of this promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize flood losses resulting from periodic inundation of the base flood by applying provisions designed to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities b require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction c protect individuals from buying or leasing lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard d minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding generally undertaken at the expense of the general public e assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the national flood insurance program 10102 general provisions a official floodplain map 1 the official floodplain map shall consist of the firm flood insurance

standards and 6 the spacing and layout of proposed streets curb cuts intersection locations medians and the number and location of ingress and egress points to the land covered by the plat are consistent with good traffic engineering design and public safety considerations and 7 the subdivider has made every reasonable effort to mitigate the impact of the proposed subdivision on the public health safety and general welfare including offsite impacts caused by increased traffic volume and altered traffic flow b in the event the muapb determines that there are physical characteristics of the parcel proposed to be platted which create circumstances that significantly and adversely impact the general health safety and welfare of the future users of the site or other areas and such circumstances are not adequately addressed by these regulations but reasonably would have been if they had been known or considered at the time of adoption of these regulations then the muapb may either impose conditions upon the plat approval or deny the plat whichever is reasonably necessary to address such circumstances c prior to the approval of a preliminary plat the muapb may require the
