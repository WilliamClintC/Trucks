reserved article ii post construction stormwater management division 1 generally findings the city finds that 1 the constitution and laws of the state authorize local units of government to provide stormwater management services and systems that will contribute to the protection and preservation of the public health safety and welfare and to the protection of our natural resources 2 water bodies roadways structures and other property within and downstream of city are at times subjected to flooding 3 land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds which may result in increased stormwater runoff rates volumes and duration increased flooding increased stream channel erosion and increased sediment transport and deposition 4 stormwater runoff produced as a consequence of land development contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants 5 increases of stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution have occurred as a result of land development and have impacted the water resources of the grand river watershed 6 increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes and the sediments and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects within the city will absent reasonable regulation and control adversely affect the city water bodies and water resources and those of downstream communities 7 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation of stormwater runoff from development 8 impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow 9 adopting the standards criteria and procedures contained in this ordinance and implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects of stormwater runoff 10 substantial economic losses can result from adverse impacts on the waters of the city and the watershed 11 improper design and construction of stormwater best management practices bmps can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation 12 the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities is necessary in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff 13 the regulation of land development by means of stormwater management policy and procedures and effective site planning will produce development that is compatible with the natural functions of the land or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of excessive stormwater runoff from development 1762 6102013 purpose a the purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing in the city and the watersheds to which it drains and to comply with the citys national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permit and other applicable federal and state regulations b this article seeks to meet that purpose by minimizing the negative impacts of increased stormwater discharges from new land development and redevelopment following objectives 1 to minimize increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes from identified land development

1 to provide a more desirable living environment by preserving the natural character of open fields stands of trees brooks hills and similar natural assets 2 to encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the development of residential areas 3 to encourage a more efficient aesthetic and desirable use of open area while recognizing a reduction in developing costs and by allowing the developer to bypass natural features on the site 4 to encourage the provision of open space within reasonable distance of all lot development of the subdivision and to further encourage the development of recreational facilities or preservation of natural environmental assets b modifications of the standards as outlined in article xvi of this chapter may be made in the rld districts when the following conditions are met 1 lot dimensions may be reduced provided that the number of residential lots shall be no greater than if the land area to be subdivided was developed in the minimum

application for approval of the subdivision open space plat shall be submitted at the time of submission of the preliminary plat for approval as required by chapter 36 of this  onefamily clustering option a intent 1 the intent of this section is to permit the development of onefamily residential patterns which innovations will provide for an alternative means for development of singlefamily areas where a parcel of land has characteristics which hinder practical development under the normal subdivision approach or where the alternative will permit better preservation of natural features also this option may permit increased densities under certain circumstances to accomplish this modifications to the onefamily residential standards as outlined in article xvi of this chapter may be permitted in the rld districts 2 in the rld districts the requirements of article xvi of this chapter may be waived and the attaching of onefamily dwelling units may be permitted subject to the standards of this section b conditions for qualification 1 qualification for the cluster option shall be based on two findings by the planning commission with final density dependent upon whether or not the site qualifies under both findings a first the planning commission shall find that the parcel will qualify for the cluster development option as defined in subsection b2a of this section development would be at the singlefamily densities as permitted in subsection c1 of this section this finding must be made in all cases b second the planning commission may additionally find that the parcel is located in a transition area or is impacted by nonresidential uses or traffic on major or secondary thoroughfares or other similar conditions if the planning commission makes such a finding it may permit an increase in density up to the maximum densities established in subsection c2 of this section 2 the planning commission may approve the clustering or attaching of buildings on parcels of land under single ownership and control which in the opinion of the planning commission have characteristics that would make sound physical development under the normal subdivision approach impractical because of parcel size shape or dimension or because the site is located in a transitional use area or the site has natural characteristics which are worth preserving or which make platting difficult in approving a parcel for cluster development the planning commission shall find at least one of the following conditions to exist a the parcel to be developed has frontage on a major or secondary thoroughfare and is generally parallel to said thoroughfare and is of shallow depth as measured from the thoroughfare b the parcel has frontage on a major or secondary thoroughfare and is of a narrow width as measured along the thoroughfare which makes platting difficult c a substantial portion of the parcels perimeter is bordered by a major thoroughfare which would result in a substantial proportion of the lots of the development abutting the major thoroughfare d a substantial portion of the parcels perimeter is bordered by land that is zoned other than singlefamily residential or is developed for a use other than onefamily homes e the parcel is shaped in such a way that the angles formed by its boundaries make a subdivision difficult to achieve and the parcel has frontage on a major or secondary thoroughfare f the parcel contains a floodplain or soil conditions which result in a substantial portion of the total area of the parcel being unbuildable g the parcel contains natural assets which would be preserved use of cluster development such assets may include natural stands of large trees land which serves as a natural habitat for wildlife unusual topographic features or other natural assets which should be preserved 3 in order to qualify a parcel for development under subsection b1f and g of this section the planning commission shall determine that the parcel has those characteristics and the request shall be supported by written or graphic documentation prepared by a landscape architect engineer professional community planner registered architect or environmental design professional such documentation shall include the following as appropriate soil test borings floodplain map topographic map of maximum twofoot contour interval inventory of natural assets 4 this option shall not apply to those parcels of land which have been split for the specific purpose of coming within the requirements of this cluster option section c permitted densities in a cluster development the maximum density permitted shall be as follows including streets and road rightsofway 1 for those parcels qualifying under subsection a1e of this section the density permitted is 2 units per acre 2 for those parcels qualifying under subsection a1a of this section an increase in density may be permitted by the planning commission up to 37 units per acre 3 water areas within the parcel may be included in the computation of density provided that land adjacent to the water is substantially developed as open space 4 in those instances where increased densities may be permitted under subsection c2 of this section the planning commission must find that such increased density does not result in the destruction or total removal of the
