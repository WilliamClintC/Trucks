the extent caused by operational error improperly designed or inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventative maintenance or careless or improper operations 2 an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards but the user must demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that a an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  b the facility was at the time of the upset operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  c the user has submitted the following information to the superintendent within twentyfour 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset oral communications must be followed with written submissions within five 5 days 1 a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance 2 the period of noncompliance including the exact times and dates or if not corrected the anticipated time noncompliance is expected to continue and 3 steps being taken andor planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance 3 in any enforcement proceedings the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof 4 users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards 5 the user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with

situations where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails b bypass 1 for the purposes of this section bypass is defined as the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a users treatment facility severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production 2 if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the potw at least ten 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible a user shall

aware of the bypass written notices shall contain a description of the bypass and its causes the duration of the bypass including exact dates times and if not corrected the anticipated time the bypass is expected to continue and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrences of the bypass the superintendent may waive the written requirements if the oral notice was received within twentyfour 24 hours on a casebycase basis 3 bypass is prohibited and the superintendent may take enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there was no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of an auxiliary treatment facility retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  c the user submitted notices as required under subsection 1047b2 of this section  d the superintendent may approve

businesses  state of minnesota the council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this article as adult theaters and adult cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 at least fifty 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids acquired immunodeficiency syndrome caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states six hundred 600 in 1982  two thousand two hundred 2200 in 1983  four thousand six hundred 4600 in 1984  eight thousand five hundred fiftyfive 8555 in 1985  and two hundred fiftythree thousand four

with over onehalf million 500000 cases being reported in 1990 12 in his report of  the surgeon general of the united states has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 16 the findings noted in subsections 1 15 raise substantial governmental concerns 17 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22 in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct 23 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article 24 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serve as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 25 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article  11403
