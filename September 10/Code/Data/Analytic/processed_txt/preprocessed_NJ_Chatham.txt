environmental commission  see ch 11 land development regulations  see ch 165 storm sewer system  see ch 237  1301 purpose a chapter to regulate the outdoor application of fertilizer so as to reduce the overall amount of excess nutrients entering waterways thereby helping to protect and improve surface water quality  1302 basis and background elevated levels of nutrients particularly phosphorus in surface water bodies can result in excessive and accelerated growth of algae and aquatic plants eutrophication excessive plant growth can result in diurnal variations and extremes in dissolved oxygen and ph which in turn can be detrimental to aquatic life as algae and plant materials die off the decay process creates a further demand on dissolved oxygen levels the presence of excessive plant matter can also restrict use of the affected water for recreation and water supply while healthy vegetated areas are protective of water quality by stabilizing soil and filtering precipitation when fertilizers are applied to the land surface improperly or in excess of the needs of target vegetation nutrients can be transported by means of stormwater to nearby waterways contributing to the problematic growth of excessive aquatic vegetation most soils in new jersey contain sufficient amounts of phosphorus to support adequate root growth for established turf over time it is necessary to replenish available phosphorus but generally not at the levels commonly applied other target vegetation such as vegetable gardens and agriculturalhorticultural plantings will have a greater need for phosphorus application as will the repair or establishment of new lawns or cover vegetation a soils test and fertilizer application recommendation geared to the soil and planting type is the best means to determine the amount of nutrients to apply timing and placement of fertilizer application is also critical to avoid transport of nutrients to waterways runoff fertilizer applied immediately prior to a runoffproducing rainfall outside the growing season or to impervious surfaces is most likely to be carried away by means of runoff without accomplishing the desired objective of supporting target vegetation growth therefore the management of the type amount and techniques for fertilizer application is necessary as one tool to protect water resources  12920 drugfree zones  1303   1303
