1 repealed the former art ix  2226022281 and enacted a new art ix as set out herein the former art ix pertained to massage establishments and derived from  findings  public purpose the mayor and city council find that the general assembly has adopted ocga  4324a1 et seq the georgia massage therapy practice act which imposes licensing requirements on massage therapists the georgia massage therapy practice act and this article seek to clearly differentiate between the therapeutic and beneficial services of massage therapists licensed by the georgia board of massage therapy and other types of bodywork and massage businesses that are in most instances operated by persons who are not licensed by the georgia board of massage therapy in fact the georgia massage therapy practice act does not impose any requirements upon those persons or establishments in the business of providing bodywork therapy the mayor and city council find that it is in the best interests of the health welfare safety and morals of the community to provide for the regulation of bodywork therapists and bodywork therapy establishments based upon research and the experience of other communities and municipalities the mayor and city council find that certain bodywork therapy establishments beget and degenerate into undesirable community conditions including but not limited to depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood increased expenditures for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order increased burden on the judicial system and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas accordingly it is in the best interests of the health welfare safety and morals of the community to enact regulations to reduce the adverse impacts of bodywork therapy establishments however the mayor and city council also find that the outright prohibition of such establishments could improperly infringe upon certain constitutional rights of those wishing to operate licensed establishments the mayor and city council find that qualified bodywork therapists have received extensive training to provide bodywork therapy that has been proven to be therapeutic  however regulations are necessary to protect the public from unqualified practitioners the mayor and city council find that it is in the best interests of the public to set guidelines and procedures for those who seek to practice bodywork therapy  to promote high standards of professional performance for those practicing bodywork therapy  and to protect the public from unprofessional conduct by persons licensed to practice bodywork therapy this article seeks to clearly differentiate between the therapeutic and beneficial services of bodywork therapists and other types of bodywork and massage businesses that are in most instances operated by persons who have little or no formal training in bodywork therapy and are commercial operations for illegal sexually oriented services the mayor and city council find that state licensed massage therapists have received extensive training to provide massage therapy that has been proven to be therapeutic  however regulations are necessary to protect the public from unqualified practitioners therefore the purpose of this article is to differentiate from massage therapy and reasonably regulate bodywork therapy and bodywork therapy establishments in a manner that serves the legitimate governmental interests of reducing criminal activity protecting property values and providing for safe and sanitary conditions without unreasonably infringing upon the protected rights of licensed bodywork therapy establishments and their patrons 1  1 definitions the following definitions are to clarify terms found

opioids has risen dramatically due in large part to the increase in the use of these analgesics to manage pain 1  opioids are prescribed to alleviate pain ranging from moderate to severe as described by the patient these analgesics principally affect the nervous system suppressing the signals of pain sent to the brain  examples of these medications can include but not be limited to morphine codeine oxycodone eg oxycontin percodan percocet and related drugs as opioids block the perception of pain they also have the effect of creating a state of euphoria which may be heightened when abused side effects can include drowsiness nausea constipation and respiratory constraint opioids are recognized as very effective when taken as prescribed for legitimate purposes post surgery for example as the national institute on drug abuse states many studies have shown that the properly managed shortterm medical use of opioid analgesic drugs is safe and rarely causes addiction  defined as the compulsive and uncontrollable use of drugs despite adverse consequences  or dependence which occurs when the body adapts to the presence of a drug and often results in withdrawal symptoms when that drug is reduced or stopped 4  unfortunately opioids taken longterm can create physical dependency in some patients producing withdrawal symptoms when the medication is not taken cessation side effects can include bone pain insomnia and vomiting to name a few since the tragic events of  the rise in the diversion of legal prescription drugs has grown exponentially due to increased security at the borders and ports 6 amplified security has effectively reduced the supply of illegal drugs traditionally smuggled by the drug trade necessitating the need to find alternative methods of supplying drugs to users  consequently legal prescription drugs are now being diverted to illegal uses  diversion these diverted drugs are schedule ii iii and iv drugs which principally include opioids as well as complementary drugs like soma carisoprodol a muscle relaxant and xanax alprazolam an antianxiety medication 7  in recent years south florida including miamidade broward and palm counties have witnessed tremendous growth in the number of pain clinics that have opened in addition to the rapid increase of the diversion of prescription drugs broward county has been termed the painkiller capital of the unites states and the columbia for pharmaceutically diverted drugs 8 broward county had four pain clinics in 200 jumping to 115 by november 200 of a total of 176 such clinics in all of south florida 9 the majority of these pain clinics are nothing more than pill mills diverting these scheduled drugs to illegal uses as clinics have multiplied the deaths due to overdoses of prescription drug medications specifically opioids have skyrocketed 10  with broward county on the forefront of this epidemic a grand jury was empanelled to investigate issuing a report on  after hearing testimony from prescription drug abusers and their families federal and state law enforcement officials physicians prosecutors and many more stakeholders the report provides valuable information regarding the current state of this epidemic as well as recommendations to curtail this rapidly growing public safety concern as broward county and other south florida jurisdictions struggle to eliminate pill mills this outbreak of illicit pain clinics crossed into other states notably georgia and texas 11 in fact the cobb county prescription drug task force reports that in 200 8246 percent overdose deaths statewide involved pharmaceuticals going to 8511 percent in 2008 alprazolam hydrocodone and oxycodone were found to constitute the top five substances involved in all of these overdose deaths 12 soma and xanax are often combined with opioids as a cocktail distributed together at illegal pain clinics 13 illegal pain clinics commonly known as pill mills dispense large quantities of schedule ii iii and iv drugs for cash with little examination of the patient conducted scheduled drugs are dispensed at these establishments or prescriptions are written to be filled at a legitimate pharmacy often out of jurisdiction and outofstate license plates are in the parking lots of these clinics with individuals driving great distances to receive these prescriptions pill mills often hire security guards to handle unruly patients and perhaps even scout for law enforcement individuals seeking these services will often fake an ailment forging an mri or providing falsified medical documentation to receive prescriptions in turn the physicians conduct lackadaisical examinations of these individuals simply asking them what they want with regard to medication 14 while studies and research illustrate that pill mills more often than not pose as pain clinics this perception can be inaccurate many legitimate pain clinics operate daily throughout the state and nation faithfully treating their patients with the highest ethical standards pill mills are capable of posing as urgent care clinics family medical practices and neighborhood pharmacies for example in fact any medical store front could operate as a pill mill the reality however is that the vast majority of medical establishments and pharmacies are absolutely legitimate the city of holly springs city council adopted a 12month moratorium on the issuance of business licenses to pain management clinics on  to conduct the proper research and vetting to create a new ordinance and municipal code addressing pill mills after thorough research the city council has prepared this article to ensure that anyone dispensing or prescribing drugs within the city limits of holly springs is doing so in compliance with state law preliminary information will be gathered from proposed medical establishments and pharmacies to properly route the business applicable regulatory and zoning reviews prior to the issuance of a business license occupation tax permit 2  1 footnotes    khary k rigg samantha j march and james a inciardi prescription drug abuse & diversion role of the pain clinic journal of

regulations they may be considered for residential subdivisions to combat unsafe speeding and nonresident cutwhen warranted caution must be exercised to carefully evaluate the reported traffic problems to ensure satisfaction of the minimum warrants and to ensure implementation of the correct traffic calming scenario based on experience implementation of physical changes such as street closing speed humps and tables often result in relocation of traffic problems to other parallel roadways traffic calming solutions with physical restrictions are only considered for subdivision or local streets they will not be considered for roadways with a collector or higher classification without major review of the impact on the transportation system on local and regional level   1  traffic calming solutions it is recognized that an array of traffic calming solutions exists an incremental approach that involves identification of the most effectiveleast costly solution is necessary to select the appropriate measures the solution array may include but not limited to the following a neighborhood education  b consistent enforcement  c additional signage  d speed trailers  e permanent speed displays  f turn restrictions  g median chokers  h speed tables and humps  i street narrowing  j traffic circles  k street closures   1  speed humps and speed tables a speed humps

the federal clean water act as amended by the water quality act of 1987 33 usc 1251 et seq and rules promulgated by the united states environmental protection agency pursuant to the act emphasize the role of local governments in developing implementing conducting and funding stormwater management programs which address water quality impacts of storm water runoff 2 stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities will assist the city in meeting the regulatory obligations imposed by its national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit by reducing pollution and increasing water quality within the city 3 stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities will assist the city in protecting the public health safety and welfare and the environment providing stormwater management services systems and facilities renders both service and benefit to individual parcels parcel owners citizens and residents of the city 4 the area of impervious surface on each parcel is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future and the area of impervious surfaces on each parcel is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a stormwater service charge 5 a system for the collection conveyance storage treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas 6 stormwater runoff is associated with all developed properties whether residential or nonresidential and the impacts of runoff from individual properties are directly related to the amount of impervious surface on a property 7 a dedicated funding mechanism in the city dedicated specifically for generating consistent stable and adequate revenue to fund stormwater management services will ensure that the city of holly springs has resources available to address stormwater issues as they arise 8 stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city limits of the city of holly springs while specific service and facility demands vary from location to location a service area that encompasses all lands and water bodies within the geographic limits of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community 9 the city is responsible for the protection and preservation of the public health safety and welfare of the community as well as the environment and finds that it is in the best interest of the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city and the community at large and the environment to proceed with the development implementation and operation of a utility for stormwater management accounted for in the city budget as a separate enterprise fund dedicated solely to stormwater management and to institute funding methods associated therewith 10 considering these findings the city council finds that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities and the city council finds that a stormwater service fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding stormwater management services in the city 1 definitions the following definitions shall apply to this article all other words or phrases shall be given their common ordinary meaning unless the context clearly requires otherwise credit means a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational onsite stormwater system or facility or the provision of a service or activity by property owner which system facility service or activity reduces the stormwater utilitys cost of providing stormwater services and facilities the basis of such credits if granted will be defined by a specific written agreement at the determination of the stormwater utility manager in accordance with the stormwater utility credit policy customer means all persons or entities to whom the stormwater service charge is billed detached dwelling unit means developed land containing one structure which is not attached to another dwelling and which contains one or more bedrooms with a bathroom and kitchen facilities designed for occupancy by one family detached dwelling units may include houses manufactured homes and mobile homes located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land developed land may be classified as a detached dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages carports or small storage buildings or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas such as parking spaces playgrounds or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices storage facilities meeting rooms classrooms houses of worship or similar nonresidential uses detached dwelling unit shall not include developed land containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by other than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes or multiple dwelling unit residential properties developed land means real property which has been altered from its natural state by addition of any improvements such as grading paving compaction construction of structures or impervious surfaces greater than 200 square feet or drainage works so that hydrologic response of the property is changed from that which would occur in the natural undeveloped conditions for new construction property shall be considered developed pursuant to this article upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy or upon completion of construction or final inspection if no such certificate is issued equivalent residential unit eru means the statistical average impervious surface area of a detached singlefamily residential property within the city an eru will be determined analysis and will be adopted by city council with resolution from time to time this unit may be used in the rate study evaluation to determine and compute the service charge for all developed land served by the holly springs stormwater utility an alternative unit of measure for impervious surface may be used for the rate structure the methodology and basis for the stormwater service charge will be adopted by city council with resolution from time to time hydrologic response of a property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects remains infiltrates and is conveyed from a property it is dependent on several factors including but not limited to the presence of impervious area  the size shape topographic vegetative and geologic conditions of a property  antecedent moisture conditions  and groundwater conditions on a property impervious surfaces mean those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development the following types of surfaces will be considered impervious surfaces for purposes of the stormwater utility the projected area of buildings  asphalt concrete brick or stonepaved areas  improved vehicular drives and parking areas  gravel surfaces  compacted soil surfaces  fabric or plastic coverings  and other surfaces that prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff or that change the hydrologic response of the property that existed prior to development parcel means a designated parcel tract or area of land established by plat subdivision or as otherwise permitted by law to be separately owned used developed or built upon private stormwater management system means those natural and manmade channels swales ditches rivers streams creeks branches reservoirs ponds drainageways inlets catch basins pipes headwalls storm drains lakes and other physical works

additions to existing development require only a sketch showing changes to be submitted to the director for review and approval 240 187 minimum tree density requirement a all sites within the city other than forsale residential lots shall maintain a minimum tree density of twenty 20 units per acre all sites within the city other than forsale residential lots shall maintain a minimum tree density of 20 units per acre the term unit is an expression of basal area as defined herein and is not synonymous with tree the density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development the density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved planting new trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this or some combination of the two minimum tree density shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in appendix b to this developer shall be subject to the minimum tree density requirement set forth in this paragraph but the developer shall base its density calculations on the net site area excluding the acreage required for buffers and infrastructure improvements roads utility lines detention ponds etc in no event shall a parking lot be considered an infrastructure improvement b all newly constructed forsale residential lots in the city shall maintain a minimum tree density based upon the maximum number of trees that can be maintained within thirty percent 30% of the lots plantable area taking into consideration the standards established in this tree size and separation the density requirement must be met whether or not the individual lot had trees prior to development the density requirement is calculated by determining lot size and deducting the impervious area assigning the necessary root zone for trees 400 sq feet  for overstory trees and 200 sq feet  for understory trees all forsale residential lots constructed prior to the effective date of this required to maintain the requirements of this a twenty percent 20% level rather than the thirty percent 30% requirement used for new construction c the density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved planting new trees according to the minimum standards of this or some combination of the two in addition replanting on such lots shall be at a ratio of not less than one 1 overstory tree minimum twoinch 2 caliper for every three 3 understory trees minimum oneinch 1 caliper no more than thirty percent 30% of any one genus may be included in any replanting plan d notwithstanding the foregoing

area location water retention location and the like developers shall receive a density credit of two 2 times the assigned unit value for each specimen tree saved by utilizing an alternate design specimen trees that cannot be saved must be replaced with trees having a total density equal three 3 times the unit value of the tree removed with a minimum fourinch 4 tree caliper specimen trees removed without prior approval shall be replaced with trees equal to eight 8 times the unit value with a minimum fourinch 4 tree caliper and subject to the applicable penalties as described in e the intent of these regulations is to ensure that a minimum density of trees is maintained on all developed sites occasionally this intent cannot be met because a project site will not bear the required density of trees to provide some alternatives in such cases two alternative methods of compliance may at the discretion of the director be approved 241 planting at a location remote from the project site  or contributing to the city of holly springs tree replacement fund 1 the following standards have been established for administering these alternative compliance methods the director must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance in no instance shall 100% of the required site density be met compliance as many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site in question 2 no permit shall be issued until the director has approved the request and received the necessary documentation andor funds if trees are to be planted at another location the offsite location should be in the same area of the city as the project site and a tree replacement plan meeting all applicable standards must be reviewed and approved by the city manager or his designee 3 where the proposed development area is so dense that the minimum site density factor cannot reasonably be achieved the development area shall be reduced by removing parking spaces in excess of the minimum number of spaces required by zoning placing additional planting islands within the development area or reducing the area to be occupied by buildings where these methods are not feasible or are ineffective the developer may make application to participate in the tree replacement fund a minimum of fifty percent 50% of the required density must be met on the development site in order to make application the developer may contribute towards the tree replacement fund in an amount not to exceed fifty percent 50% of the required density based on the caliper size of trees pursuant to the city of holly springs municipal services master fee schedule 4 one hundred percent 100% of the required density must be met providing the density on the development site or combination of providing the required density on the development site and participating in the tree replacement fund funds contributed to the tree replacement fund may be used by the city to purchase and install trees in the citys public areas to include parks green spaces rightsofway and government building sites 188 tree survey plan and inventory a a tree survey shall be provided in the form of a toscale map or a site

replacement that all applicable sites maintain a minimum tree density of 20 units per acre the term unit is an expression of the basal area a standard forest inventory measurement and is not synonymous with tree this density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development the density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved planting new trees or some combination of the two as represented by the formula sdf  edf   rdf where sdf site density factorthe minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site units per acre edf existing density factordensity of existing trees to be preserved on a site rdf replacement density factordensity of new trees to be planted on a site the sdf is calculated by multiplying the number of acres by the tree density requirement  example a 22 acre site has a sdf of 22  20   44 the edf is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees to density factor units table b1 below show this calculation example a total of 15 trees will remain on the 22 acre site the tree inventory is as follows 712 inch diameter pines 121 inch diameter hickory 314 inch diameter pines 130 inch

following criteria are used by the director to identify specimen trees a specimen tree is any tree which qualifies for special consideration for preservation due to its size type condition location or historical significance and is determined by the city arborist prior to development to be in overall good health without the aid of a specialized care plan according to accepted isa practices and which also meets the minimum size criteria set forth below size criteria pine trees 30inch 30 diameter or larger overstory trees 24inch 24 diameter or larger understory trees 8inch 8 diameter or larger in order to encourage the conservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects additional density credit will be given for specimen trees which are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose credit for any specimen tree thus saved would be two 2 times the assigned unit value shown in table b3 the critical root zone of specimen trees will be protected with hogbackwireback tree save fencing with metal support poles or as described in section 1811 if a specimen tree is to be removed a plan or written document indicating the reason for the removal must be submitted to the director specimen trees that cannot be saved see  must be replaced with trees having two 2 times the unit value of the tree removed with a minimum fourinch 4 tree caliper by species with potentials for comparable size and quality any specimen tree which is removed without the appropriate review and approval of the director must be replaced by trees with a total density equal to eight 8 times the unit value of the tree removed with a minimum fourinch 4 tree caliper size alone will determine whether a tree was a specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is no evidence of its condition violations will be subject to the applicable penalties as described in specimen trees removed on forsale residential
