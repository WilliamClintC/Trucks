and aquatic systems where the water table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow water for purposes of this definition wetlands must have three 3 of the following attributes a a predominance of hydric soils  b inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions  c under normal circumstances support a prevalence of such vegetation wetland buffer strip an area of vegetated ground cover abutting a wetland that either in its natural condition or has the characteristics identified in of this amended by 2611 wetlands exceptional quality exceptional quality wetlands contain an abundance of different plant species with dominance evenly spread among several species such wetlands may support some rare or unusual plant species invasive or exotic plant species are either absent or limited to small areas where some disturbance has occurred this higher level of plant species diversity generally provides high wildlife habitat value and may also support rare wildlife species the shorelines of exceptional quality wetlands are natural and unaffected by erosion these wetlands exhibit no evidence of significant man induced water level fluctuation exceptional quality wetlands provide excellent water quality protection high aesthetic quality and provide excellent opportunities for educational and scientific activities within the community wetlands high quality high quality wetlands are still generally in their natural state and tend to show less evidence of adverse effects of surrounding land uses exotic and invasive plant species may be present and species dominance may not be evenly distributed among several species however a minimum of twenty 20 different species can be found within the basin there tends to be little evidence of water level fluctuation due to storms and their shorelines are stable with little evidence of erosion the combination of these factors result in these wetlands being judged as providing a greater level of water quality protection and significantly better wildlife habitat they show little if any evidence of human influences and their greater levels of species diversity wildlife habitat and ecological stability results in higher aesthetic quality these characteristics also offer opportunities for educational or scientific value to the community wetlands low quality wetlands included in this category have been substantially altered by agricultural or urban development that caused over nutrification soil erosion sedimentation and water quality degradation as a result of these factors these wetlands exhibit low levels of plant species and a related reduction in the quality of wildlife habitat these wetlands may also tend to exhibit extreme water level fluctuations in response to storms and show evidence of shoreline erosion while these wetlands do provide for water quality and serve an important role in protecting water quality downstream the combination of these characteristics cause these wetlands to provide low levels of water quality protection and to have poor aesthetic quality they often exhibit evidence of significant human influences and they are deemed to be of little educational or scientific value to the community wetlands medium quality medium quality wetlands have a slightly higher number of plant species present than low quality wetlands often with small pockets of indigenous species within larger areas dominated by invasive or exotic species their relatively greater species diversity results in slightly better wildlife habitat they exhibit evidence of relatively less fluctuation in water level in response to storms and less evidence of shoreline erosion as a result of these characteristics these wetlands provide somewhat better water quality protection they also exhibit relatively less evidence of human influences and therefore tend to be of a higher aesthetic quality these wetlands are still judged to be of limited educational or scientific value to the community wetland

incorporation by reference subd 1 the city has determined that wetlands serve to maintain water quality by filtering water that is discharged into ground water aquifers and by retaining inorganic sediments toxicants and nutrients they also retain and reduce the discharge of phosphorus and transform nutrients from their inorganic to organic forms thereby protecting streams and water bodies from eutrophication and contamination wetlands also store runoff and reduce the velocity of and magnitude of flood peaks in addition some wetlands receive the upward discharge of ground water these wetlands tend to support more stable biological communities since their water temperatures and water levels tend to be more stable subd 2 wetland vegetation also reduces the energy of waves currents and other erosive forces and serves to prevent the erosion of shoreline areas in addition aquatic vegetation provides food shelter and special habitat for wildlife all of these wetland characteristics provide valuable recreation and education resources subd 3 the city has also found that wetlands vary significantly in the degree that they have been altered wetlands within the city exhibit great variations in their floral diversity quality of wildlife and fishery habitat degree of fluctuation in response to storms the extent to which their shorelines have been altered or eroded and their relative value in protecting water quality therefore the city has determined that it is necessary and beneficial to classify wetlands based upon their functions and values the city has also found that it is in the best interest of the general health and welfare of the city to achieve no net loss of wetlands within the community subd 4 the city recognizes that a substantial amount of wetland degradation results from sedimentation and nutrient loading related to construction projects therefore the city finds it necessary to require extraordinary measures to prevent such constructionrelated degradation subd 5 in addition to having regulations that affect the physical impacts within wetland areas the city also finds that it is necessary to regulate the use of lands surrounding wetlands wetland buffer strips as defined by  are necessary and beneficial to maintaining the health of wetlands these strips of land surrounding wetlands protect their shorelines from erosion while serving to filter sediment chemicals and other nutrients before storm water discharges into the wetland wetland buffer strips are also beneficial in providing habitat for wildlife subd 6 this incorporates by reference the wetlands conservation act of 1991 minn stat 103g221 et seq herein after referred to as the wca and any future amendments adopted by the legislature any activities exempted from the provisions of the wca are also exempted from the requirements of this insofar as they relate to the wca all wetlands as defined in of this including those governed by the department of natural resources are covered by the provisions of this there are circumstances under which the strict enforcement of these regulations may be unreasonable and in circumstances that meet the criteria established in subsection 2167010 of this departures from the strict application of these standards may be permitted subd 7 it is the intent of this avoid the alteration and destruction of wetlands when wetlands are altered or destroyed mitigation must be provided to recreate the functions and values of the lost wetland in accordance with the wetland replacement plan requirements outlined in subsection 2167011 of this amended by 2211 amended by 2611 2167002 purpose and implementation subd 1 through the adoption and enforcement of this the city shall promote the general health safety and welfare of its residents by both conserving and protecting wetlands and requiring sound management practices and mitigation as provided for in the wca when development occurs in the vicinity of wetlands through the implementation of this the city seeks to accomplish the following purposes a to satisfy the requirements of the wca as it may be amended and thereby achieve no net loss of wetlands within the city  b to balance the needs to preserve and protect natural resources and systems with both the rights of private property owners and the need to support the efficient use of developable land within the city  c to preserve the natural character of the landscape maintenance of wetland ecosystems  d to promote water quality by maintaining the ability of wetlands to recharge ground water and receive the discharge of ground water to retain sediment and toxicants and filter and strip nutrients from surface water runoff before it discharges into community lakes and streams thus avoiding the contamination and eutrophication of these water features  and e to provide wildlife habitat and thereby support the maintenance of diversity of both plant and animal species within the city subd 2 to accomplish these purposes the city will a maintain an inventory of all wetlands within the city  b maintain a system of classification for wetlands within the city and classify the citys wetlands based upon their relative values related to floral diversity wildlife habitat water quality protection fishery habitat flood storage shoreline protection and aesthetic recreational and education benefits c prepare and maintain a comprehensive set of official maps identifying the location and classification of all wetlands within the city d establish wetland regulations that are coordinated with flood plain and shoreland protection regulations e require sound management practices to protect conserve maintain enhance and improve the quality of wetlands within the community f enforce standards for the alteration of wetlands when alteration is allowed including standards and procedures for the mitigation of the loss of wetland areas and their functions and values when alteration or destruction occurs g obtain protective easements over or acquire fee title to wetlands as appropriate h develop and maintain a program to educate the public about the numerous benefits and features that wetlands provide and the adverse effects of improperly managed urban development on wetlands amended by 2310 2167003 general provisions subd 1 identification and delineation of
