district 1 calculating residential yield of a proposed conservation subdivision  the number of dwelling units that may be developed on a given site shall be determined using the following approach a subtract the cumulative area in square feet of the following site elements from the total square foot area of the site 1 wetlands and watercourses  2 floodplains as shown on the latest fema mapping as

residential density grd permitted fractional numbers shall be rounded down to the whole number example 435000 square feet parcel subtract 30000 square feet of conservation features in accordance with a subtract 41000 square feet of infrastructure leaving 364000 square feet eligible for development divide by 80000 density factor result   3 dwelling units maximum 2 residential design layout  see

considered contiguous if it is separated by a road or other unobstructed way the open space in conservation subdivisions shall be adjacent to and accessible to all of the the subdivision noncontiguous

parking sites traffic circulation patterns loading areas storm drainage facilities and traffic access and egress including driveways the development of parking areas for nonresidential uses is in the ru is treated differently from other zones in the town as protection of the environment is factored into the parking expectation of rural areas in a different manner than more developed areas as rural character is dependent on the enhancement and preservation of natural features smaller parking areas with differing surfaces will be encouraged in those areas natural substitutes to stormwater management are also a critical component of rural parking areas parking areas in the other zones must consider the built environment and would focus on function more than in the ru parking areas in the su should be limited and designed to reflect a neighborhood character parking in the town centerwestchester village and future development areas would be larger but would require more design

designated as required by cgs ah 104 reduced and shared parking it is the intent of these regulations that all structures and land uses be provided with a sufficient amount of offstreet motor vehicle parking while allowing for some flexibility of site design to accommodate the unique characteristics of individual properties this the regulations is intended to set standards for conditions under which shared parking may be allowed the commission may require the submission of a parking demand analysis as part of any request for parking approval effective date  93 1 except for buildings used or occupied for residential use all or part of the offstreet parking requirement may be satisfied by shared parking arrangements or public transportation where the proposed planning design and construction includes the following a sufficient publicly owned or shared parking spaces within five hundred 500 feet of the proposed development site b access to a regularly scheduled transit stop

applicant believes that the required parking amounts are in excess of what is needed for the proposed use the applicant may submit a request with justification to the commission to support reduced parking space requirements the commission will consider and act on this request concurrent with and as part of the application process reduced parking approval requires a seventyfive percent 75% affirmative vote of the membership requests for parking below the minimum required must include detailed study or data which indicate how parking will be provided and why the request should be granted 3 parking space held on reserve for phased developments the commission may provide that up to fifty percent 50% of the parking spaces required by this not be immediately constructed and kept in reserve such reserve parking areas must be kept planted and maintained rather than surfaced for parking until such time as the additional parking space is necessary to serve completed phases of the associated development no above ground improvements shall be placed or constructed upon such reserve parking areas the areas designated as reserve parking must be clearly depicted on the phased development site plan and the terms and conditions of phasing of the parking area completion as determined by the commission must clearly be set forth in notations on the approved site plan stormwater management systems must either be sized to accommodate the full parking area at build out or developed along with the phased construction of parking areas the commission may require a bond or other mechanism to ensure that the reserve areas are developed if necessary 4 shared parking  at an applicants request shared parking may be provided in any district subject to the following provisions a a reciprocal written agreement has been executed by all the parties concerned that assures the perpetual joint use of such common parking a copy of which has been submitted to and is acceptable to the commission the commission may forward such agreements to the town legal counsel for review b the commission may require the applicant to provide a parking study with all information deemed necessary to its decisionmaking on a shared parking agreement this information might include but is not limited to a the type and hours of operation and parking demand for each use b a site plan displaying shared use spaces in the effective date  94 lot and walking distance to the uses sharing the lot c a description of the character of land use and parking patterns of adjacent land uses and d an estimate of anticipated turnover in parking space use over the course of twelve 12 to twentyfour 24 hours at the site parking spaces to be shared must not be reserved for individuals or groups on a twentyfour 24 hour basis c uses sharing a shared parking facility do not need to be contained on the same lot but shall be a maximum of five hundred 500 feet from the parking space in the parking lot which is to be used and allow for safe convenient walking for parkers including safe pedestrian crossings signage and adequate lighting 1 if the conditions for shared parking become null and void andor the shared parking arrangement is discontinued this will constitute a violation of these regulations for any use approved expressly with shared parking the applicant must then provide written notification of the change to the zoning enforcement officer and within sixty 60 days of that notice provide a remedy satisfactory to the commission to provide adequate parking d reduction in required parking space for shared parking  where shared parking is provided for a mixed use of land the commission may allow the following at the applicants request 1 up to thirty percent 30% of the parking spaces required for the predominant use on a site may be shared with other uses operating during the same time of day and days of the week the predominant use is considered to be that which requires the most parking of those sharing the parking facilities 2 up to ninety percent 90% of parking spaces required for uses such as public auditoriums bowling alleys nightclubs movie theaters and similar predominately evening uses may be shared with such uses such as banks offices and similar predominately daytime uses 3 up to ninety percent 90% of the parking spaces required for such uses such as houses of worship and other uses exclusively in operation during the weekend may be shared with such uses as medical offices banks and other similar uses predominately in operation on weekdays other
