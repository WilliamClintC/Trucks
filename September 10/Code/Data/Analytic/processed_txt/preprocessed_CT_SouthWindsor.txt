circulation pattern is designed to minimize safety hazards for residents particularly with respect to access into and out of the building 4 site design adequately reflects that residents needs are accommodated as an integral part of the site design eg recreation parking storage access such that the site functions as an integrated site article 4  commercial and industrial zones 10 5 the proposed mixed use furthers the purpose stated in paragraph a 6 there is no undue concentration of highdensity residential development in any areaneighborhood the commission shall grant all approvals subject to such conditions and safeguards as will carry out the expressed purpose of these regulations all requirements of the underlying zone that are not expressly altered by the above requirements must be met buckland road gateway development zone gd  purpose the purpose of the buckland road gateway development zone is to create an attractive entrance to south windsor this zone should foster highquality development of businesses and sites with careful attention to the appearance of buildings and surrounding site integration of historic structures where possible and professional landscaping within the zone it is beneficial to the economic viability of the zone and the overall highquality of the area to introduce a multifamily residential component at certain but not all locations to create a fullyintegrated mixeduse land use pattern to accomplish the purpose of the zone access management will be an integral part of site planning with interior service drives and limited curb cuts to facilitate traffic flow and safety in recognition of the fact that it is generally site appearance and performance that determine whether a use is desirable or undesirable and that there will be desirable uses that have not been developed yet permitted uses will be those that are able to meet all of the standards enumerated below and in other applicable sections of these regulations  definitions development area plan is defined as the site area within boundaries shown on the submitted general plan of development or final plan that illustrates the proposed development and its physical impacts on surrounding area facilities and systems in accordance with the regulations the intent of this is to illustrate the contiguous area for the purposes of creating a new mixed use development drivethrough facility an establishment that by design encourages or permits customers to receive services or obtain goods while remaining in their motor vehicles human scaled site and building design elements that are dimensionally related to pedestrians such as small building spaces with individual entrances eg as is typical of downtowns and main street developments  larger buildings which have articulation and detailing to break up large masses  narrower streets with tree canopies  smaller parking areas or parking areas broken up into small components with landscaping  and pedestrian amenities such as sidewalks plazas outdoor seating shorter light poles usually 1014 weather protection eg awnings or canopies and similar features these features are all generally smaller in scale than those which are primarily intended to accommodate automobile traffic pedestrian amenities pedestrian amenities serve as informal gathering places for socializing resting and enjoyment of a particular area and contribute to a walkable center typical amenities include extra wide sidewalks street trees sitting spaces weather protection awnings or canopies pedestrian scale lighting bus stop seating sidewalk dining etc pedestrianfriendlypedestrianoriented development which is designed with an emphasis primarily on the sidewalk and pedestrian access to and within the site and building rather than on auto access and parking areas the building is generally placed close to the street and the main entrance is oriented to the article 4  commercial and industrial zones 11 street sidewalk there are generally windows or display cases along building faades which face the street strip commercial center strip commercial centers are typically developed owned and maintained as a unit and have large parking lots in front with manymost of the stores arranged in a straight row and an automobilecentric design proliferation results in a pattern of development wherein commercial development is strung along an arterial thoroughfare  general concepts a site planning is an essential criterion of the buckland road gateway development zone sites developed under this zone are intended to be carefully planned both within the sites own boundaries and in relation to surrounding properties and the entire buckland road gateway development zone it is the express intention of these buckland road gateway development zone regulations to result in developments that do not resemble typical strip commercial centers all developments shall be human scaled pedestrian friendlypedestrian oriented developments with pedestrian amenities b retail developments depend on high visibility from major public streets in turn their design determines much of the character and attractiveness of major streetscapes the marketing interests of many corporations even with strong imagemaking design by professional designers can be potentially detrimental to community aspirations and sense of place when they result in developments that do not contribute to or integrate with the town in a positive way in recognition of this the gateway zone includes special standards and guidelines for retail developments these standards and objectives require a basic level of architectural variety compatible scale and mitigation of negative impacts the standards are by no means intended to limit creativity  it is the towns hope that they will serve as a useful tool for design professionals engaged in sitespecific design the purpose of these standards and guidelines is to augment existing criteria with more specific interpretations that apply to the design of retail store developments c all buildings must be individually designed by registered architects for compatibility with south windsor and must conform to the provisions of architectural and design review the type of design excellence described in is usually not obtained with stereotypical franchisetype building designs applicants must avoid submitting stereotypical franchisetype buildings unless the building truly demonstrates architectural excellence d this zone is intended to encourage smaller sites to combine with other sites in order to provide largerscale sites and developments as an incentive to promote combining of properties a 5% impervious coverage bonus will be granted for nonconforming lot consolidation per paragraph d e access management will be required on all sites in order to reduce the number of driveway cuts onto buckland road and mitigate the

4 john fitch boulevard 5 sullivan avenue 6 deming street from manchester town line to the intersection of deming street and the start of oakland road rri291 overlay zone rroz  purpose a the area bounded by chapel road burnham street and long hill road is generally characterized by existing singlefamily residences including historic structures and vacant interior property with many constraints to development such as wetlands electric transmission easements and i291 itself these constraints generally limit the vacant lands suitability for residential development yet the existing character of that area generally precludes largescale industrial and commercial development in recognition of these contrasting development characteristics and in order to preserve the residential and historic character of the existing neighborhoods the purpose of the rri291 overlay zone is to allow the development of smallscale commercial and institutional uses that are compatible with the residential character of the area in such characteristics as 1 architectural character  2 general aesthetics of the site  3 operational restrictions such as daytime operating hours  and 4 site and building scale and massing b the overlay zone is not intended to in any way limit or negate the uses permitted in the underlying zone article 5  overlay zones 11  general concepts a permitted uses in this zone will be limited to those lowintensity lowcustomerclient turnover uses that can clearly demonstrate compatibility with residential uses without relying heavily on buffering and screening to achieve that compatibility although bufferingscreening will be required as appropriate uses with highclient turnover are not allowed because the higher trip generation is not compatible with residential neighborhoods b architectural scale must be similar to the scale of the surrounding existing development including building height architectural design including roof design must be compatible with surrounding architectural design c all development must exhibit a high standard of quality in construction detail materials and appearance d site planning is an essential criterion sites developed under this zone are intended to be carefully planned both within the sites own boundaries and in relation to surrounding properties e all development will be sensitive to environmentallyregulated

enjoy nature with an opportunity to walk jog cross country ski bicycle picnic fish wade sit or otherwise spend time in a natural setting in addition to these passive activities these requirements recognize the importance of areas which may be used for active recreational activities which include competitive sports  and the importance of the towns agricultural areas which the town strives to preserve in an effort to provide locally grown fruits and vegetables dairy products trees shrubbery and similar products the open space and recreation requirements outlined herein are based on the town plan of conservation and development the agricultural land preservation master plan the open space master plan and the recreation master plan together with areas which can unite or link important open space areas these linkages are formed by joining undeveloped and undevelopable land areas including existing open spaces areas with developmental restrictions such as streams wetlands and severe
