development districts  purpose the purpose of the planned unit development district pud is to offer an alternative to development as outlined in the residential commercial and industrial use districts of this pud district will and to provide for greater flexibility in the development and redevelopment process as compared to development under the definitive and precise requirements of the conventional use districts the pud district must demonstrate that the particular areas to be developed can offer greater value to the community and can better meet the community s health welfare and safety requirements than if those same areas were to be developed in a single purpose zone the pud process provides for a joint planningdesign effort by developers and city officials development in a single purpose use district establishes maximum limits within which developers must perform the planned unit development may be multipurpose in nature so that not only may it be residential commercial or industrial but also it may contain a combination of these uses it is not the intent of this allow for reductions or waivers to the standard use district requirements solely for the purpose of increasing overall density allowing the use of private streets or allowing development that otherwise could not be approved  findings the city council finds that the city and its residents will benefit by creating a process which permits planned unit development district which will allow for greater flexibility in the development of a parcel or property by tailoring the development to the site and neighborhood such benefits include but are not limited to 1 provides a flexible approach to development which is in harmony with the purpose and intent of the citys comprehensive plan and zoning   2 more creative efficient and effective use of land open space and public facilities of land uses  3 create a sense of place and provide more interaction among people  4 increase economic vitality and expand market opportunities  zoning of prior lake  1106p2 5 support longterm economic stability by strengthening the tax base job market and business opportunities  6 increase transportation options such as walking biking or bussing  7 provide opportunities for life cycle housing to all ages  8 provide more efficient and effective use of streets utilities and public facilities that support high quality land use development at a lesser cost  9 enhanced incorporation of recreational public and open space components in the development which may be made more useable and be more suitably located than would otherwise be provided under conventional development procedures the pud district also encourages the developer to convey property to the public over and above required dedications by allowing a portion of the density to be transferred to other parts of the site  10 preserves and enhances desirable site characteristics and open space and protection of sensitive environmental features including but not limited to steep slopes wetlands and trees where applicable the pud should also encourage historic preservation reuse and redevelopment of existing buildings  11 high quality of design compatible with surrounding land uses including both existing and planned  definition a planned unit development  pud is a development of land that is under

buildings open spaces and other site features and improvements a planned unit development is built according to a detailed final development plan as approved by the city council  authorization approval of a planned unit development district may allow 1 variety within a comprehensive site design concept a mixture of land uses housing types and densities 2 sensitivity through the departure from the strict application of required setbacks yard areas lot sizes minimum house sizes minimum requirements and other performance standards associated with traditional zoning planned unit development can maximize the development potential of land while remaining sensitive to its unique and valuable natural characteristics 3 efficiency the consolidation of areas for recreation and reductions in street lengths and other utilityrelated expenses 4 density transfer the project density may be clustered basing density on number of units per acre versus specific lot dimensions zoning of prior lake  1106p3 5 district integration the combination of uses which are allowed in separate zoning districts such as a mixed residential allows both densities and unit types to be varied within the project b mixed residential with increased density acknowledging the greater sensitivity of pud projects regulation provides increased density on the property if a pud is utilized c mixed land uses with the integration of compatible land uses within the project 1106 500 allowed uses uses allowed within a pud district are limited to those uses allowed in the use district which is consistent
