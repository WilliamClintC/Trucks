ranch outdoor recreation zoning district pending study public hearing and specific zoning district classification 212018 district purposes a agricultureforestry zoning district af purpose the purpose of the agricultureforestry af zoning district is to foster agriculture and forestry land uses while providing for limited lowdensity residential land uses which will not conflict with farm and forest practices nor place inappropriate demands on rural public services nor promote the indiscriminate conversion of farm and forest land to other uses b farm ranch and outdoor recreation zoning district fr purpose this classification is intended to permit current agricultural outdoor recreation and other open land uses to be maintained and at the same time to set minimum standards for the development of similar new uses in order that this open zoning district be protected against spasmodic disorderly and indiscriminate development until such time as another appropriate use of the land in this zoning district has been determined it is also intended that newly annexed areas of the city be placed in this classification until land use studies determine the character and appropriate use of such areas c suburban residential zoning district sr purpose this classification is to create and protect a permanent single family residential neighborhood at a very low density where properly located and controlled specified rural uses including pasturage of livestock may be allowed because large areas are contained within lots in this zoning district the demand for parking is to be satisfied by spaces located entirely on private property public improvements are to be designed to serve the rural low intensity uses permitted in this zoning district  for this reason and because some uses permitted in the sr zoning district may not be compatible with more intensive zoning districts the following conditions shall apply to the designation of land in the sr zoning district 1 local streets developed to a reduced standard specially applicable in the sr zoning district shall not provide primary access to development with a higher density than permitted in the sr zoning district 2 the minimum size of an sr zoning district shall be ten 10 acres 3 the sr zoning district shall be located only in areas specifically designated a or alr on the comprehensive plan map because the sr zoning district may interfere with higher density more efficient land use it should be applied where such interference would be unlikely such as in areas primarily rural in character and not close to schools public facilities and shopping areas the sr zoning district should not be applied where the reduced street standards permitted would interfere with present or future transportation needs for the area in which the sr zoning district is proposed 4 after zoning and development of land in the sr zoning district occurs changes from this zoning district can only take place concurrently with or after redevelopment of streets and utilities to standards applicable in the proposed zoning district for which the person is applying d low density single family residential zoning district r1 purpose the r1 zoning district is a low density residential zone appropriate where the following circumstances are present 1 single family dwellings predominate in the area 2 the physical character of the area does not lend it to more intense development either by virtue of irregular topography restricted access division of the land into subdivision lots of a size greater than the minimum lot size required by this zoning district or the application of the plan policies to the land in question e moderate density single family residential zoning district r2 purpose the r2 zoning district is a moderate density residential zone appropriate where the following circumstances are present 1 single family dwellings predominate 2 the terrain is not harshly irregular and smaller lot sizes can be accommodated without extensive earthwork 3 utilities and other public facilities are adequate for the densities allowed 4 existing lot development patterns and policies embodied in the plan will also guide application of this zoning district f medium density residential zoning district r3 purpose the r3 zoning district provides for an increase over the density allowed by the r2 zoning district by permitting different types of housing construction it is appropriate where activity levels are moderate terrain permits construction of somewhat larger structures and where public systems and neighborhood facilities can accommodate a greater intensity of land use as guided by the comprehensive plan g multiple family residential zoning district r4 purpose the r4 zoning district provides for the most intense residential land uses permitted in the community it is to be applied where activity levels are high and adequate public facilities are available especially near the university of idaho campus or the city central business zoning district adequate transportation access should be given high priority in determining the appropriate location for r4 zoning districts h residentialoffice zoning district ro purpose the ro zoning district is a moderately intensive zone including both offices and high density housing it serves as a transitional zoning district between residential zoning districts and commercial or industrial zoning districts the ro zoning district is appropriately applied in the following circumstances 1 on the perimeter of commercial or industrial districts where they abut residential land uses  2 where transportation network use is greater than desirable for lower density residential uses  3 where landforms create sites which are reasonably accessible by transportation systems and which are buffered from nearby residential areas  and 4 where the development patterns in a neighborhood will allow development of moderate intensity to occur without producing adverse visual impact or harm to the transportation network i neighborhood business zoning district nb purpose the nb zoning district is the lowest intensity commercial zoning district permitted within the city it is intended to apply to areas of less than two 2 acres where commercial services may be provided in convenient locations serving adjoining residential neighborhoods rather than the community as a whole the commercial services permitted are those where traffic generation access requirements impacts of lighting neighborhood need for services and noise production will be compatible with residential uses the nb zoning district is appropriately applied in the following circumstances 1 where local commercial facilities will serve the everyday needs of a limited neighborhood area  2 where activity levels associated with small scale office development can be accommodated or tolerated by surrounding land uses and existing public services  3 where a neighborhood core is identified which is easily accessible by pedestrian or vehicular circulation  and 4 where such commercial development will result in minimal interference with residential uses in the vicinity of the nb zoning district j research technology and office zoning district rto purpose the rto zoning district is intended to create a high quality professional environment for research technology office and other primary job industries to be established within the city of moscow this zoning district is appropriate where adequate infrastructure is available and where neighboring land uses will enhance or not detract from the intent and uses of the rto zoning district the rto zoning district should be located adjacent to or in close proximity to arterial or collector streets k central business zoning district cb purpose the principal purpose of the cb zoning district is to provide a location for groups of compatible commercial uses having the common characteristic of not involving more than incidental and minimal assembly fabrication or storage of commodities  for example establishments dispensing retail commodities and those providing professional and personal services to the individual the cb zoning district is the most intensive commercial zoning district to promote pedestrian use unbroken streetlevel commercial frontage is encouraged in this zoning district l general business zoning district gb purpose the principal purpose of the gb zoning district is to provide for the location and grouping of compatible retail enterprises having the common characteristics of dispensing commodities providing professional services or providing personal services to the individual but which do not involve more than incidental or limited assembly fabrication

to community parking facilities indicates a need for onsite parking 2 at dispersed commercial centers where the grouping of retail and office uses is appropriate to serve community or regional needs m motor business zoning district mb purpose the mb zoning district is intended to provide for the location and grouping of compatible uses having similar operation as they involve enterprises which depend primarily on the transient motor vehiclebased trade by concentrating such uses the city intends to increase public convenience when utilizing such services and within the regulation to allow such activities to render the maximum service n industrial zoning district i purpose the i zoning district is designed to encourage sound industrial development in the city by providing a protective environment primarily for such development o urban mixed commercial zoning district umc purpose the principal purpose of the umc zoning district is to provide a location for urban mixed development
