related to the degree of incompatibility with permitted uses and the amount of investment typically associated with nonconformities of that type in the cases of nonconforming uses of land nonconforming uses in structures designed for a permitted use and nonconforming signs the degree of incompatibility is frequently great the investment is comparatively small and the economic life is short in these cases elimination of the nonconformity is required after a relatively short but reasonable amortization period in the case of nonconforming uses in structures not designed for any conforming use the degree of incompatibility is also frequently great but so too is the investment and economic life of the structure in such cases while eventual elimination is required a more

location of the land to be dedicated shall be determined by the board of trustees in consideration of the suitability of such land for park purposes or development the relationship of such land to population concentrations and the proximity of such land to other park or recreational lands in making its determination the board of trustees shall consider that the principal need of village residents is for park land in such location and of such size as to be suitable not only for passive and playground recreational purposes but also as playing fields for baseball soccer and similar activities to this end park land to be dedicated should be consolidated or when possible combined with existing park land rather than fragmented parcels 3 minimum size of land no land to be dedicated

lieu of dedication of some or all of the park land required herein if the board of trustees determines that one of the following criteria is metin making its determination the board of trustees shall be guided by the principal consideration that park land should be dedicated under possible circumstances and fees in lieu of such dedication should be made only when such dedication cannot be accomplished 1 when the board of trustees determines that because a development is small the resulting required land dedication is too small to be of any practical use to the village for park purposes  or 2 when the board of trustees determines that the available land is inappropriate and unusable for any practical park purpose  or 3 when the board of trustees determines that existing park property nearby is adequate to serve the needs of the proposed development if it is expanded or enhanced by use of funds paid in lieu of dedication of additional park land b contribution to be used for park purposes every cash contribution in lieu of park land dedication shall be held in trust by the village solely for the acquisition of park land or the development or enhancement of park facilities funds so held in trust shall be kept separate from all other funds and shall be accounted for in the appropriate manner c amount of required contribution all cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the land that may be acquired by the village for park purposes the board of trustees finds and determines that the present fair market value of land that may be acquired by the village for park purposes is one hundred twenty thousand dollars $12000000 per acre 6 combination dedication and payment in lieu of dedication the board of trustees in the exercise of its discretion may approve a combination of land dedication and payment of a cash contribution in lieu of a land dedication under the following circumstances a the subdivision or development does not have sufficient or adequate land to meet the dedication requirements hereunder that portion of the land within the subdivision or development that is adequate or sufficient for park purposes shall be dedicated as a site and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated the required cash contribution shall be calculated proportionately based on the one hundred twenty thousand dollar $12000000 per acre value established herein b a major part of a local park site already has been acquired and only a small parcel of land is needed from the subdivider or developer to complete the park site such small parcel of land shall be dedicated and a cash contribution in lieu ofall additional land that would have been required to be dedicated shall be made the required cash contribution shall be calculated proportionately based on the one hundred twenty thousand dollar $12000000 per acre value established herein 7 calculation of ultimate population the table of estimated ultimate population incorporated herein as exhibit a is indicative of current and short range projected trends in family size for new construction and such table shall be used to calculate the amount of the required dedication of park land unless a written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or developer if such an

10510 from concept to building permit outline the following is a guide to the developer as to the typical flow of development the steps range from the first conceptual meeting at staff level all the way to the latter stages of development at a time when the actual building permit is issued  a preliminary stage 1 the developer takes a proposal to the staff development meeting here the village planner and director of building and zoning work in conjunction with the developer to put the proposal into a form agreeable with village ordinances in most cases one or two 2 meetings are necessary before the  sterling codifiers inc  416524 proposal is officially ready for the boards evaluation   amd  2 the engineer then begins review of the preliminary plans after the appropriate fees have been paid 3 after the proposal has met the requirements of the staff it is sent to the board committee of the whole the petitioner and staff identify the overall concepts as well as potential issues for the board members and the board committee can either send the proposal back to staff for further changes or forward the proposal to the village board 4 the proposal is then brought before the public at the village board meeting it is again scrutinized and either sent onward to the plan commission or brought back to the village board with requested changes 5 the proposal is then brought before the plan commission pc for a preliminary hearing preapplication review takes place and the zoning board of appeals is initiated if it is needed  this ends the preliminary preapplication process all tolled the process takes from thirty 30 to sixty 60 days to complete b formal application process 1 the proposal is then resumed at a board committee of the whole meeting the formal requests and specific concerns of the developer and staff are then examined upon the committee approval the development is sent to the village board 2 the village board then examines the development as a full body they may ask for specific changes before sending the proposal to the plan commission and a public hearing the plan commission reviews the development only if an annexation special use or otherwise a variation in the zoning2 andor subdivision ordinance is sought 3 formal public input then takes place at a public hearing of the plan commission the concerns of the general public elected officials and village staff are then brought up and the development is sent back to the staff and appropriate subcommittees to evaluate any concerns 4 the staff then meets with the developer at a staff development meeting usually the fourth or fifth of such meetings the staff and petitioner then refine the proposal using the public input as guidelines 5 if required a second meeting of the plan commission occurs at this point a second meeting is not usually needed  6 once the project has passed the plan commission the engineer with a more exact development can accurately measure the cost of the project the letter of credit which is fixed at a rate of one hundred ten percent 110% of site improvement costs ie grading sewer and water and sidewalks etc can be obtained also the remaining two percent 2% deposit for a total of 35 percent can be figured   amd  7 the development then goes before the committee of the whole where it is placed on the agenda of the next board meeting 8 upon the acceptance of the proposal by the committee of the whole the board sets dates for establishing an annexation agreement and if so required annexation hearing building permits may also be issued after staff meetings public discussion and board approval of both the annexation agreement and later public hearing the board will proceed to set a date for plat approval at this point the village attorney is consulted for
