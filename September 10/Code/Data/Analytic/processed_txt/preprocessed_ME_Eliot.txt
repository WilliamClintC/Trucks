may be relocated within the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of state law and the state of maine subsurface wastewater disposal rules rules or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said rules in no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be

potential for soil erosion the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties the location of the septic system and other onsite soils suitable for septic systems and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation when it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure the planning board shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation in accordance with section 4435p8h in addition the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation replanting shall be required as follows a trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree three feet in height for every tree removed if more than five trees are planted no one species of tree shall make up more than 50 percent of the number of trees planted replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland than the trees that were removed other woody and herbaceous vegetation and ground cover that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be reestablished an area at least

native vegetation andor ground cover that was disturbed destroyed or removed b where feasible when a structure is relocated on a parcel the original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses shrubs trees or a combination thereof 4 reconstruction or replacement any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland and which is removed or damaged or destroyed regardless of the cause by more than 50 percent of the market value of the structure before such damage destruction or removal may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained within 18 months of the date of said damage destruction or removal and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the water body tributary stream or wetland setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board in accordance with the purposes of this chapter in no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its nonconformity if the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure except as allowed pursuant to subsection 4432c1 above as determined by the nonconforming footprint of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location if the total footprint of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure when it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with subsection 4432c3 above any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed by 50 percent or less of the market value or damaged or destroyed by 50 percent or less of the market value of the structure excluding normal maintenance and repair may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained from the code enforcement officer within one year of such damage destruction or removal in determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the water setback to the greatest practical extent the planning board shall consider in addition to the criteria in paragraph c3 above the physical condition and type of foundation present if any 5 change of use of a nonconforming structure the use of a nonconforming structure may not be changed to another use unless the planning board after receiving a written application determines that the new use will have no greater adverse impact on the water body tributary stream or wetland or on the subject or adjacent properties and resources than the existing use in determining that no greater adverse impact will

structure in or on which a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period exceeding one year or which is superseded by a conforming use may not again be devoted to a nonconforming use except that the planning board may for good cause shown by the applicant grant up to a one year extension to that time period this provision shall not apply to the resumption of a use of a residential structure provided that the structure has been used or maintained for residential purposes during the preceding fiveyear period 3 change of use an existing nonconforming use may be changed to another

piers exceeding 40 feet in length reflectors shall also be affixed to each side of the pier at a frequency of one per 20 feet note 2 the purpose of the limit of paragraph 10 is to maintain a reasonable area of open water in the public interest to sustain activities not specifically related to simple transiting of the area in safety these activities include such things as cruising fishing sailboarding swimming waterskiing etc which require open unobstructed water and should not be eliminated for private interest limiting intrusion from either bank to 25 percent of the waterway width at mean low water or halfway to the deep channel centerline will maintain the central 50 percent of the available width as open water an even split between public and private interest note 3 the purpose of paragraph 12 is to avoid conflicts between neighboring waterfront property owners concerning the spacing of projects relative to riparian lines riparian lines refers to the demarcations of rights in the water associated with owning waterfront property the united states army corps of engineers reports that these conflicts generally concern access to piers and floats for mooring vessels to resolve these conflicts the army corps of engineers requires a minimum setback from the riparian boundary of 25 feet this is based on the fact that a median sized recreational vessel length is in the range of 32 feet a minimum turning distance for such a vessel is 15 times the vessel length or 48 feet rounded off to 50 feet each adjacent facility then provides onehalf the required turning distance which is an equitable distribution of the resource applying the standards of paragraph 12 the outside dimensions of floats and pilings located across the front of a pier will not usually exceed the effective lot frontage on the water body minus 50 feet note 4 for the purpose of measuring setbacks of piers and appurtenant floats from adjacent lots in this section riparian lines are to be determined as follows draw a straight line the baseline between the two corners of each lot where the edge of the lot meets the highwater line from these two corners extend parallel lines towards the water at right angles to the baseline usually the parallel lines from the lot corners on adjacent lots will not coincide but will form a pie shape an imaginary line drawn to bisect this pie shaped area is the riparian or boundary between each adjacent lot these riparian lines should project on either side of the footprint of the pier and are the line from which the setbacks are to be measured where the location of the applicants riparian lines is unclear due to the geography of the water body they shall be determined by the planning board as part of the review of the proposed pier method of establishing riparian lines d campgrounds campgrounds shall conform to the minimum requirements imposed under state licensing procedures and the following 1 campgrounds shall contain a minimum of
