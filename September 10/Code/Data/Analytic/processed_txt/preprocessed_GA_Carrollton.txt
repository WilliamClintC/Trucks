total   2989 percent and are allowed to discharge up to 250 mgl bod 5 and tss without surcharge a surcharge is applied to user charges for wastewater strengths in excess of 250 mgl bod 5 or tss to discourage industries from discharging high strength wastes the surcharge is a very effective mechanism for achieving voluntary compliance and the industries in the city rarely pay surcharges a prohibition limit of 500 mgl for bod5 and tss is in place to guard against a single industry discharging extremely high strength waste and potentially disrupting the treatment process fines and other sanctions are applied if prohibition limits are exceeded surcharge limits are derived as follows ind bod ind flow + dom bod domestic flow   total bod total flow allowable industrial bod   total bod

resources with significant development constraints due to flooding erosion and soil limitations 2 in their natural state wetlands serve man and nature they provide habitat areas for fish wildlife and vegetation  water quality maintenance and pollution control  flood control  natural resource education  scientific study  and recreation opportunities in addition the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well being of many communities within the state 3 nationally a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining dredging filling excavating building pollution and other acts 4 piece meal or cumulative losses will over time destroy additional wetlands 5 damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare b purpose 1 the purpose of this district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality floodplain and erosion control groundwater recharge aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas 2 this ordinance is to promote wetland protection while taking into account varying ecological economic development recreation and aesthetic values 3 activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practical as determined permitting process c district delineation 1 these regulations shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the city 2 the wetland district overlay map adopted as part of this article shows the general location of wetlands according to the 1987 us fish and wildlife service national wetlands inventory maps 3 these maps shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands maps and are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto 4 the generalized wetlands maps do not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the us army corps of engineers as required by section 404 of the clean water act as amended 5 no local government action under this ordinance relieves the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements d wetland development permit requirements 1 no regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the city 2 if the area proposed for development is located near or in close proximity to a wetland protection district boundary as determined by the zoning administrator a us army corps of engineers determination shall be required 3 if the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site the local permit or permission will not be granted until a permit or a letter of permission is issued e permitted uses the following uses are permitted by right within the wetland district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures grading fill draining or dredging except as provided herein the activities listed in this section are exempted from regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual permit however under of the rivers and harbors act a permit may be required in some circumstances 1 forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in the clean water act 2 conservation or preservation of soil water vegetation fish or other wildlife provided the conservation or preservation does not affect waters of the state or of the

2 hazardous or sanitary landfills   water supply watershed district a findings of fact 1 in order to provide for the health safety welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured 2 the ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development landdisturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs 3 in addition stormwater runoff particularly from impervious surfaces can introduce toxins nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies making water treatment more complicated expensive and rendering water resources unusable industrial land uses that involve the manufacture use transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby drinking water supplies b purpose 1 the purpose of this section is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply for the city which will minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply and maintain the yield of the water supply watersheds 2 this article shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the city c district delineation the citys water supply watershed district is hereby designated and shall comprise the land areas which drain to the citys water supply intake on the little tallapoosa river the ridgelines of the respective watersheds and the boundary of a radius seven 7 miles upstream of the respective water supply intake define the boundary of this district this district shall be further delineated and defined on the water resource district map of the city which is hereby incorporated and made a part of this article by reference the following water supply watershed districts and reservoirs are hereby defined and boundaries shall be identified on the water resource district map 1 existing large water supply watersheds there are none at the present time 2 existing small water supply watersheds the little tallapoosa river watershed from the citys intake encompassing a 97 square mile area an intake for the city is located on this river this water supply watershed contains three 3 reservoirs see the table below either owned in whole or in part by the city all of which are covered in citys dnr approved reservoir management plan dated june 1992 because the three 3 reservoirs were placed in use at different times over the past forty 40 years use restrictions and buffer requirements vary for each reservoir table  c little tallapoosa river watershed reservoirs reservoir name purpose jurisdiction and buffers recreational restrictions sharpes creek storage impoundment to supplement raw water supply requirements during low flow drought periods the city controls the lake and a 100foot easement around the lake carroll county enforces a 150foot buffer has been in use since 1992 recreation for residence only no motors with open exhaust  however gasoline motors are allowed with a permit from the citys parks recreation and cultural arts department other restrictions listed in the reservoir management plan dated june 1992 lake carroll storage impoundment to supplement raw water supply requirements during low flow drought periods as a last resort only the city controls the lake and a small percentage of land for use as parkland and public docking has been in use since the mid1960s the city currently and will continue to enforce a 25foot buffer as mandated in the erosion and sedimentation control ordinance recreation for residence and the general public no motors with open exhaust  however gasoline motors are allowed with a permit from the citys parks recreation and cultural arts department other restrictions listed in the reservoir management plan dated june 1992 lake buckhorn storage impoundment to supplement raw water supply requirements during low flow drought periods the city controls the top 10 feet of water volume this was arranged us dept of agriculture soil conservation service in the mid1960s carroll county currently enforces a 25foot buffer the city does not own the reservoir land and does not exercise any regulations on the other uses of the reservoir therefore the city has no restrictions on the recreational uses of the reservoir and does not control a buffer strip around the reservoir 3 future water supply watersheds there are no planned large or small future water supply watersheds at the present time within the city limits of the city d permitted uses the following regulations shall apply to the little tallapoosa water supply watershed which is identified on the water resource district map all uses which are lawful at the time of adoption of this article shall be allowed to continue as lawful land uses until such

management plan criteria a prohibitions or restrictions on all or some of the following recreational uses swimming fishing boating docks and public access are addressed in the citys dnrapproved reservoir management plan dated june 1992 these restrictions were developed to protect the water quality of the three reservoirs for drinking purposes while optimizing their recreational benefits b because the three reservoirs were placed in use at different times over the past forty years use restrictions and buffer requirements vary for each reservoir c all new reservoirs shall have a buffer for a distance of 150 feet from the reservoir boundary and shall have prohibitions or restrictions on all or some of the recreational uses listed above to protect the water quality for drinking purposes d at such time in the future if the land use changes at lake carroll result in a more concentrated use of the lake then the city will address imposing more restrictive recreational measures in order to continue to preserve the water quality of the reservoir 3 small water supply watershed criteria the following criteria apply to all locations within the citys small water supply watershed
