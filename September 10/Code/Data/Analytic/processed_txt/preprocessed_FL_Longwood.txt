onoz are to an provide an optional incentivized opportunity to create new development projects on identified parcels which act as catalysts for redevelopment within the city projects developed consistent with the onoz will provide a mixture of uses integrated and programmable public open spaces provide a pedestrianfriendly environment in both design and scale  encourage creativity variety and excellence in project design and layout  and utilize a development review and approval process that meets these purposes without causing undue delays toward this end mixeduse projects containing commercial office residential uses and common spaces are required controls are applied to this district allowing flexibility but requiring integrated design within the development  limited access to the existing public roadways and integrated vehicular and pedestrian facilities within the development and between adjacent developments onoz developments will be designed to ensure compatibility with and minimum impact upon existing and future residential development in the area the district is not intended to be accomplished in a fragmented lotbylot fashion or developed with a single type of land use the commercial office and residential components will be developed concurrently in order to insure the achievement of a development with multiple uses the design of onoz developments should be predominated by building and landscape design elements that encourage connectivity and which collectively create a village square marketplace or main street atmosphere onoz developments will therefore be developed with a variable but coordinated architectural theme having equal emphasis on pedestrian movement and vehicular circulation the overall arrangement of buildings should create an internal traffic flow and focus for both vehicles and pedestrians b objectives the onoz provisions are designed to 1 permit outstanding and innovative mixed use development with a building orientation toward streets and sidewalks  provide for an integration of housing types and accommodation of changing lifestyles within neighborhoods  and provide for design which encourages internal and external convenient and comfortable travel by foot bicycle and transit strategies as narrow streets modest setbacks front porches connected streets multiple connections to nearby land uses and mixed uses 2 provide flexibility to meet changing needs technologies economics and consumer preferences 3 promote the integration and enhancement of existing and outstanding landscape features and scenic vistas 4 lower development and building costs by permitting smaller networks of utilities a network of narrower streets and the use of more economical development patterns and shared facilities 5 achieve overall coordinated building and facility relationships and infill development and eliminate the negative impacts of unplanned and piecemeal development 6 enhance the combination and coordination of architectural styles building forms and building relationships within the development 7 require the use of traditional qualityoflife design features such as pedestrian scale parking located to the side or rear of buildings narrow streets connected streets terminated vistas front porches recessed garages alleys aligned building faades that face the street and formal landscaping along streets and sidewalks 8 promotes the incorporation of sustainable design practices including alternative energy sources increases walkability encourages biking and fosters choice in transportation green building

objectives a the legislature of the state of florida has authorized and delegated in fs ch 125 counties and fs ch 166 municipalities the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city commission of the city of longwood does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations b the flood hazard areas of the city of longwood are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare c these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages d it is the purpose of this section to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights and velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage throughout their intended life span  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands e the objectives of this section are to 1 protect human life health and to eliminate or minimize property damage  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines roadways and bridges and culverts located in floodplains  6 maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  and 7

program a purpose and intent the purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors to be known as the proportionate fairshare program as required by and in a manner consistent with fs 16 b applicability the proportionate fairshare program shall apply to all developments in the city that impact a road segment in the city concurrency management system and have been notified of a failure to achieve transportation concurrency on a roadway segment or segments the proportionate fairshare program does not apply to developments of regional impact dris using proportionate share under fs 12 developments meeting the de minimis standards under fs 6 or to developments exempted from concurrency as previously provided in section  of this chapter c general requirements 1 an applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fairshare contribution pursuant to the following requirements a the proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations b the city fiveyear capital improvement program cip includes a transportation improvements that upon completion will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development 2 the city may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency proportionate fairshare program by contributing to an improvement that upon completion will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development but is not contained in the cip where one of the following apply a the city adds the improvement to the fiveyear cip no later than the next regular update to qualify for consideration under this section the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the city engineer and must determined to be financially feasible b if the funds in the adopted city fiveyear cip are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the concurrency management system the city may require a proportionate fairshare payment for another improvement which will in the opinion of the city significantly benefit the impacted transportation system the improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fairshare component must be adopted into the fiveyear cip of the comprehensive plan at the next annual capital improvements element update 3 any improvement project proposed to meet the developers fairshare obligation must meet generally accepted design standards for the state of florida and the city d application process 1 upon notification of a failure to satisfy transportation concurrency applicants can submit a proposed proportionate fairshare calculation to the city engineer for review 2 pursuant to fs 16e proposed proportionate fairshare mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the strategic intermodal system requires the concurrence of the florida department of transportation fdot 3 when a proportionate fairshare calculation is deemed sufficient and eligible a development order will be prepared between the city and the applicant the stipulations of the development order shall include but not be limited to the amount of payment description of work and timing of payment e determining proportionate fairshare obligation 1 proportionate fairshare mitigation for concurrency impacts may include without limitation separately or collectively private funds contributions of land and

dedication for all or a portion of the proportionate fairshare payment credit for the dedication of the nonsite related rightofway shall be valued on the date by appropriate city staff or at the option of the applicant by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city the applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city if the estimated value of the rightofway dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the cityestimated total proportionate fairshare obligation for that development then the applicant must also pay the difference f appropriation of fairshare revenues 1 proportionate fairshare revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the city capital improvements program in the event of a proportionate fairshare mitigation proposal for a transportation facility under the jurisdictional authority of seminole county or the florida department of transportation appropriation of funds to capital improvements projects shall be coordinated with the appropriate jurisdiction 2 in the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the cip then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of

hardship would otherwise occur and to provide for special exceptions two forms of hardship are addressed 1 section  addresses hardship that would be caused if nonconforming uses or structures were required to immediately come into compliance with this development code  and 2 section  addresses the hardship that may be caused in particular cases by the imposition of the development s development

noncomforming usesstructures  nonconforming uses nonconforming uses shall mean and refer to those uses of real property and the characteristics of such uses that were lawful prior to the adoption of the longwood development any subsequent amendments thereto but are at present prohibited or otherwise further restricted under the current longwood development intent of this section is to permit but not encourage such nonconforming uses to continue until such uses are removed as required by this section a nonconforming use may continue so long as such use remains lawful outside the context of the longwood development compliance with the following provisions is maintained 1 enlargement increase intensification alteration a nonconforming use shall not be enlarged intensified increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land or water than was occupied at the time of the citys adoption or amendment of the applicable longwood development regulation or restriction this section shall not be interpreted to prohibit a nonconforming use from being reduced in intensity size or scope  however once such nonconforming use is reduced intensification or reexpansion beyond such reduced scope shall not be permitted beyond what is currently provided for in the longwood development the ultimate goal of this section being to phase out nonconforming uses over time 2 relocation a nonconforming use shall not be moved or otherwise relocated in whole or in part to any portion of a lot or parcel other than that which was occupied by such use at the time of the citys adoption or amendment of the applicable longwood development regulation or restriction 3 discontinuance a nonconforming use shall be deemed abandoned and become an illegal use subject to all extant provisions of the longwood development such use is discontinued or otherwise lapses for a period of 365 days or more discontinuance shall be determined by any of the following if the business relocates if there is an interruption in utility service a failure to pay applicable business taxes or the expiration of a business tax receipt the absence of signage indicating the existence of the nonconforming use on the property or any other relevant evidence indicating discontinuation of the nonconforming use for the requisite time period in determining the date of discontinuance the date of the first indication

compliance with the following provisions is maintained 1 destruction a nonconforming structure that is destroyed or demolished by any means so as to require substantial improvements shall not be reconstructed unless such structure is constructed or otherwise reconstructed in conformity with all extant provisions of the longwood development the purposes of this section  and all subsections thereunder substantial improvement shall mean and refer to any repair reconstruction renovation rehabilitation addition expansion or other improvement of a structure the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the fair market value of the structure either at the time just before the commencement of such improvement  or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored at the time just before the damage occurred fair market value shall be determined for the year in which a substantial improvement is commenced by reference to the official tax assessment rolls for that year or by an appraisal by a qualified independent appraiser the extent of any such damage shall be determined by the building official in consultation with the community development director by comparing the estimated cost of repairs or restoration with the fair market value the cost of repeated improvements to a nonconforming structure which improvements are implemented incrementally over any period of time since the effective date of this development code shall be combined to determine whether the substantial improvement threshold has been reached 2 enlargement or extensions to nonconforming structures nonconforming structures used in a manner conforming to the provisions of the longwood development be enlarged or extended without regard to substantial improvement thresholds

there is an interruption in utility service a failure to pay applicable business taxes or the expiration of a business tax receipt the absence of signage indicating the existence of the use on the property or any other relevant evidence indicating the intent to discontinue the use in determining the date of discontinuance the date of the first indication of abandonment shall be relied upon if such compliance is physically impossible due to the size of a site or the physical layout of structures on or adjoining the site the property shall nonetheless be brought into compliance to the

bonuses b objectives the pd provisions are intended to promote flexibility of design and integration of uses and structures while at the same time retaining in the city commission the absolute authority to establish limitations and regulations thereon for the benefit of the public health welfare and safety by encouraging flexibility in the proposals which may be considered while at the same time retaining control in the city commission over the approval or disapproval of such proposals the pd provisions are designed to 1 permit outstanding and innovative residential and nonresidential developments with a building orientation generally toward streets and sidewalks  provide for an integration of housing types and accommodation of changing lifestyles within neighborhoods  and provide for design which encourages internal and external convenient and comfortable travel by foot bicycle and transit strategies as narrow streets modest setbacks front porches connected streets multiple connections to nearby land uses and mixed uses 2 provide flexibility to meet changing needs technologies economics and consumer preferences 3 preserve to the greatest extent possible and utilize in a harmonious fashion existing and outstanding landscape features and scenic vistas 4 lower development and building costs by permitting smaller networks of utilities a network of narrower streets and the use of more economical development patterns and shared facilities 5 achieve overall coordinated building and facility relationships and infill development and eliminate the negative impacts of unplanned and piecemeal development 6 enhance the combination and coordination of architectural styles building forms and building relationships within the development 7 promote the use of traditional
