of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the

an engineering report prepared by a qualified professional engineer licensed to perform such professional engineering services in the state of texas which demonstrates that the number of service units for the new development will be less than those indicated by the land use equivalency table the city may prescribe the methodology for making alternative determinations of service units guidelines in addition to the following standards a if the director determines that the size of the water meter in the land use equivalency table is not indicative of actual service demand the director may adjust the number of lues based on a smaller or larger sized meter which more accurately reflects the flow rate and the system pressure conditions b if the director determines that the number of vehicle miles to be generated by the new development during the pm peak hour is substantially different from that stated for such development in the land use equivalency table the director may establish the number of vehicle miles based upon his interpretation of a traffic impact study prepared in accordance with city standards 2 in determining the number of service units the following rules shall apply a each new freestanding building requires a new water meter except as provided in subsection 2b below b where a site is redeveloped clearance and reconstruction no new lues will be attributed to such redevelopment provided that the water meter is of the same size as the development previously occupying the site if meter size is increased the number of lues will be based upon the increase in capacity of the meter c existing buildings or land uses may be expanded using existing meter service no lues will be attributed to such development if the water meter size remains the same if the meter size is increased the number lues will be based upon the increase in capacity of the meter d calculation of the number of service units for water and wastewater impact fees generally shall be

not generate the need for water or wastewater service no lues will be attributable to such use or structure f if a fire demand meter tap is purchased for a property the meter size utilized to calculate the number of lues shall be the meter size which would provide only potable service to the property the reduced meter size shall then be utilized to calculate the number of lues 1 the meter types used to calculate the number of lues shall be simple compound or turbine meters 2 to avoid the use of fire flow volumes for potable usage the owner of any property for which a fire demand meter is purchased shall be required to execute a restrictive covenant on a form approved by the city attorney which covenant shall state that use of the fire demand meter for potable water needs in excess of that determined in establishing the meter size for impact fees shall be cause for collection of additional impact fees up to the actual size of the fire demand meter said covenant shall be executed prior to the purchase of the fire demand meter and shall be filed in the deed records of the county 3 the land use equivalency table may be amended from time to time utilizing the amendment procedure in subsection r the official land use equivalency table shall be that last updated in accordance with the procedures in subsection r h impact fees per service unit 1 the maximum impact fee per service unit for each service area shall be computed by dividing the total eligible costs of capital improvements in the service area identified in the impact fee capital improvements plan for that category of capital improvements reduced by the amount of the credit for that portion of ad valorem or utility service revenues as the case may be to be generated by new service units for the payment of the improvements included in the capital improvements plan for the service area during the tenyear life of the plan by the total number of service units anticipated within the service area based upon the land use assumptions for that service area maximum impact fees per service unit for each service area shall be established by category of capital improvements and shall be as set forth in schedule 1 attached hereto and made a part of these regulations by reference 2 the impact fee per service unit which is to be paid by each new development within a service area shall be that established by the city council as may be amended from time to time and shall be an amount less than or equal to the maximum impact fee per service unit established in subsection 1 above impact fees which are to be paid shall be as set forth in schedule 2 attached hereto and made a part of these regulations by reference 3 impact fee schedules 1 and 2 may be amended from time to time utilizing the amendment procedure set forth in subsection r i assessment of impact fees 1 assessment of the impact fee for any new development shall be made as follows a for land which is unplatted at the time of application for a building permit or tap purchase or for a new development which has received final plat approval prior to or on  for water and wastewater facilities or prior to the effective date of for roadway facilities and for which no replatting is necessary pursuant to the citys subdivision regulations prior to development assessment shall occur at the time application is made for the building permit or tap purchase whichever occurs first and shall be the amount of the maximum impact fee per service unit then in effect as set forth in schedule 1 b for a new development which is submitted for approval pursuant to the citys subdivision regulations after  for water and wastewater facilities or after the effective date of for roadway facilities or for which replatting results in an increase in the number of service units after such dates assessment shall be at the time of final plat approval and shall be the amount of the maximum impact fee per service unit then in effect as set forth in schedule 1 c because fire protection is of critical concern to the community as a whole water demand related solely to fire protection is not subject to assessment of an impact fee however if the director determines that the fire protection capacity of the fire demand meter is routinely utilized for potable purposes as evidenced by the registration of consumption recorded on the citys meterreading and billing systems the director shall calculate the meter size equivalent to such potable usage and assessment shall occur at the time of such determination and shall be the amount of the maximum impact fee per service unit then in effect as set forth in schedule 1 2 following initial assessment of the impact fee for a new development pursuant to subsection 1 above the amount of the maximum impact fee per service unit for that development cannot be increased unless the owner proposes to change the approved development by the submission of a new development application in which case the impact fee will be reassessed at the schedule 1 rate then in effect for such additional service units 3 following the lapse or expiration of approval of a new development a new assessment shall be performed at the time a new application for such development is filed j calculation of impact fees 1 at the time of tap purchase for new developments described in subsection 2 below at the time the director recalculates consumption of potable water as described in subsection i1c or at the time of application for a building permit for all other new developments the city shall compute the impact fees due for the new development in the following manner a the amount of each impact fee due shall be determined by multiplying the number of service units generated by the new development by the impact fee due per service unit for the service area using schedule 2 the number of service units shall be determined according to subsection g b the amount of each impact fee due shall be reduced by any allowable credits for that category of capital improvements in the manner provided in subsection l 2 the amount of each impact fee due for a new development shall not exceed an amount computed by multiplying the maximum impact fee per service unit under schedule 1 by the number of service units generated by the development 3 whenever the property owner proposes to increase the number of service units for a development the additional impact fees collected for such new service units shall be determined by using schedule 2 then in effect and such additional fee shall be collected either prior to or at the time of issuance of a new building permit or prior to or at the time of enlargement of the connection to the citys water or wastewater system k collection of impact fees 1 except as otherwise provided herein impact fees shall be collected prior to or concurrent with the issuance of a building permit for a new development 2 if the building permit for which an impact fee has been paid has expired and a new application is thereafter filed the impact fees due shall be computed using schedule 2 then in effect and previous payments of impact fees shall be credited against the new fees due 3 in the event that a water or wastewater tap is sold as a result of a conversion from an individual well or septic or other individual waste disposal system the appropriate fee shall be collected at the time of tap purchase except that the city may apply the following provisions upon written request of the applicant a upon approval by the director the applicant shall execute a contract for payment of the full amount of the fee within a reasonable amount of time  not to exceed a fiveyear period the applicant also shall record notice of capital recovery fee due in the records of the county clerk for dallas county or ellis county as the case may be and shall pay recording costs for such instrument b the contract shall provide for a deposit to be paid at the time of tap purchase with equal annual installments of the fee balance payable by the applicant on a monthly basis not to exceed sixty 60 installments together with interest payable on each installment from said date until paid in full c the interest rate shall be that rate paid to the city of treasury deposits at the time the contract is approved  provided however that the applicant shall have the privilege of paying all or any of said installments at any time before maturity thereof by paying the total amount of principal of such installment together with interest accrued thereon to the date of payment d if the property owner defaults in the payment of any of said installments of principal or interest as the same matures then at the option of the city or its assigns and while retaining all other remedies which the city may have to remedy such default the city may accelerate the amount then due under the contract and such sums together with reasonable attorneys fees and collection costs incurred shall become immediately due and payable l credits against impact fees 1 the city shall credit the present value of any arearelated facility pursuant to rules established in this section or pursuant to administrative guidelines promulgated by the city which has been dedicated or contributed to and received by the city including the value of rightsofways or capital improvements constructed pursuant to an agreement with the city against the amount of the impact fee due for that category of capital improvement the credit shall be associated with the plat of the property that is to be served by the capital improvement constructed 2 all credits against impact fees shall be based upon standards promulgated by the city which may be adopted as administrative guidelines including the following standards a no credit shall be given for the dedication or construction of siterelated facilities b no credit shall exceed an amount equal to the eligible costs of the improvement multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the impact fee per service unit due for the new development as computed using schedule 2 and the denominator of which is the maximum impact fee per service unit for the new development as computed using schedule 1 c the unit costs used to calculate credits shall not exceed those assumed for the capital improvements included in the impact fees capital improvements plan for the category of facility for which the impact fee is imposed d no credit shall be given for an oversized facility which is not identified within the applicable impact fees capital improvements plan unless the city agrees that such improvement supplies capacity to new developments other than the development paying the impact fee and provisions for credits are incorporated in an agreement for capital improvements pursuant to subsection u e in no event will the city reimburse the property owner or developer for a credit

stringent regulations a if national pretreatment standards categorical or otherwise more stringent than the discharge limits prescribed in this article are promulgated by the united states environmental protection agency for certain industries the more stringent national pretreatment standards will apply to the affected industrial user a violation of the more stringent national pretreatment standards will also be considered a violation of this article b applicability of more stringent discharge limits an industrial user within the city who discharges industrial waste ultimately received and treated by another governmental entity pursuant to a wholesale wastewater contract or a reciprocal agreement with the city is subject to the following additional rules 1 if the governmental entity has more stringent discharge limits than those prescribed by this article or by a discharge permit issued hereunder because the united states environmental protection agency requires the more stringent discharge limits as part of the governmental entitys wastewater pretreatment program the more stringent discharge limits shall prevail 2 the pwd is authorized to issue a discharge permit to an industrial user affected by subsection 1 to insure notice of and compliance with the more stringent discharge limits if the industrial user already has a discharge permit the pwd may amend the permit to apply and enforce the more stringent discharge limits an industrial user shall submit to the pwd an expected compliance date and an installation schedule if the more stringent discharge limits necessitate technological or mechanical adjustments to discharge facilities or plant processes 3 if the pwd chooses not to issue or amend a permit under subsection 2 the pwd shall notify the affected industrial user in writing of the more stringent discharge limits and their effective date regardless of whether or not a permit is issued or amended an industrial user shall be given a reasonable opportunity to comply with the more stringent discharge limits 4 the more stringent discharge limits cease to apply upon termination of the citys wholesale wastewater contract or reciprocal agreement with the governmental entity or upon modification or elimination of the limits by the government entity or the united states environmental protection agency the pwd shall take the appropriate action to notify the affected industrial user of an occurrence under this subsection 4 c variances in compliance dates the pwd may grant a variance in compliance dates to an industry when in the pwds opinion such action is necessary to achieve pretreatment or corrective measures in no case shall the pwd grant a variance in compliance dates to an industry affected by national categorical pretreatment standards beyond the compliance dates established by the united states environmental protection agency d authority to regulate the pwd may establish regulations not in conflict with this article or other laws to control the disposal and discharge of industrial waste into the wastewater system and to insure compliance with the citys pretreatment enforcement program with all applicable pretreatment regulations promulgated by the united states environmental protection agency the regulations established shall where applicable be made part of any discharge permit issued to an industrial user by the pwd  21103 affirmative defenses to discharge violations in an action brought in federal court only upset provision a for the purposes of this section upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user an upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation b an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph c below are met c a user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that 1 an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  2 the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  and 3 the user has submitted the following information to the pwd within twentyfour 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five 5 days a a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance  b the period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or if not corrected the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue  and c steps being taken andor planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance d in any enforcement proceeding the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof e users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards f users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails in an action brought in municipal or state court only act of god provision a an event that would otherwise be a violation that is caused solely by an act of god war strike riot or other catastrophe is not a violation b in any enforcement proceeding the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an act of god war strike riot or other catastrophe shall have the burden of proof c in the event that a and b above has been demonstrated the user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided  21103 bypass a for the purposes of this section 1 bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a users treatment facility 2 severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs c and d of this section c 1 if a user knows in advance of the need for bypass it shall submit prior notice to the pwd at least ten 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible 2 a user shall submit oral notice to the pwd of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twentyfour 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five 5 days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the pwd may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within twentyfour 24 hours d 1 bypass is prohibited and the pwd may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required under paragraph c of this section 2 the pwd may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the pwd determines that it will meet the three 3 conditions listed in paragraph d1 of this section  21103 wastewater treatment rates

amendatory of this has been codified as ch 20 art ii  20412047 at the discretion of the editor to facilitate classification and reference see also the editors note to art i of this chapter subsequently adopted feb 22 200 provided for the amendment of ch 20 art ii to read as herein set out cross reference administration ch 2  buildings and building regulations ch 4  trench safety program  4311 et seq  landscape regulations  4331 et seq purpose a this article is adopted to provide recreational areas and amenities in the form of neighborhood parks as a function of subdivision development in the city of cedar hill this article is enacted in accordance with the home rule powers of the city of cedar hill granted under the texas constitution and statutes of the state of texas including without limitation tex loc govt et seq and   et seq it is hereby declared that by the city council of the city of cedar hill that recreational areas in the form of neighborhood parks and related amenities and improvements are necessary and in the public welfare and that the only adequate procedure to provide for same is by integrating such a requirement into the procedure for planning and developing property of a residential subdivision in the city of cedar hill whether such development consists of new construction on previously vacant land or rebuilding and redeveloping existing residential areas b neighborhood parks are those parks providing for a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities and within convenient distances from a majority of the residences to be served thereby the standards for which are set forth in the cedar hill parks recreation and open space master plan or neighborhood areas the park zones established by the cedar hill parks and recreation department and shown on the official cedar hill parks recreation and open space master plan or neighborhood areas shall be prima facie evidence that any park located therein is within such a convenient distance from the majority of residences to be served thereby the cost of the neighborhood parks should be borne by the ultimate residential property owners who by reason of the proximity of their property to such parks shall be the primary beneficiaries of such facilities therefore the following requirements are adopted to effect such purposes  22200 general requirement dedication of land and payment of park development fee a prior to a plat being filed with the county clerk of dallas county texas or with the county clerk of ellis county texas for a development of a residential area within the city of cedar hill and in accordance with the planning and zoning ordinances of the city of cedar hill such plat shall contain a clear fee simple dedication of one 1 acre of land for each fifty 50 proposed dwelling units as used in this article a dwelling unit means each individual residence including individual residences in a multifamily structure designed andor intended for inhabitation by a single family any proposed plat submitted to the city of cedar hill for approval shall show the area proposed to be dedicated under this section the required land dedication of this section may be met by a payment in lieu of land where permitted by the city of cedar hill or required by other provisions in this article in the event a plat is not required the dedication of land required under this section shall be met prior to the issuance of a building permit b the city council of the city of cedar hill declares that development of an area less than five 5 acres for neighborhood park purposes is impractical therefore if fewer than two hundred fifty 250 dwelling units are proposed by a plat filed for approval the city council may require the developer to pay the applicable cash in lieu of land amount as provided in section 2043 hereto c in addition to the required dedication of land as set forth above there shall also be a park development fee paid to the city of cedar hill as a condition to subdivision plat approval or issuance of a building permit such park development fee shall be set from time to time by ordinance of the city council of the city of cedar hill sufficient to provide for the development of amenities and improvements on the dedicated land to meet the standards for a neighborhood park to serve the area in which the subdivision is located unless and until changed by resolution of the city council of the city of cedar hill the park development fee shall be calculated on the basis of seven hundred dollars $70000 per dwelling unit d in lieu of payment of the required park development fee a developer shall have the option to construct the neighborhood park amenities and improvements all plans and specifications for the construction of such amenities and improvements must be reviewed and approved by the city of cedar hill the developer shall financially guarantee the construction of the amenities and improvements and the city of cedar hill must approve same prior to the filing of a plat in the case of platted subdivisions once the amenities and improvements are constructed and after the city of cedar hill has accepted such amenities and improvements the developer shall deed and convey such amenities and improvements to the city of cedar hill e in instances where land is required to be dedicated the city of cedar hill shall have the right to accept or reject the dedication after consideration of the recommendation of the parks and recreation board or the planning and zoning commission and to require a cash payment in lieu of land in the amount provided under section 2043 hereto if the city of cedar hill determines that sufficient park area is already in the public domain for the area of the proposed development or if the recreation potential for that area would be better served by expanding or improving existing neighborhood parks f when two 2 or more developments will be necessary to create a neighborhood park of sufficient size in the same area the parks and recreation board at the time of preliminary plat approval will work with the developers to define the optimum location of the required dedication within the respective plats once a park site has been determined adjacent property owners who develop around the park site shall dedicate land and cash to the existing site unless otherwise determined by the city council  22200   1 92419 cash in lieu of land a a developer responsible for land dedication under this article shall be required at the city councils option to meet the dedication requirements in whole or in part by a cash payment in lieu of land in the amount set forth below such payment in lieu of land shall be made prior to filing the final plat for record or prior to the issuance of a building permit where a plat is not required the cash payment in lieu of land dedication shall be met by the payment of a fee set from time to time by ordinance of the city council sufficient to acquire neighborhood park land unless and until changed by the city council such fee shall be computed on the basis of five hundred dollars $50000 per dwelling unit a cash payment in lieu of land dedication as set forth in this section does not relieve the developer of its obligation to pay the park development fee set forth in section 2042c above the cash payment in lieu of land dedication is in addition to the required park development fee b the city of cedar hill may from time to time decide to purchase land for parks in or near the area of actual or potential development if the city does purchase park land in a park zone subsequent park land dedications for that zone shall be in cash only the calculation of which is set forth in section 2043a above such cash payment is in addition to the payment of the required park development fee  22200   2 92419 special fund right to refund a all funds collected by this dedication process will be deposited in the city of cedar hills park development fund and used solely for the purchase or leasing of park land and the development of same all expenditures from the said fund will be reviewed and approved by the city council b the city of cedar hill shall account for all sums paid into the park development fund with reference to the individual plats involved any monies paid into the said fund must be expended by the city of cedar hill within ten 10 years from the date received by the city such funds shall be considered to be spent on a first in first out basis in a particular park zone if not so expended within the ten 10 year period the owners of the property will on the last day of such period be entitled to a refund of the remaining fees the current owners of the property within the subdivision must request such a refund within one 1 year of entitlement in writing or such right is waived  22200 prior dedication absence of prior dedication a if a dedication requirement arose prior to the passage of this article that dedication requirement shall be controlled by the ordinance in effect at the time such obligation arose except that additional dedication shall be required if the actual number of dwellings units constructed upon property is greater than the former assumed or planned number of dwelling units additional dedication shall be required only for the increase in the number of dwelling units and shall be based upon the land dedication and park development fee requirements set forth hereinabove b at the discretion of the city any former gift of land to the city may be credited on a per acre basis toward eventual land dedication requirements imposed on the donor of such lands the city council shall consider the recommendations of the parks and recreation board and the planning and zoning commission in exercising its discretion under this subsection  22200 additional requirements definitions a any land dedicated to the city under this article must be suitable for park and recreation uses the following characteristics of a proposed area are generally unsuitable 1 any area primarily located in the 100year flood plain 2 any areas of unusual topography or slope which renders same unusable for organized recreational activities the above characteristics of a park land dedication area may be grounds for refusal of any plat b drainage areas may be accepted as part of a park if the channel is constructed in accordance with city engineering standards if no significant area of the park is cut off from access by such channel if not less than five 5 acres of the site is above the 100year flood plain or if the dedication is in excess of ten 10 acres not less than fifty 50 percent of the site should be included in the 100year flood plain c each park must have ready access to a public street d unless provided otherwise herein an action by the city shall be by the city council after consideration of the recommendations of the parks and recreation board and the planning and zoning commission any proposal considered by the planning and zoning commission under this section shall have been reviewed by the parks and recreation board and

purpose the purpose of a planned development zoning district pd district is to provide for the development of land as an integral unit for single or mixed use in accordance with a pd concept plan that may include uses regulations and other requirements that vary from the provisions of other zoning districts pd districts are intended to implement generally the goals and objectives of the citys comprehensive plan pd districts are also intended to encourage flexible and creative planning to ensure the compatibility of land uses and to allow for the adjustment of changing demands to meet the current needs of the community by meeting one 1 or more of the following purposes a to provide for a superior design of lots or buildings  b to provide for increased recreation andor open space opportunities for public use  c to provide rural amenities or features that would be of special benefit to the property users or community  d to protect or preserve natural amenities and environmental assets such as trees creeks ponds floodplains slopes or hills and viewscapes  e to protect or preserve existing historical buildings structures features or places  or f to provide an appropriate balance between the intensity of development and the ability to provide adequate supporting public facilities and services nature of district and minimum standards each pd district shall be a freestanding zoning district in which land uses and intensities of land use may be tailored to fit the physical features of the site and to achieve compatibility with existing and planned adjacent uses minimum standards for residential and nonresidential uses proposed for the pd district must be incorporated within an ordinance adopted by the council the adopting ordinance in the adopting ordinance the city council may incorporate minimum standards by making reference to a standard zoning district a land use 1 uses unless otherwise provided by the pd ordinance only those uses authorized in section 23 of this chapter are permitted in a pd district 2 location the location of all authorized uses shall be consistent with the pd concept plan and pd site plan 3 residential

nonresidential uses within a pd district a height no structure shall exceed the lower of three 3 stories or fortyfive 45 feet above natural grade b drainage drainage features shall be integrated into the design of the development and shall be contained within ponds and streams with a natural appearance wherever possible c far floor to area ratio shall not exceed onetoone   however the council may authorize higher intensities of use if supported by traffic impact analysis and sitespecific open space analysis b open space standards 1 public and private open space unless otherwise provided by the pd ordinance a minimum of twenty 20 percent of the gross land area within the entire pd district shall be devoted to open space consistent with the open space requirements of the citys comprehensive plan open space for pd districts may be satisfied by either public or by a combination of public and private open space open space requirements specified in this subsection are in addition to requirements for site landscaping and buffering public open space shall be dedicated to the city 2 preservation of natural features unless otherwise provided by the pd ordinance or pd concept plan a

in a form that will assure the city that such open space will be provided the city may require that all open space within the district must be provided prior to completion of development within the district c dimensional and area standards unless otherwise provided by the pd ordinance dimensional and area standards for uses shall be the most restrictive standards authorized by the citys zoning regulations for the same or similar uses plans required there are three 3 types of plans that may be required as part of the development process within a pd district the general purpose and use of each plan is described as follows a pd concept plan the pd concept plan is mandatory and is intended to be used as the first step in the pd development process it establishes the most general guidelines for the pd district by identifying the land uses and intensities thoroughfare locations and open space boundaries including public trail systems it also illustrates the integration of these elements into a master plan for the whole pd district the pd concept plan as incorporated in the pd ordinance and together with the text of the ordinance establishes the development standards for the pd district the pd concept plan shall identify any areas that have different standards than established for the same or similar uses b pd development plan a pd development plan is optional and is intended to be used where necessary as the second step of the pd development process a pd development plan may be used where the developer requests or the council requires certain standards for the pd district to be specified after initial establishment of the pd district and constitutes an amendment to the approved pd concept plan and pd ordinance a pd development plan includes more detailed information as to the specific land uses and their boundaries the purposes of a pd development plan are to allow flexibility in the development process by deferring specification of all development standards at the time of pd district creation and to enable developers to satisfy conditions imposed on creation of the district prior to submittal of a pd site plan c pd site plan a pd site plan is mandatory and is the final step of the pd development process the purposes of a pd site plan are to assure that the development of individual building lots parcels or tracts within the pd district are consistent with the approved concept plan and development plan if any and to assure that the standards applicable within the pd district are met for each such lot parcel or tract if a pd site plan terminates development of the land covered by the terminated plan cannot occur until a new pd site plan has been approved for the land as provided by this section preapplication conference an application for a pd development plan or pd site plan may request a preapplication conference with the planning director prior to formal application the procedures in division 18 shall apply  083005
