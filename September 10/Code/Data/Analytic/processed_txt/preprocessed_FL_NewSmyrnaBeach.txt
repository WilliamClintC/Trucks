10200  enactment and authority this ldr is enacted pursuant to the requirements and authority of fs   the city charter and the general powers in fs ch 166 10300  applicability 10301 general applicability except as specifically provided below the provisions of this ldr shall apply to all development in the city and no development shall be undertaken without prior authorization pursuant to this ldr 10302 exceptions the provisions of this ldr and any amendments thereto shall not affect the validity of any lawfully issued and effective development permit if a a building permit has been issued by the chief building official prior to the effective date of this ordinance  b a site plan or subdivision preliminary or final plat has been approved prior to the effective date of this ordinance 10400  findings 10401 general findings a fs ch 163 requires the city of new smyrna beach to enact unified land development regulations which implements and is consistent with the citys comprehensive plan and which contains all land development regulations for the city b controlling the location design and construction of development within the city is necessary to maintain and improve the quality of life within the city as more fully described below c high quality development pays for itself it provides necessary improvements enhances the tax base attracts other quality development and in general is an asset to the city d low quality development does not pay for itself it overburdens existing improvements adds little to the tax base attracts other low quality development and in general is a liability to the city 10402 specific findings a administration and enforcement 1 land development administrative procedures under one cover promotes efficient development 2 all development proposals should undergo a development review process to assure compliance with the requirements of this ldr 3 mandatory concept review allows developers to modify proposals in response to early citizen and staff comment 4 developments having large potential impact on the environment and community should go more rigorous review process than others 5 review of planning decisions should be independent of review of land development decisions to avoid ad hoc planning on a sitebysite basis 6 all administrative decisions should be supported by a record with written findings to assure accountability and efficient appellate review 7 a quick efficient and nonpolitical avenue of appeal should be available for all administrative decisions 8 enforcement of development orders and the provisions of this ldr should be that are efficient effective and consistent with the ldr enforcement procedures established by state law 9 all developers should develop using the same administration and enforcement procedures 10 development agencies and boards permits and consistent enforcement procedures assure community developments that maintain or improve the quality of life within the city 11 amendment and exception procedures assure quality development in a dynamic and imperfect setting b comprehensive plan consistency and concurrency 1 the citys comprehensive plan is a blueprint of future growth and was developed with input from the community developments consistent with the comprehensive plan express community desires 2 concurrency is required to prevent public facilities from being overloaded and thus reducing the quality of life in the city 3 concurrency will require development to pay for itself and relieve existing residents from the burden of paying for growth c improvement design standards 1 rightofway improvements a are costly to construct and maintain b should provide safe adequate and aesthetically pleasing access to property c contribute greatly to stormwater runoff pollution if drainage systems are not constructed properly d provide a potentially hazardous situation for pedestrian bicycle and vehicular traffic if not properly designed and constructed 2 stormwater management a stormwater runoff erodes land and pollutes ground and surface water b stormwater runoff often contains nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen which adversely affect flora and fauna by accelerating eutrophication of receiving waters c erosion silts up water bodies decreases their capacity to hold and transport water interferes with navigation and damages flora and fauna d installation of impervious surfaces increases the volume and rate of stormwater runoff and decreases groundwater recharge e improperly managed storm water runoff increases the incidence and severity of flooding and endangers property and human life f improperly managed storm water runoff alters the salinity of estuarine areas and diminishes their biological productivity g degradation of ground and surface waters imposes economic costs on the community h eighty to 95 percent of the total annual loading of most stormwater pollutants discharged into receiving waters are concentrated in the flush created by the first one inch of rainfall first flush and carried offsite in the first onehalf inch of runoff i improperly managed storm water adversely affects the drainage of surrounding property 3 utilities a reliance on the city central potable water system reduces salt water intrusion associated with individual wells and package potable water treatment plants  b reliance on the city central sewer system reduces pollution associated with septic tank and package wastewater treatment systems  c underground utilities are much more aesthetically pleasing and cost less to maintain than overhead utilities  and d the utilities commission specifies the required sewer water and electric power capacity for each development 4 fire protection a the amount of water required to extinguish a fire fire flow is indicated in gallons per minute varies with the size of a development  b adequate access to a development must be available in order to provide sufficient fire protection  c firewalls prevent a fire in one unit from easily spreading to another unit  d adequate fire protection saves money for the property owner the city and the residents of the city  and e the ultimate fire protection goal is to prevent loss of life 5  tree preservation and landscaping  tree preservation and landscaping benefit the community by a absorbing carbon dioxide and returning oxygen to the atmosphere  b precipitating dust and other particulates from the air  c providing wildlife habitat particularly for birds which in turn help control insects  d providing soil stabilization which reduces erosion and mitigates the effect of flooding  e providing shade which reduces energy consumption and glare and making outdoor areas more comfortable during the warm months  f making the developed environment more attractive by adding a variety of color shape and pattern and thus increasing community pride and the value of property  g providing attractive buffering between incompatible land uses  h abating noise  i attracting higher quality developments into the community  and j saving money for the property owner and the city in general 6  native vegetation  because native vegetation is adapted to local diseases pests soil and climate it is generally more economical and desirable than exotic species which require more pesticide fertilizer and water 7  exotic vegetation  exotic vegetation can crowd out native vegetation uses more water and damages the environment from increased use of fertilizers and pesticides 8  beneficial trees  because some trees are more beneficial than others the public benefits of tree protection may be obtained without preserving each and every tree 9  mangrove trees  mangrove trees are especially valuable in stabilizing building and protecting the shoreline providing for spawning and breeding grounds for marine organisms and other wildlife and serving as the basis for most of the estuarine food chains which are critical to 70 to 90 percent of those species considered important from a recreational andor commercial standpoint 10 addressing and mail delivery a proper visibility of the property address is necessary for efficient police fire and mail delivery service 11 police protection a proper lighting of property is necessary to prevent vandalism burglary and other mischievous acts  b trees and shrubbery located in front of windows and doors aid criminals in wrongful entry to structures  and c signage can be used in abating crime and traffic violations and improving traffic safety 12 solid waste management a efficient trash collection is necessary for the health and welfare of a community  and b traditionally solid waste management areas are an eye sore aesthetically pleasing solid waste management areas maintain or increase property values and the welfare of the community in general 13 solid waste recycling a solid waste recycling is mandated by state statutes  b solid waste recycling saves money by conserving the valuable natural and manpower resources used to produce goods  and  c solid waste recycling reduces the cost of waste management by reducing dependence on landfill facilities the cost to construct and operate a landfill facility runs in the millions of dollars per acre 14 buildings a buildings constructed to proper standards protect the health of the general public particularly in times of natural or manmade disaster  and b buildings constructed to proper standards maintain or enhance the value of property within the city and therefore enhance the welfare of the general public 15 offstreet parking and loading a some land uses require more parking spaces than other land uses  b the size of automobiles have varied throughout the years during the late 1970s and early 1980s car sizes were generally reduced during the mid and late 1980s car sizes increased inadequate parking space and access aisle size results in damaged automobiles and injured persons  c overpaving a site is unattractive and results in runoff pollution and flooding  and d parking lots need to be designed for vehicular and pedestrian traffic 16 permanent reference points a accurate subdivision of land is necessary to easily determine lot and block boundary lines so there is no question of ownership in the future 17 sidewalk and bicycle facilities a new smyrna beach is a beach and retirement community and thus has a large amount of bicycle and pedestrian traffic b sidewalk and bicycle facilities are needed to assure a safe separation between vehicular bicycle and pedestrian traffic c the city averages approximately one pedestrianvehicular accident per month if more sidewalk and bicycle facilities were available this rate would most likely be lower d the city may be held liable in a pedestrian or bicycleautomobile accident for not providing adequate pedestrian or bicycle facilities 18 signs a the manner of the erection location and maintenance of signs affects the public health safety morals and welfare of the people of this community b the safety of motorists cyclists pedestrians other users of the public streets and property is affected by the number size location and appearance of signs that are intended to and result in the diversion of the attention of drivers c the size and location of signs may if uncontrolled constitute an obstacle to effective firefighting techniques d the construction erection and maintenance of large signs suspended from or placed on the tops of buildings walls or other structures may constitute a direct danger to pedestrian and vehicular traffic below especially during periods of strong winds e uncontrolled and unlimited signs may degrade the aesthetic attractiveness of the natural and manmade attributes of the community and thereby undermine the economic value of tourism visitation and permanent economic growth f it is therefore necessary for the promotion and preservation of the public health safety and welfare of the people of this community that the erection construction location and maintenance of signs be regulated and controlled g large signs flashing signs or other signs specifically prohibited are prohibited because they distract traffic and thus create unsafe conditions for the general public d subdivision design 1 aesthetically pleasing subdivision design attracts potential residents and thus increases the sale of lots and tax base  2 adequate dimensions orientation and access are desirable and attractive to potential residents  and 3 subdivisions with adequate access are convenient and attractive to potential residents and safe in case of an emergency e flood zones 1 flooding is a natural recurring phenomenon in the city 2 naturally floodprone lands serve the following important functions in the regional hydrologic cycle and ecological system because they a provide natural storage and conveyance of floodwaters  b facilitate groundwater recharge  c provide temporary storage of surface waters that moderates flood elevations and the timing velocity and rate of flood discharges  d reduce erosion and filter nutrients sediments and other pollutants from floodwaters  and e export detritus and other food sources to open water bodies and are vital habitat for fish birds wildlife and native plant communities 3 naturally occurring flooding may provide recharge to groundwaters and a basic source of flow to surface waters 4 the uncontrolled development of floodprone lands substantially degrades the health safety and welfare of the community in the following ways a the owners residents customers guests and employees occupying homes businesses and other structures located in floodprone areas are placed at unreasonable risk of personal injury and property damage  b expensive and dangerous search rescue and disaster relief operations may be necessary when developed properties are flooded  c roads public facilities and utilities associated with development may be damaged by flooding at great expense to taxpayers and rate payers  d flooding of developed properties may lead to demands that the government construct expensive and environmentally damaging projects to control floodwaters  e normally floodfree lands are placed at risk of flooding when floodwaters on natural floodprone areas are obstructed diverted displaced or channelized by development  f water quality is degraded the supply of freshwater to estuaries is disrupted and habitat is lost  and g property values are lowered and economic activity is disrupted by damaging floods f protection of environmentally sensitive lands 1 protection of environmentally sensitive lands promotes the well being of the people of the city as described below and in the conservation element 2 the various types of protected environmentally sensitive areas serve the following beneficial functions a wetlands provide natural storage and conveyance of floodwaters and minimize erosion and sedimentation by reducing flood flows and the velocity of floodwaters  b coastal wetlands and inland wetlands adjoining larger lakes and rivers protect wildlife and the shoreline from destructive wave action  c wetlands filter and help decompose sediments nutrients and other natural and manmade pollutants that would otherwise degrade surface and ground waters  d wetlands support commercial and recreational fishing because they provide essential nutrients and hatcheries for aquatic life  e wetlands provide habitat for rare and endangered species and provide essential breeding and protective habitats for many other birds mammals and reptiles  and f wetlands supply ground and surface water 3 agricultural and development activities have

of cross section urban or rural  locally available data from recent projects on acquisition drainage and utility costs  and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events c if the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the developer then the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section d if the city accepts any rightofway dedication for the proportionate fairshare payment credit for the dedication of the nonsite related rightofway shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 120 percent of the most recent assessed value of the land upon which the rightofway is or will be located by the volusia county property appraiser or at the mutual agreement of the city and the developer by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city the developer shall supply a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city if the estimated value of the rightofway dedication proposed by the developer is less than the city estimated total proportionate fairshare obligation for that development then the developer must also pay the difference e proportionate fairshare mitigation shall be applied as a credit against impact fees credits will be given for that portion of the impact fees that would have been used to fund the improvements on which the proportionate fairshare contribution is calculated additionally if the proportionate fairshare contribution is based on only a portion of the developments traffic the credit will be limited to that portion of the impact fees on which the proportionate fairshare contribution is based f at the time the proportionate fairshare obligation is being determined the city will also compute the transportation facilities impact fee obligation for the proposed development if the developers proportionate fairshare obligation is less than the developments anticipated total transportation facilities impact fee then the developer must pay the difference to the city 6 should the developer fail to apply for a building permit within two years of the date of execution of the proportionate fairshare agreement then the agreement shall be considered null and void and the developer shall be required to reapply in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter 7 payment of the proportionate fairshare contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be nonrefundable if the payment is submitted more than one year from the date of execution of the agreement then the proportionate fairshare cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment pursuant to section 40201c5a and adjusted accordingly 8 developer improvements authorized under this subchapter involving dedications to the city must be completed upon final acceptance of the improvements and receipt of a warranty bond the city attorney shall approve the form of the warranty bond 9 developer improvements authorized under this subchapter not involving dedications to the city must be completed upon recording of a final plat or upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy whichever event first occurs 10 any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order will be subject to additional proportionate fairshare contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic 11 a developer may submit a letter to withdraw the proportionate fairshare agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement the application fee to the city will be nonrefundable 12 all proportionate fairshare revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the cip or for use as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fairshare agreement 13 in the event a scheduled transportation facility improvement is removed from the cip then the revenues collected for its construction shall be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridor that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of section 40201c2b as determined by the

properties in the activity center as shown on the citys comprehensive plan future land use map and  us1 from art center avenue to the northern city boundary line 2 purpose and intent the purpose of this section is to establish regulations to ensure safe ingress to and egress from proposed development along arterial transportation corridors by a reducing the number of indiscriminate driveways  b maintaining the integrity of the corridor by assuring that traffic generation is consistent with the corridors designed capacity  c lessening the possibility of hazardous traffic conditions and traffic congestion  and d establishing development standards including additional buffer and landscaping regulations that will preserve and enhance the natural character of the corridor which serves as a gateway into the city e screen parked vehicles from view of the traveling public as commercial development expands along arterial transportation corridors conflicts result between the corridors function and its ability to move high volumes of traffic area this congestion is intensified where commercial growth is permitted adjacent to the corridor disproportionate to the corridors designed limitations 3 applicability the increased commercial growth that has occurred along these gateway corridors in recent years has started changing the character of the corridors what were once treelined corridors have gradually and often rapidly begun to exhibit characteristics of uncontrolled strip commercial development once this pattern is established it is difficult to encourage alternative types of development eg residential along these corridors therefore these regulations apply to the arterial corridors listed above which a move large volumes of in addition to significant volumes of everyday local traffic and b do not contain significant amounts of strip commercial development these arterial corridor regulations are intended to supplement the applicable regulations of the

of the people of the city posed by permitting an establishment at which the activities described in subsections a b and c of this section occur to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate n requiring operators of establishments at which the activities described in subsections 1 2 and 3 of this section occur to keep records of information concerning workers and certain recent past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by making it difficult for minors to work in such establishments o prohibiting establishments at which the activities described in subsections a b and c of this section occur from operating within set distances of educational institutions religious institutions residences areas zoned or designated for residential use and parks at which minors are customarily found will serve to protect minors from the adverse effects of the activities that accompany such establishments p straddle dancing unregulated private

transmittable diseases r the practice of not paying workers at sexually oriented businesses and requiring them to earn their entire income from tips or gratuities from their customers who are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in an extremely high nearly universal incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers s sexually oriented businesses involve activities the sole purpose of which is financial gain rather than free speech or expressive activity and therefore are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health welfare and safety of the community t requiring sexually oriented businesses to post a listing of services provided to restrict services to those listed and to maintain a customer contract and transaction record in a daily register will discourage incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution thereby further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal acts do occur  3172005 91000  construction this be liberally construed to accomplish its purpose of licensing regulating and dispersing
