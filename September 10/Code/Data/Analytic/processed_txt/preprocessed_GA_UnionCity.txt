restricted a based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities including but not limited to atlanta and fulton county georgia  dekalb county georgia  smyrna georgia  and richmond county georgia  which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems faced by union city we take note of the notorious and selfevident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality which do not vary greatly among general comparable communities within our country moreover it is the finding of this council that public nudity either partial or total under certain circumstances particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in socalled nude bars or establishments offering socalled nude entertainment or adult entertainment begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct prostitution and drug trafficking and use among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas therefore the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow andor encourage nudity to that end this section is hereby adopted b the following types of entertainment attire and conduct are prohibited upon any premises licensed to

municipalities including but not limited to atlanta and fulton county georgia  dekalb county georgia  smyrna georgia  and richmond county georgia  which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems faced by union city we take note of the notorious and selfevident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality which do not vary greatly among general comparable communities within our country moreover it is the finding of this council that public nudity either partial or total under certain circumstances particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in socalled nude bars or establishments offering socalled nude entertainment or adult entertainment begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct prostitution and drug trafficking and use among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas therefore the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow andor encourage nudity to that

to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city of union city hereinafter the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city the provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent nor the effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor the effect of this ordinance to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material b based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the mayor and council and on studies in other communities including but not limited to the analysis of the relationships between adult entertainment establishments crime and housing values performed by the minnesota crime prevention center inc october 1980  the experience of the cities of college park forest park marietta and smyrna the mayor and council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises the commercial exploitation of human sexuality in all forms in which such exploitation may be manifested has a deleterious effect on the community where it takes place as heretofore mentioned and that such effects are intensified and exacerbated when such is provided in conjunction with the service or consumption of alcohol sexually oriented businesses cause an increase in criminal behavior in nearby areas including but not limited to disorderly conduct prostitution solicitation drug trafficking drug use and corruption of public officials 2 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 3 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions further such establishments escalate undesirable community conditions including blight diminished property values and cause increases in the need for law enforcement and emergency medical response resources and increases in the burden on the judicial system as a result of the criminal behavior which the mayor and council finds such business establishments bring to a community the negative effects such businesses cause are not limited to such facilities that offer live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts but that other forms of sexually oriented businesses also have deleterious effect on nearby neighborhoods commercial districts and on urban life in general these other types of such businesses include but are not limited to adult bookstores peep shows massage parlors bathhouses adult gift and novelty shops and lingerie or nude modeling studios 4 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug use exposure to infected blood and blood components 5 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 6 the findings noted in paragraphs 1 5 raise substantial governmental concerns sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 7 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 8 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult entertainment establishments 9 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 10 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 11 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted

1 the mayor and council finds that sex acts for hire are inherently exploitative endanger the health safety and welfare of the participants and citizens in general affect property values and are an affront to the dignity of our citizens these exploitative acts adversely affect a property or area in which they occur and lead to the avoidance of such places by lawabiding citizens increased opportunity for unlawful criminal activities and further decay of neighborhoods 2 the city has a strong interest i in ensuring that citizens feel safe in their neighborhoods  ii in protecting the health of its citizens  iii in safeguarding the economic vitality of its business districts  and iv in preserving peace and order in public places to enable them to be used for their intended purpose 3 the mayor and council find that loitering for the purpose of procuring others to engage in sex acts for hire usually includes a power imbalance between those seeking to purchase the sexual services and those being exploited to perform the sex acts with the persons procuring the sexual services tending to be more economically and socially advantaged than the people who would provide the sex acts a person seeking to purchase the sexual services bears a greater responsibility for the transaction than does the person being prostituted furthermore it is widely acknowledged by criminal justice experts that holding purchasers or johns principally accountable for these sex acts for hire is the most effective method available to reduce the incidence of prostitution in an area 4 this section is

union city stormwater utility   61912 general provisions a purpose and intent the purpose of this article is to protect the public health safety environment and general welfare establishment of a stormwater utility in the city of union city the objectives of this article are stated as follows 1 the professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and submitted to the mayor and council properly assess and define the stormwater management problems needs goals program priorities and funding opportunities of the city 2 given the problems needs goals program priorities and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the city it is appropriate to authorize the establishment of a separate accounting unit which shall be dedicated specifically to the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater systems in the city 3 stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city intense urban development in the city has radically altered the natural hydrology of the area and the hydraulics of stormwater systems with many natural elements having been replaced or augmented by manmade facilities as a result the specific service system and facility demands in the city now exceed the service capability of many of the systems an advanced level of service is needed in the city due to its urbanization therefore a stormwater utility service area subject to stormwater service charges should encompass the entirety of the city to enable the city to successfully manage operate and improve stormwater systems at an advanced level 4 it is most equitable that a portion of the needed stormwater service level continue to be funded from the citys general tax revenues and therefore that the mayor and council may allocate general fund support to stormwater management in the future in the form of a combination of service charge payments for cityowned properties and a supplemental allocation of general fund funding 5 the stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protecting the public health safety and welfare funding of stormwater services and facilities is therefore incidental to the fundamental regulatory function of the city in protecting the public health safety and welfare 6 provision of stormwater management programs systems and facilities renders andor results in both service and benefit to individual properties property owners citizens and residents of the city and to all properties property owners citizens and residents of the city concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses and the service and benefits differ among the individual properties property owners citizens and residents in relation to the demands they impose individually and collectively on the stormwater systems 7 the service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management programs systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater programs systems and facilities and risk exposure it is not practical to allocate the cost of the citys stormwater management programs systems and facilities in direct relationship to the services or benefits rendered to or received by individual properties or persons over a brief span of time but it is both practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among properties and persons in proportion to the longterm demands they impose on the citys stormwater programs systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits 8 the city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed installed and acquired mechanisms over many years the future usefulness and value of the

vii  stormwater utility rates short title this article will be known as the union city stormwater utility rates   61912 general provisions a purpose and intent the purpose of this article is to protect the public health safety environment and general welfare establishment of stormwater utility rates in the city of union city the objectives of this article are stated as follows 1 the professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and considered to the mayor and council properly assess define and project the cost of stormwater management systems and facilities of the city 2 given the projected cost of stormwater management programs systems and facilities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the city it is appropriate to adopt a stormwater service fee rate methodology and to charge service fees to properties and persons within the city in a manner that recovers the cost of programs systems and facilities and other costs associated therewith including but not limited to allocations of the cost of services provided to the stormwater management utility by other funds of the city and other government entities and agencies interest on bonds operational and emergency reserves allowances for delinquencies and bad debt and such other costs as may be deemed reasonable and appropriate by the mayor and council of the city to ensure the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater programs systems and facilities in the city 3 stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city and the stormwater service fee rate methodology and service fees should be applicable throughout the city to enable the city to successfully manage operate and improve stormwater programs systems and facilities at an advanced level 4 it is most equitable that a portion of the needed stormwater service level continue to be funded from the citys general tax revenues and therefore that the mayor and council may allocate general fund support to stormwater management in the future in the form of a combination of service charge payments for cityowned properties and a supplemental allocation of general fund funding 5 the stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protecting the public health safety and welfare funding of stormwater services and facilities is therefore incidental to the fundamental regulatory function of the city in protecting the public health safety and welfare 6 provision of stormwater management programs systems and facilities renders andor results in both service and benefit to individual properties property owners citizens and residents of the city and to all properties property owners citizens and residents of the city concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses and the service and benefits differ among the individual properties property owners citizens and residents in relation to the demands they impose individually and collectively on the stormwater systems 7 the service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management programs systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater programs systems and facilities and risk exposure it is not practical to allocate the cost of the citys stormwater management programs systems and facilities in direct relationship to the services or benefits rendered to or received by individual properties or persons over a brief span of time but it is both practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among properties and persons in proportion to the longterm demands they impose on the citys stormwater programs systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits 8 the city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed installed and acquired mechanisms over many years the future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater systems and facilities owned and operated by the city and of future additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance

introduction as the use and character of land changes due to the growth of union city it is important to recognize the adverse effects those changes can have on natural and manmade systems applying reasonable solutions project by project is much easier and more cost effective than ignoring negative impacts until they become monumental problems drainage affords an excellent example of this point up until the early 1970s urban growth was accomplished without consideration that storm water runoff and soil erosion were dramatically increased by development the result of this approach was often heavy siltation and flooding even though modern detention and erosion control regulations have eased the problems many cities still suffer drainage woes stemming from years of poor storm water management the purpose of this manual is to establish criteria for dealing with drainage for all projects within the city of union city set forth herein are policies methods and techniques to be used in developing drainage improvements on a consistent basis throughout the city it must be recognized that this manual is not intended to be a complete reference on drainage nor is it expected to cover every situation which may arise the manual is to serve as a guide to engineers versed in drainage analysis and design unique circumstances requiring special or alternative design methods should be brought to the attention of the city early in project life so that agreement on problem approach can be reached without impacting project progress manual users are encouraged to comment on its contents so that it may be made as useful and applicable as possible chapter 1 design policy hydrology for drainage areas containing 50 acres or less designs are to be based on the rational method designs for areas containing more than 50 acres are to be based on a method approved by the city engineer for the specific basin normally the soil conservation service method or the usgs flood frequency relation method may be used within the city of union city georgia the burkliziegler formula and the talbot formula are not considered appropriate culverts and piped systems 1 culverts are to be designed for a 50 year frequency flood event the area inundated by the design event is to be contained in a drainage easement 2 piped storm drainage systems are to be designed for a 25 year frequency storm event in nonresidential areas and for a 10 year frequency storm event in residential areas catch basins are to be spaced so that the maximum gutter spread is six feet or less for the design storm event 3 the minimum pipe size to be used as a culvert or in a piped system is 15 inch diameter 4 under city streets all pipe used for culverts and storm drainage systems is to be reinforced concrete corrugated plastic pipe may also be used for culverts and storm drainage systems not under city streets pipe class for reinforced concrete is to be determined for actual conditions anticipated for each specific application but not less than class iii the designer may select round pipe conforming to astm c76 arch pipe conforming to astm c506 or elliptical pipe conforming to astm c507 5 for concrete culvert and pipe systems a roughness coefficient mannings n of  is to be used for corrugated plastic culvert and pipe systems a roughness coefficient mannings n of  is to be used 6 the minimum velocity in a pipe flowing full is to be 20 feet per second the maximum velocity in a pipe flowing full is to be 120 feet per second the exit velocity of culvert and pipe systems is to be controlled and modified to prevent channel erosion or scour 7 the absolute minimum clearance between the bottom of the paving base or subbase and the exterior crown of the storm drain pipe or culvert is to be 10 foot a clearance of 20 feet is considered more desirable and should be achieved if possible detention facilities 1 detention facilities are required for any project when the runoff is increased by more than 10 cubic foot per second for a 10 year frequency storm event 2 the peak release rate of storm water from a project is not to be increased from the pre developed state for all intensities up to and including the 100 year event specific storm events to be examined include the 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 year return frequency 3 detention facilities located on paved areas used for parking or vehicular access are discouraged the depth of water in a detention facility located on paved areas also used for vehicular purposes is limited to six inches the depth of water in a detention facility located on paved areas also used for parking is limited to two inches chapter 2 data collection drainage basin size the size of drainage basins for a project is to be determined from 1 field survey using conventional topographic techniques 2 aerial topographic maps of the project 3 aerial topographic maps available county 4 other maps acceptable to the city land use in drainage basins having limits beyond the boundaries of a project land use outside the project will be considered as either 1 the existing development or 2 natural undeveloped as appropriate soil conditions the soil conditions for a project are to be determined from 1 field survey of project site soils 2 soil survey of fulton county georgia u s department of agriculture soil conservation service existing storm drains careful field investigation is required to locate existing storm drains which drain into or are located within a project data on pipe or culvert material size slope entrance and exit conditions should be recorded any construction record information on existing storm drains will be made available at city hall public works department this data must be field verified as the city cannot assure correctness or accuracy of record information chapter 3 rational method rational method formula the rational method provides a means to relate rainfall to storm water runoff the formula expressed below gives peak runoff in cubic feet per second from a drainage basin q   cia q   the peak runoff in cubic feet per second c   a coefficient representing the ratio of runoff to rainfall i   the average rainfall intensity in inches per hour for a duration equal to the time of concentration tc a   the drainage area in acres runoff coefficient the selection of a runoff coefficient c is judgmental to choose a realistic valve the engineer must consider soil type and moisture content topography land use and imperviousness of the drainage area table 31 presents typical values which are characteristic of the fairburn palmetto union city area time of concentration the time of concentration tc is the time in minutes required for runoff to flow from the most hydraulically remote point in the drainage area to the point under investigation it is taken as the sum of the inlet time and the travel time inlet time is the time storm water is flowing overland to the nearest pipe channel or natural waterway figure 32 taken from the usda is to be used to establish overland flow velocities for calculating inlet time table 31 runoff coefficients for various

detention requirements for small drainage areas of 3 acres or less the bowstring method may be used by this method storage required is equal to the maximum difference between the total inflow based on post development conditions less the total outflow based on natural undevelopment conditions example no 2 at the end of this chapter illustrates the bowstring method the designer may also use the reservoir routing method drainage areas over 3 acres for drainage areas over 3 acres in size the reservoir routing method is to be used to establish detention requirements the basic technique of this method calls for repetitive solution to the continuity equation the formula of the equation utilized is i1 + i2 + 2s1  01   2s2 + 02 t t where t   a selected time interval i1   inflow at the start of the time interval o1   outflow at the start of the time interval s1   storage at the start of the time interval i2   inflow at the end of the time interval o2   outflow at the end of the time interval s2   storage at the end of the time interval the inflow hydrograph for the reservoir routing metered is to be developed from the appropriate unit hydrograph on figure 41 the reservoir routing method is illustrated by example no 3 at the end of this chapter design storms in determining detention design the engineer must evaluate the 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 year return frequency storm events under all events analyzed the peak natural undeveloped runoff is not to be exceeded in determining the peak natural undeveloped runoff a runoff coefficient c not exceeding 03 must be used unless a higher coefficient can be demonstrated by fact all such higher values must have the written concurrence of the city engineer emergency overflow detention facilities should be suitable for storing excessive post development runoff for all storm events year frequency because however the 100 year event can be exceeded and because outlet works can become partially or totally blocked the design engineer must provide an emergency overflow for all detention facilities the emergency overflow should direct flows to minimize property damage and avoid risk to people freeboard detention facilities for sites of 2 acres or less should have a freeboard of not less than six inches for sites exceeding 2 acres the freeboard should be not less than one foot freeboard is defined as the difference between the detention facility water surface elevation for the 100 year frequency storm event and the lowest elevation of the detention basin excluding the emergency overflow example no 2 design the detention

80 min which is less than allowable release rate of 1217 cfs the proposed design is therefore acceptable note at this point engineer can 1 proceed to verify other frequency storm events or 2 refine design to get maximum release rate closer to allowable release rate chapter 5 open channels design improved open channels used as a part of a storm drainage system should be sized to accommodate flows for the storm events given in of this manual flow velocities and depths should be determined from the manning equation a channel system consist of its 1 cross section configuration 2 horizontal alignment 3 slope or grade and 4 surface materials these components must be combined so that the resulting system prevents erosion the actual selection of system components is left to the design engineer the minimum channel conditions the design engineer must achieve are 1 not less than an established grass lining and 2 a lined freeboard of at least 6 inches above the 10 year frequency storm flow manning n for channel calculations select the appropriate roughness coefficient from the chart at the end of this chapter the chart was taken from the georgia department of transportation manual on drainage design for highways allowable velocities the maximum permissible velocities in channels lined with uniform stands of various grass covers are not to exceed the values given in the table on the following page this table is from the manual for erosion and sediment control in georgia chapter 6 culverts design the design of culverts in union city is to be based on chapters 6 and 7 of the georgia department of transportation manual on drainage design for highways plan data construction plans for culverts presented to the city for review should contain at least the following data for each culvert 1 drainage area 2 design discharge and flood frequency 3 water surface elevation at design discharge 4 culvert size and slope chapter 7 storm drains inlet spacing catchbasins drop inlets and similar structures for removing storm runoff from streets are to be spaced as necessary to keep gutter spread at or less than the maximum value identified in the procedure and design aid charts contained in of the georgia department of transportation manual on drainage design for highway is an acceptable method for use in the city of union city piped systems piped storm drain systems should be designed using the manning equation chapter 8 sediment and erosion control the control of sedimentation and erosion is an important element in the construction process measures must be taken to assure that soil from construction and land clearing sites does not pollute waterways to accomplish this goal the manual for erosion and sediment control in georgia by the state soil & water
