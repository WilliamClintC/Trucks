resources other than those listed above including but not limited to parking facilities viewing platforms and blufftop parks 5 character of accessway use a pass and repass refers to the right of the public to walk and run along an accessway because this use limitation can substantially restrict the publics ability to enjoy adjacent publicly owned tidelands by restricting the potential use of lateral accessways it will be applied only in connection with vertical access or other types of access where the findings required by subsections o and r of this section establish that the limitation is necessary to protect natural habitat values topographic features such as eroding bluffs or privacy of the landowner b passive recreational use refers to the right of the public to conduct activities normally associated with beach use such as walking swimming jogging sunbathing fishing surfing picnicking but not including organized sports campfires or vehicular access other than for emergencies or maintenance c active recreational use refers to the right of the public to conduct the full range of beachoriented activities not including horseback riding and use of motorized vehicles unless specifically authorized c access required as a condition of approval and prior to issuance of a permit or other authorization for any new development identified in paragraphs 1 of this

identified in subsections e of this section shall be required and shall be supported by findings required by subsections o of this section  provided that no such condition of approval for coastal access shall be imposed if the analysis required by paragraphs o1 and 2 establishes that the development will not adversely affect either individually or cumulatively the ability of the public to reach and use public tidelands and coastal resources or that the access dedication requirement will not alleviate the access burdens identified or is not reasonably related to those burdens in both nature and extent 1 new development on any parcel or location where public access is identified in the land use plan as desirable 2 new development between the nearest public roadway and the sea 3 new

general welfare and quality of life by regulating the location height and physical characteristics and provide for orderly and efficient placement of wireless communication facilities in the city of huntington beach because of the potential negative aesthetic impacts of wireless communication facilities including visual blight and diminution of property value the city endeavors to locate antennas within commercial industrial and other nonresidential zones screen them from view and encourage colocation with other wireless communication facilities however the federal telecommunications act specifically 47 usc c7 preempts local zoning where a wireless facility is necessary to remedy a significant gap in the wireless providers service consequently where the city determines that the facility does not satisfy city planning and zoning standards the wireless provider may then choose to establish federal preemption because i a significant gap in wireless coverage exists and ii there is a lack of feasible alternative site locations a myriad of factors are involved in determining if a gap is significant such as whether the gap affects a commuter highway  the nature and character of the area and the number of potential users affected by the alleged lack of service  whether the signal is weak or nonexistent and whether the gap affects a commercial district consequently the city will require scientific evidence from an expert in the field demonstrating the existence of a significant gap in service and a lack of feasible alternative sites the applicant will be required to pay for the cost of said expert opinion b definitions for the purpose of this section the following definitions for the following terms shall apply 1 accessory structure any structure or equipment that is
