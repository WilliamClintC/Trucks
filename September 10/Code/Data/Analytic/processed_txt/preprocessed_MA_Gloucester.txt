resource areas identified in section 1211b is significant to one or more of the interests identified in section 12103 2 these presumptions are rebuttable ie the presumption may be overcome based on a clear showing by credible evidence that the activity in the resource area does not play a role in protection of said interests 3 in making its determination as to a resource area the commission will employ the standards and presumptions contained in parts ii and iii of 310 cmr 1000 wetlands protection with the following amplifications a where a proposed activity involves the removing filling dredging or altering of any marsh swamp bog or wet meadow the commission will presume that the areas are significant to the same interests as bordering vegetative wetlands which are specified in 310 cmr 10551 b where a proposed activity involves the removing filling dredging or altering of the upland edge of an acec the commission will presume that such area is significant to the following interests flood control  prevention of storm damage  protection of land containing shellfish and fisheries  wildlife habitat  and prevention of pollution b performance standards 1 when the commission allows work to be performed in an area that it has determined to be significant to the protection of the interests identified in section 12103 it will require the work to meet certain performance standards performance standards are intended to identify the standard of care to which the applicant must adhere in order to achieve the protection of the affected interests 2 performance standards vary according to the resource area affected the commission will employ the performance standards contained in parts ii and iii of 310 cmr 1000 of the act with the following amplifications a where a proposed activity involves the removing filling dredging or altering of any marsh swamp bog or wet meadow the commission will employ the performance standards which apply to bordering vegetative

vegetation other than exiting lawns flowers vegetables crops and ornamental shrubs shall be cut within the upland edge 2 no impervious surface shall be added to land within the upland edge impervious surfaces include but may not be limited to roads and driveways as well as structures 3 no components of any drainage system or septic system shall be installed within 100 feet of the upland edge  that

of the acec andor the upland edge andor the buffer zone for any upgrade to or replacement of an existing septic system required by the board of health when the applicant can show that there is no reasonable alternative location on the lot for the proposed activity and that any adverse impacts will be minimized d notwithstanding the provisions of subsection b2b2 and b3 of this section the commission may issue a wetlands permit permitting such work which results in the loss or alteration of a portion of the upland edge or buffer zone for any of the following 1 existence prior to adoption of subdivision control in the city in 1961  2 already approved under subdivision control law or protected under law from zoning changes because of the subdivision process  and 3 by planning board in accordance with anr procedures of mgl c 41  81p or plans for lots submitted to the planning board prior to the adoption of this article when the applicant can show that there is no reasonable alternative location on the lot for the proposed activity and that any adverse impacts will be minimized notwithstanding these performance standards it shall be noted that resource areas such as a coastal bank land under a body of water stream or pond or bordering vegetated wetland or marsh bog or swamp may be contained within the upland edge when this occurs on any given parcel the more restrictive standards shall apply a showing that the proposed activity will be limited to reconstruction within the same footprint of a building existing as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived will be sufficient to overcome this presumption 3 the performance standards contained in subsection b2 of this section are minimum standards where these standards are not sufficient in the commissions judgment to protect the interests identified in section 12103 of this article the commission may impose such conditions as are necessary to provide the indicated level of protection see section 1220a c burden of proof 1 any person who files a notice of intent to perform any work within the resource area or within the buffer zone has the burden of demonstrating to the

forth in mgl c 83  10 b purpose  this section is designed to serve the following purposes 1 to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the city sewer system 2 to limit the number of sewer extensions in ward 52 in an effort to conserve citywide resources pertaining to sewage treatment 3 to provide for orderly growth in ward 52 4 to delineate areas intended for service by fixedline sewers versus those areas intended for service by onsite wastewater treatment 5 to depict where the city may consider authorizing funding for sewer construction and to depict where private parties may fund the cost for sewer construction c statement of legislative intent  in 1989 the city was required by state and federal government consent decree usa and commonwealth of massachusetts v city of gloucester no 8922067y to deal with contamination emanating from sanitary system emissions the decree included local action to restore and maintain coastal water quality including formulation of a wastewater management plan board of health 1994 which provides strategies to identify and replace substandard septic systems in seven parts of the city with known coastal water pollution problems the wastewater management plan was developed just as the commonwealth updated onsite wastewater regulations known as title 5 and it provides a framework to ensure that all septic systems are properly maintained on  standards articulated in this plan were adopted as onsite wastewater regulations regulation #6 by the board of health more recently the town of essex was ordered to resolve long standing similar issues of failing septic systems and pollution the result was that an intermunicipal agreement was instituted providing that essex would tie into gloucesters sewer system after it finances construction of a main sewer line along essex avenue in gloucester with the impending construction of a sewer to essex it became a priority to address development potential within the essex avenue corridor and on adjacent streets because the area is completely unsewered and has large tracts of undeveloped land the west gloucester land use and wastewater plan ward 52 section  final report by daylor consulting group was a byproduct of public process that explores how to solve existing water quality and wastewater disposal problems in the 52 precinct while at the same time planning proactively for future physical development of the area this study 1 assesses water pollution associated with failing septic systems in the 52 precinct  2 identifies areas where onsite wastewater solutions are most feasible andor cost effective  3 identifies areas where sanitary sewer connections are most feasible or cost effective  and 4 places every property either in or out of one of two defined sewer service areas within which it is permissible for a user to dispose wastewater into the sanitary sewer system this sewer extension ordinance does not necessarily authorize or mandate construction of sewers by the city but rather it enables or makes it permissible to develop sewers within certain eligible sewer service areas and it is intended to promote consistency with recommendations of the west gloucester land use and wastewater plan ward 52 section and the community development plan for the city of gloucester 2001 by providing a mechanism to facilitate orderly development of sewers inside the aforementioned sewer service areas to promote sitings of onsite wastewater systems outside of these areas and to establish a procedure whereby city council may amend these sewer service area boundaries public process a separate city ordinance and corresponding dpw sewer rules and regulations provide for application and review of a permit application to actually
