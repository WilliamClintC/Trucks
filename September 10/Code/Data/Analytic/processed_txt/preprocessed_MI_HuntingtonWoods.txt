wireless communications facilities wcfs purpose wireless communication technologies are changing the way information is exchanged in our everyday lives to access this wireless technology a network of antennas must be strategically placed within and outside of the community the purpose of the following regulations is to encourage and promote wireless communications coverage for all areas of the city while retaining the integrity of its neighborhoods and the character property values and aesthetic quality of the community as a whole to that end the goals of this article are 1 to permit wireless communications facilities wcfs on certain public properties and street rightsofway within the city  2 to protect residential districts and land uses from the potential adverse impact of wcfs  3 to strongly encourage the joint use of existing wcf sites buildings or towers rather than the construction of new wcfs  4 to minimize the total number of wcfs throughout the community  5 to consider the public health safety and welfare of the community  6 to provide for the disclosure of adequate information about plans for wcfs in order to allow the city to effectively plan for the location of such facilities  7 to avoid potential damage to adjacent and nearby properties from wcf failure careful siting of towers  and 8 to encourage configuration of wcfs in a way that minimizes the negative visual impact of towers and antennas on neighborhoods community landmarks historical sites and buildings natural beauty areas and cultural landscapes design siting landscaping and innovative camouflaging techniques this includes consideration of alternative technologies that do not require the use of towers and the avoidance of unsightly structures such as lattice towers outofscale imitation trees and flag poles in furtherance of these goals the city shall give due consideration to the citys master plan zoning ordinance and map existing land uses and the environment  8212012 reservation of rights to require franchise the city is not at this time requiring a franchise for the siting of a wireless communications facility wcf within the citys boundaries the city reserves the
