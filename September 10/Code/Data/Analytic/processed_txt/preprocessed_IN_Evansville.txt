test athe application for a private sewage disposal permit shall be made by a master plumber who is duly registered in the city in addition it shall be made on a form provided by the health department which shall be supplemented by any plans specifications and other information deemed necessary by the health officer bbefore the application can be received by the health officer it will be necessary to have a soil percolation test conducted on the ground which will be used by the private sewage disposal device this includes both the surface of the ground and the ground below the surface to the depth of the proposed system the soil percolation method to be employed is outlined in detail in subsection c of this section should the contour of the original ground be changed in depth to a degree that would render the original percolation test useless it will then be mandatory to obtain another percolation test on the changed ground and with this new percolation result determine the size of the system necessary retesting of the same areas of lots which have failed the original percolation test will be at a frequency of not less than threemonth intervals cthe absorbing ability of the soil is estimated by performing a percolation test on the soil in the area to be used all of the design factors are correlated and presented in table i below which may be used to determine the total horizontal area to be provided in the bottom of the distribution trenches a percolation test shall be done as follows 1two tests shall be made in separate test holes spaced uniformly over the proposed

be bored with a sixinch diameter posthole auger 3roughen or scratch the bottom and sides of the holes to provide a natural surface remove all loose material from the hole place about two inches of coarse sand or fine gravel in the hole to prevent bottom scouring 4fill the hole with clear water to a minimum depth of 12 inches over the gravel by refilling if necessary or by supplying a surplus reservoir of water with an automatic siphon keep water in the hole for at least four hours and preferably overnight in sandy soils containing little or no clay this saturation procedure is not necessary and the test can be made after the water from one filling has seeped away see subsection c5c of this section 5percolation rate measurements should be made on the day following the saturation process except in sandy soils aif water remains in the test hole after the saturation period adjust the depth to six inches over the gravel from a fixed reference point measure the drop in water level over a 60minute period bif no water remains in the hole after the saturation period add clear water to a depth of about six inches over the gravel from a fixed reference point measure the height of the water surface at approximately 60minute intervals over a fourhour period refilling the hole to a depth of six inches as necessary the drop which occurs during the final 60minute period is used to calculate the percolation rate cin sandy soils or other soils in which the first six inches of water seep away in less than 60 minutes after saturation period the time interval between measurements can be taken at 30 minutes and the test run over a period of one hour the drop which occurs in the final 30minute period is used to calculate the percolation rate table i absorption area required
