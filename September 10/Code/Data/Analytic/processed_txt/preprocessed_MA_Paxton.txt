plan he wishes to pursue and communicate this choice in writing to the board prior to the close of public hearing the board may approve such plan or special permit with or without conditions the board shall disapprove an application for a special permit only if it finds that either the conventional development conventional yield plan or the osrd development sketch plan is not a good faith design or that the plan that the applicant elects to pursue does not conform to the requirements of this bylaw the board may grant a special permit for an osrd if it determines that the proposed osrd has less detrimental impact on the tract than a conventional subdivision of the property and finding that the following eight 8 factors are satisfied 1 that the osrd achieves greater flexibility and creativity in the design of residential or unit developments than a conventional plan  2 that the osrd promotes permanent preservation of open space agricultural land forestry land other natural resources including water bodies and wetlands and historical and archaeological resources  3 that the osrd promotes a less sprawling and more efficient form of development that consumes less open land and conforms to existing topography and natural features better than a conventional subdivision  4 that the osrd reduces the total amount of disturbance on the site  5 that the osrd furthers the goals and policies of existing community planning documents including but not limited to the open space and recreation plan  6 that the osrd facilitates the construction and maintenance of streets utilities and public services in a more economical and efficient manner  7 that the concept plan and its supporting narrative documentation complies with all sections of this zoning bylaw
