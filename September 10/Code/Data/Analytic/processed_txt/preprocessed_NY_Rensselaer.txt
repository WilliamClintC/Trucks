officers are confronted daily with situations where control must be exercised to effect arrest and to protect the public safety control may be achieved warnings and persuasion or by the use of physical force while the use of reasonable physical force may be necessary in situations which cannot be otherwise controlled force may not be resorted to unless all other reasonable alternatives have been exhausted or would clearly be ineffective under the particular circumstances officers are permitted by new york state penal law to use whatever force is reasonable and necessary to protect others and themselves from bodily harm officers should bear in mind that of the penal law only authorizes use of physical forcedeadly physical force it does not command its use  4321 use of deadly physical force a no set of guidelines for the use of firearms can possibly cover every situation that might arise and every police officer is expected to respond to all such emergencies decisively with the highest level of good judgment and professional competence b officers should have a thorough knowledge of of the new york state penal law and should periodically review this body of law c in applying the above provision of the new york state penal law officers will be guided by the following procedures when considering the use of deadly physical force 1 a police officer is authorized to use firearms in the following circumstances if there is no other reasonable alternative available a to defend himself or another person from unlawful attack when he has reasonable cause or believes there is imminent danger of death or serious physical injury b to apprehend a person who is committing or has committed a crime in which deadly physical force has been used or threatened and when he has reasonable cause to believe that such person would cause death or serious bodily injury unless immediately apprehended c to kill a dangerous animal or an animal so badly injured that humanity requires that it be removed from further suffering in the case of an injured animal the permission of the owner should be obtained whenever possible great care should be taken to protect bystanders from a ricocheting bullet and if  4320 rensselaer city charter  4321 c191  4322 weapons policy possible the killing of an animal in the presence of children should be avoided 2 for authorized target practice

b to fire a weapon to effect an arrest except as provided for in 1a and b of this policy statement c to fire at or from a moving vehicle unless the occupants of the vehicle are using deadly physical force against the officer or another by means other than the vehicle itself 4 avoidance of recklessness should be considered in any situation involving deadly physical force even a case where deadly physical force is both authorized by law and reasonable under the circumstances the officer must consider the safety of innocent bystanders eg firing in a crowded street the fact that an officer is legally justified using deadly physical force does not constitute a license for reckless conduct by the police officer and such officer may be held criminally andor civilly liable 5 a police officer

rensselaer by prohibiting the service to and consumption of alcoholic beverages and drugs by persons under the age of 21 at private premises located in the city the city council finds that the occurrence of social gatherings at private premises where alcoholic beverages or drugs are served to or consumed by persons under the age of 21 is harmful to such persons themselves and a threat to public welfare health and safety the city council finds further that persons under the age of 21 often obtain alcoholic beverages or drugs at such gatherings and that persons who are in control of such premises know or have reason to know of such service andor consumption and will be more likely to ensure that alcoholic beverages and drugs are neither served to nor consumed by persons under the age of 21 at these gatherings f this article will hold those adults those over the age of 16 criminally responsible for underage alcohol or drug use on their premises g this article gives parents a tool to support their decision not to allow youth to consume alcohol on their property h this article holds those age 16 and over responsible for providing a place where someone elses child can

accelerates the maintenance needs of stormwater management facilities e clearing grading and altering natural topography during construction tends to increase erosion f improper design and construction of drainage facilities can increase the velocity of runoff thereby increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation g impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff
