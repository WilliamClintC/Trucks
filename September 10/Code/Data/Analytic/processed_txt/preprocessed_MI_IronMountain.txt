state law reference uses of land and structures mcl 12558 purpose a until recent years the regulation of all uses of land and structures has been accomplished by assigning each use to one or more districts however the functions and characteristics of an increasing number of new kinds of land uses combined with conclusive experience regarding some of the older more familiar kinds of uses call for a more flexible and equitable procedure for properly accommodating these activities in the community it should be recognized that the forces that influence decisions regarding the nature magnitude and location of such types of land use activities are many and varied depending upon functional characteristics competitive situations and the availability of land rather than assign all uses to special individual and limited zoning districts it is important to provide controllable and reasonable flexibility in requirements for certain kinds of uses that will allow practicable latitude for the investor but that will at the same time maintain adequate provision for the security of the health safety convenience and general welfare of the communitys inhabitants b in order to accomplish such a dual objective provision is made in this chapter for a more detailed consideration of certain specified activities as each may relate to proposed conditions of location design size operation intensity of use generation of traffic and traffic movements concentration of population processes and equipment employed and amount and kind of public facilities and services required together with many other possible factors land and structure uses possessing these particularly unique characteristics are designated as special uses and may be authorized by the issuance of a special use permit

management findings and intent conditions along the major highways in dickinson county are changing with increasing development and traffic continued development along us2us141 and m95 will further increase traffic volumes and introduce additional conflict points which will erode traffic operations and increase potential for traffic crashes numerous published studies document the positive relationship between welldesigned access management systems and traffic operations and safety those studies and the experiences of many other communities demonstrate that implementing standards on the number placement and design of access points driveways and side street intersections can preserve the capacity of the roadway and reduce the potential for crashes while preserving a good business environment and the existing investment in the highway the conditions along us2us141m95 and a series of access management recommendations are embodied in the us2us141m95 access management action plan among those recommendations are the creation of an overlay zone along these highways within dickinson county and the adoption of uniform access management standards by all the jurisdictions along the us2us141m95 corridor which are based on the michigan department of transportation access management standards and the michigan access management guidebook provided to local governments by the michigan department of transportation the provisions of this section are intended to promote safe and efficient travel on state highways within dickinson county  improve safety and reduce the potential for crashes  minimize disruptive and potentially hazardous traffic conflicts  ensure safe access by emergency vehicles  protect the substantial public investment in the highway and street system by

intersections where mdot indicates spacing and approach volumes may warrant a signal in the future 8 where direct access consistent with the various standards above cannot be achieved access should be via a shared driveway or service drive in particular the planning commission may require development of frontage roads or rear service drives where such facilities can provide access to signalized locations where service drives may minimize the number of driveways and as a means to ensure that traffic is able to more efficiently and safely ingress and egress 9 a sharing or joint use of a driveway by two or more property owners shall be encouraged in cases where access is restricted by the spacing requirements of subsection 3 above a shared driveway may be the only access design
