purpose and findings the mayor and council do hereby find that 1 it is the intent of mayor and council in enacting this division to recognize free speech rights for all citizens while at the same time

solicitation or that may give rise to interference with others activities if they occur in particular settings and contexts  and 2 mayor and council find that there are numerous forms of solicitation that are not in and of themselves inherently threatening or aggressive including vocal requests for a donation  carrying or displaying sign requesting donations  shaking of jingling a cup of change  and ringing a bell in compliance with the citys noise ordinance  and 3 however mayor and council find that there has been an increase in aggressive solicitation in the city which threatens the

the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within twentyfour 24 hours d 1 bypass is prohibited and the utility director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required

constitution of the state of georgia and ocga  36120a have delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the mayor and council of the city of warner robins do hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city of warner robins are subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this division to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands art v  1 3512 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give

division 7  stormwater utility findings the mayor and city council make the following findings of fact 1 warner robins is authorized by the georgia constitution of 198 including without limitation paragraph iii thereof and ocga  368262 to provide stormwater management services throughout warner robins 2 in order to protect the health safety and welfare of the public the government of warner robins hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund and establish rates for stormwater management services 3 in promulgating the regulations contained in this section warner robins is acting pursuant to authority granted by the constitution of the state of georgia and the city charter of warner robins to provide for stormwater collection and disposal 4 improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands threaten businesses and residences and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers streams and other bodies of water within warner robins 5 a system for the collection conveyance storage treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within warner robins and surrounding areas 6 warner robins presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years the future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city and the additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city in order to do so the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainagerelated capital improvement needs 7 failure to effectively manage stormwater can adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the warner robins thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system 8 failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the further degradation of the water quality in area waterbodies which may result in higher levels of treatment requirements imposed on warner robins wastewater treatment facilities and increased water treatment cost of potable water supplies by warner robins 9 proper management of stormwater is a key element of having clean water with adequate assimilative capacity for treated wastewater discharges and adequate potable drinking water that are essential to support existing development as well as future development and redevelopment in warner robins 10 the city is required under federal and state regulations ie the citys national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes phase ii georgia notice of intent noi and stormwater permit effective  to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 and stormwater conveyance system into state of georgia or united states waters therefore it is appropriate for the city to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge directly or indirectly into the public ms4 and stormwater conveyance system whether the property is private or public in nature 11 compliance with the regulatory obligations of the npdes phase ii stormwater permit along with other city stormwater program activities will substantially increase the cost of providing stormwater management services above what is currently being spent for water quality management drainage system maintenance flood control and other program activities 12 the cost of operating and maintaining the warner robins stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs replacements improvements and extensions thereof should to the extent practicable be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system 13 the professional engineering and financing analysis known as the stormwater utility implementation report including amendments and related documents dated august 2005 and prepared by the citys consulting stormwater engineer which report is incorporated herein by express reference properly assesses and defines the citys stormwater management program problems needs goals priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy 14 given the stormwater management program problems needs goals priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater management systems within the city in concert with other water resource management programs 15 stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city while specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community 16 the stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protection of the public health safety and welfare of the community provision of stormwater management services renders andor results in both a service and a benefit to all properties property owners citizens and residents of the city in a variety of ways as described in the stormwater utility implementation report 17 the services and benefits rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management services may differ depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs and risk exposure it is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties impose on the citys stormwater management services which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof 18 a stormwater management program swmp provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services within the city user fee charges user fees and other mechanisms as described in the stormwater utility implementation report and the other related documents that have been prepared for the city by its consultants 19 a schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city such user fee charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs including but not limited to special service fees special assessments revenue bonds use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council 20 the existence of privately owned and maintained onsite or offsite systems facilities activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the citys swmp and the stormwater utilitys cost of providing stormwater management services andor stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit and such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services systems facilities activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility manager reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems facilities activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the property 21 the area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge 22 it is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services be dedicated solely to those purposes and such proceeds of user fee charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital operating and nonoperating costs lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes  12406 definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this article shall have the

the year 2005 warner robins transportation plan in order to protect the safety lives and property of the general public who travel upon the state highways of georgia to maintain the capacity and operating efficiency of these state highways and to provide reasonable access to these state highways from those contiguous properties for which access control is not vested in the department the following guidelines and requirements on the permitting of driveway access are established i commercial property driveways a single business enterprise on a single interior lot 1 movements confined primarily to onsite employees totaling no more than 40  one 2way drive 2 movements consisting primarily of in and out customer activities where no more than 50 parking spaces are on the site or sites with less than 300 of frontage  one 2way drive or two 1way drives 3 fast food operations bank with drivemedical offices and other facilities with more than 50 onsite parking spaces and a minimum of 300 of frontage  two 2way drives 4 automobile service stations and gas station minimarts which include gas and oil sales and which have a minimum frontage of 150  two 2way drives b single businesses on corner lot 1 one 2way driveway on mainline and one 2way driveway on the cross road totaling two 2way driveways driveways are to be located as far as practical from the intersection two 1way driveways may be substituted for one 2way drive c multiple businesses on commercial tracts 1 up to 300 linear feet of frontage  one 2way drive on two 1way drives 2 frontages between 300 and 1000 linear feet  two 2way drives 3 frontages from 1000 linear feet to 2000 linear feet  three 2way drives 4 frontages from 2000 linear feet to 3000 linear feet  three 2way driveways or two 1way driveways and 1 multilane driveway 5 frontages of over 3000 linear feet  driveways as determined on a casebycase basis d accelerationdeceleration lane requirements commercial driveways except those permitted under item a1 will normally include appropriate accelerationdeceleration lanes such lanes shall be constructed by the developer at no cost to the department the rightofway for such lanes shall be dedicated to the department by the developer the pavement sections for accelerationdeceleration lanes shall match that of the mainline accelerationdeceleration lanes may be required under item a1 if they are considered necessary e left turn lanes at commercial driveways for mainline sections without a divided median the department may require the construction of left turn lanes at commercial driveways for roadways of two four or sixlane sections and no divided median this requirement will be based upon analyses of the capacity constraints imposed upon the roadway by left turns out of lanes giving consideration to current and 20year projected traffic volumes f access conveyance once the number and configuration of driveways has been established the developer of commercial property will be requested to deed access control rights along his frontage to the department for this purpose commercial property includes residential subdivisions discussed under item iid g rightofway conveyance developers of commercial property and residential property as discussed under item iid will be requested to deed rightofway for future widening of the mainline highway where such is included in the departments construction work program ii residential subdivisions a in no event will the state highway be used as a subdivision street with individual lot driveways b for definition of subdivision and the provisions and requirements for review of subdivision plats by the department and the responsibilities of local planning and zoning commissions and individuals to submit subdivision plats to the department for review and comment refer to georgia  326152 326153 and 326154 c those not requiring review by the department driveway permits shall be issued by the district this authority may be delegated to the area engineer d those requiring review by the department the district with guidance from the state transportation traffic and safety engineer shall review and comment upon the subdivision plat comments shall address access to the state highway possible solutions shall consider one two or three connections depending upon frontage to an interior road system upon which the residential lots front a frontage road parallel and adjacent to the state highway upon which the lots will front which will also have connections to the state highway system or in extreme cases a pairing of two lots per driveway this latter circumstance is not desirable and should be a last resort settlement limited to frontage less than 1000 feet where a small number of large frontage lots are involved individual driveways may be allowed e subdivisions of property to accommodate the residential needs of family members of the owner of the tract shall be handled as private residences iii these guidelines address only the number of connections to be allowed to the state highway system our current permit requirements with respect to engineering are unchanged  appendix b
