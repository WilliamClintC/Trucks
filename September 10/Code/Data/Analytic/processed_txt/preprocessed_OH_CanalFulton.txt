codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which

are criteria to be used in evaluating appropriateness of structures andor alterations of such structures within the historic district aspacing 1lot coverage is the percentage of lot area covered by the primary structure  building to lot coverage provides an important component of building spacing by being a measure of the density of developed land along each block front and on each lot new construction should have a lot coverage similar to those of existing buildings in the area for example compare  images0002785jpg  2setback is the distance from the edge of the right of way to the building front uniformity of front yard setback establishes a framework of order and coherence and insures a strong and continuous streetscape consistency of setback is an especially important unifying factor where building styles vary for example compare  images0002788jpg  3building height is the distance from the average finished grade at its intersection with the front of the building to the highest point of the building consistency of height is an important factor contributing to the scale and character of an area buildings quite different from the predominate pattern of an area will disrupt the areas structural relatedness it should be realized that the perceived height frequently differs from actual height the perceived height is a product of the number of stories the relationship of height and width the height of porches and other visual factors the actual height depends mainly on the height of each story and pitch of the roof both measurements of height should be considered for example compare  images0002791jpg  4spacing of buildings refers to the distance between adjacent buildings closely spaced buildings have a strong spatial tension or attraction between them while buildings distant from each other have little force of attraction additionally regular patterns of spacing convey a sense of order and cohesion  regularity of rhythm adds strength and continuity to the streetscape for an observer moving along a street the spacing of buildings will be affected by the minimum side yard requirements in the zoning for example compare  images0002794jpg  barchitectural design components architectural design components refers to aspects of the design of each individual building these components must be compatible within the building as a unit as well as with the buildingss surroundings design components help provide a sense of unity and coherence within the historic area 1exterior building and roofing materials the dominant building material for a particular streetscape may be brick or wood siding for example  or the dominant roofing material may be asbestos shingles or tin a mixture of materials adds variety to an area but a degree of variety which becomes chaotic should be avoided ideally materials used in new construction or remodeling should exhibit an affinity with existing materials in the area additionally some buildings and roofing materials such as artificial brick or stone siding may be inappropriate for the style or character of existing buildings  the use of such materials in remodeling should be discouraged 2exterior texture effects result from the nature of the materials used such as the horizontal regularity of wood siding or the roughness of brick with tooled joints texture may also result from the repetition of architectural details such as porch balustrades new buildings using textured materials or details are less obtrusive in old areas of finely scaled detail 3proportion of width to height of openings this proportion of width to height applies to openings within the facade such as doors and windows in a sequence of buildings the use of similarly proportioned openings will help establish the relatedness of structures openings which vary significantly from that which exists in surrounding buildings may have a disruptive effect on the character of an area for example compare  images0002797jpg  4architectural styles use of forms which are especially indigenous to the area such as porches or cupolas should be encouraged in order to enhance the elements which contribute to the distinctive character of the district motifs in detailing which are prevalent in the district such as certain stained glass forms or types of bracketing should be retained whenever possible for their continued contribution to the areas unique qualities 5roof form and pitch in relation to facade roof forms in a given streetscape may be gable hip gambrel mansard or flat and pitches may vary roof forms and pitches should be in harmony with the predominant type in the neighborhood for example compare  images0002800jpg  6shape and form of the building the basic shape and form of the facades of new structures or additions should be compatible with facades shapes and forms already existing in the area facades with highly or unorthodox shapes and forms may not be in harmony with existing structures and they may call undue amounts of attention to themselves similar consideration should likewise be given to the shape and form of the building as a whole construction of additions and appendages should follow the guidelines under subsection b hereof so that they will respect the original design in the use of materials and details as well as shape and form however it must be recognized that victorian architecture delighted in unusual shapes and forms and asymmetry victorian houses may have polygonal bays turrets unusual gables and oddly placed windows unusual additions to such structures may be entirely compatible with the original design and may fit well in the neighborhood if they are thoughtfully designed 7architectural detailing details such as lintels stained glass foundation materials and chimneys give a building or set of buildings an identity and distinctive character older buildings in particular tend to display a very fine level of detail new construction should seek to reflect the level of detail in an area  blank facades introduced into an area of detailed buildings will disrupt the quality of design 8color appropriate paint colors should be recommended for each building according to the age and architecture represented the colors of adjacent buildings as well as the streetscape in general should be taken into account it might be decided for instance that where red is an appropriate color based upon the age and architecture of the building it might still be preferable to decide in favor of gray because of colors of the adjacent structures and the general streetscape when the concern is with new construction in a preservation district care should be taken to avoid colors of contemporary origin that clash or loudly contrast with the older colors earth shades are preferable for new construction or colors which predominate in the surrounding older buildings so as to minimize the impact of any conflict in design it should be noted here that excellent contemporary architecture is not in conflict with the concept of a preservation district it is only necessary that due consideration is given to the spirit and atmosphere of the immediate area color choices will be conditioned upon the areas of color surfaces involved the material to be affected and the issue of building color versus signage or accent color no prior draft of rules can possibly determine color appropriateness in all areas csignage the existing articles of the zoning with signage would apply to the historic district with the additional guidelines 1the signage for a particular building or shop be reduced to the fewest separate panels andor statements possible the description of goods or services beyond the basic statement of the nature of the business should be restricted example the old world delicatessen would not be followed with the usual wine pop cola beer and party mixes sold here any owner has the right to place signage within the shop window to more fully elaborate on his goods providing the signs are not contrary to the intent of the total signage criteria see subsection c5 hereof 2most buildings are designed with a definite panel or framed zone for the sign mounting this should be used with the sign taking a complimentary shape 3letter styles are many keep to one or at most two styles or faces at each shop this enhances readability as well as creates a more dependable logo for the shop 4colors are a highly subjective item colors should be highly compatible within the sign itself and should correlate with the building colors bizarre color combinations intended to shock the eye should be restricted as being incompatible with the streetscape good contrast is essential for distant readability some established logos will warrant recognition 5material used can be a variable but natural looking materials are desirable 6excellent signs already in place would be cited as a guide for future signmaking petitioners a body of sign photos or drawings from elsewhere can be used as preliminary guidelines 7signage needed for public instruction should be the subject of a special program and assignment wherein all existing signage locational directional instructive be reviewed for effective size placement and message a new consistent logo and letter style should be developed and put to use in future sign replacement the culminating design should reflect excellence of letter design  clear and vigorous not whimsical 8signage need not always be externally fixed on a building the fine art of lettering on glass once very common deserves a comeback and would be a sound solution projecting signs can be highly successful if thoughtfully styled and scaled to avoid either a heavy or a trivial appearance the goal is to match sign with building or product and to do so within reasonable limits of size and placement and with compatibility with the streetscape 9it is further recommended that no signage of commercial nature be erected in the right of way or tree lawn vistas up and down the street are injured by such pole or stemmounted signs especially where excellent tree forms cover the message in the first place projecting signs are not out of place when formally attached to the building facade but their size becomes critical to avoid blocking the view of the buildings beyond passed 91978  second signs in the spirit of historic preservation and the beautification of the canal corridor the historic preservation commission may authorize the zoning inspector to issue a permit for a second sign to be attached to a building in the following circumstances athe second sign must be a part of a building beautification project that enhances the objectives of the historic preservation commission bthe second sign shall not exceed the size of the sign approved for the front of the building or twenty square feet whichever is smaller ca second sign may be permitted only when the back of the building faces the canal or the building has frontage on two streets da certificate of appropriateness must be issued as provided in this chapter eno more than two signs may be approved for any one building passed 6705 117506 demolition or removal of a structure ademolition or removal procedure the zoning inspector shall notify the commission of any application involving the demolition partial demolition or removal of a structure or a significant accessory structure the commission shall schedule a public hearing at a date within thirty days of filing of application with the zoning inspector with proper notification newspaper at least ten days prior to the hearing and shall notify the applicant in writing at the hearing the commission shall be able to request any or all of the following information 1a report from the commission architect on the state of repair and structural stability of the structure under consideration 2information and graphics on the extent and process of demolition or removal including information on any proposed changes in landscaping 3evidence of any hardship that would result in substantial economic loss to the applicant from denial of the petition 4an assessment of any alterations in the essential character of the area which would occur as a result of the demolition or removal action bdecision of the commission if the commission decision is to postpone the demolition or removal the commission shall notify the owner in writing during the period set forth for postponement of the requested action the commission shall explore alternatives to demolition or removal the period set for postponement of the requested action shall not be greater than six months from the time of filing the request with the
