information packet model road maintenance agreement has been produced for the purpose of informing 16editors note see ch 260 zoning  22048 general provisions  22050  delaware county towns and villages of the existence of such agreements a road maintenance agreement rma can be required by towns and villages for subdivisions in order to ensure adequate accessibility of emergency vehicles and if done in the future to make the transfer of a road from the private to public a more effortless process in that roads will already meet subdivision road standards b an rma is an agreement which is intended to establish the rights and duties of lot owners with respect to maintenance of a private road the private road provides access from a public road to existing residential lots and to additional lots which may be created subdivisions an rma is an agreement between all landowners on a private road in which an understanding or agreement is made stating that a specified timely contribution will be made by the owners fronting on the private road for the purpose of repairing and maintaining the private road the time to make such an agreement is during subdivision review when all the lots are owned by the same person c the primary purpose of the agreement is to assure that the road remains in good repair maintenance considerations should include proper drainage width and snow removal of the private road the importance of such upkeep and repair is of particular concern to the town or village in which the private road resides when considering emergency access to the road the maintenance see attached sample rma agreement should state that the road shall be maintained to the minimum standards required by the town or village d the lot owners agreement should state the amount of money that will be spent on yearly maintenance and stipulate that any additional money required for maintenance will not be spent until consent of an agreementupon percent of the landowners is obtained e the amount of money to be contributed by each owner for road repairs can be determined according to several types of ownership criteria the criteria are as follows 1 prorated share based upon the number of lots fronting said road at the beginning of each year standard practice  2 prorated share based upon the assessed value of each owners property  3 prorated share based upon the distance the property owner lives up the road f the lot owners should elect an officer to handle the details of the agreement including organizing and contracting out the repairs and maintenance of the private road voting rights shall be such that each 17editors note a sample road maintenance agreement is included as an attachment to this chapter  22050 walton code  22050  lot owner shall be limited to one vote however each property owners vote may be weighted according to ownership criteria as stated above voting may be necessary in circumstances where additional moneys are requested by the officer for further repairs or for additional improvements beyond those included in the agreement g it should be stated in the rma that existing lots andor future lots created on the road are required to enter into the rma h towns and villages may require that all rmas be filed with the new york state attorney generals office town or village clerktreasurer and village board it is important that the agreement be on record in the event that any lot owner violates the provisions of the agreement any other lot owner may initiate any proceeding for the recovery of damages against the persons violating the agreement i towns and villages have the authority to require the maintenance of private roads using this authority is beneficial to both the town or village and the public in that it guarantees that future subdivision roads will be maintained to the level that the subdivision regulations require when the road is originally constructed hence the certainty of emergency vehicles being able to easily maneuver on such roads will be guaranteed also if transfer of a road from private to public occurs the road will not require much improvement making the transfer a less difficult
