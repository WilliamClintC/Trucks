comparative codified ordinances of tallmadge ohio   charter   part one  administrative three  traffic five  general offenses seven  business regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention editors note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position   enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting

probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact ca person acts recklessly when with heedless indifference to the consequences the

activities may result in spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis gonorrhea and human immunodeficiency virus hiv 3offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage such

maintain their facilities 5numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented films 6the findings noted

public health safety and welfare 11requiring sufficient lighting in all sexually oriented businesses will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal activity on the premises of

employed in a sexually oriented business or adult motel 14barring such individuals from the management of and employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to

dopen spaces should be linked together enatural separation should be preserved or created on the site by careful planning of the streets and clustering of buildings using natural features and open spaces for separation existing vegetation removal should be kept to a minimum fscreening of intensive uses should be provided by utilizing landscaping fences or walls to enclose internal areas gbuildings should be sited in an orderly nonrandom fashion long unbroken building facades should be avoided hin connection with the siting of multiple story buildings the location should be oriented to maximize the privacy of the occupants of adjacent buildings  ipedestrian circulation in nonresidential areas should be arranged so that offstreet parking areas are located within a convenient walking distance of the use being served handicapped parking should be located as near as possible to be accessible to the structure pedestrian and vehicular circulation should be separated as much as possible designated by pavement markings signalization or complete grade separation jpath and sidewalk street crossings should be located where there is a good sight distance along the road preferably away from sharp bends or sudden changes in grade kparking lots and garages should be located in such a way as to provide safe convenient ingress and egress whenever possible there should be a sharing of curb cuts of more than one facility parking areas should be screened and landscaped and traffic islands should be provided to protect circulating vehicles and to break up the monotony of

71310 administration and enforcement  see p & z ch 1135  118901 purpose auntil recent years the regulation of all uses of land and structures has been accomplished by assigning each use to one or more use districts however the functions and characteristics of an increasing number of new kinds of land uses combined with conclusive experience regarding some of the older familiar kinds of uses call for a more flexible and equitable procedure for properly accommodating these activities in the community it should be recognized that the forces that influence decisions regarding the nature magnitude and location of such types of land use activities are many and varied depending upon functional characteristics competitive situations and the availability of land rather than assign all uses to special individual and limited zoning districts it is important to provide controllable and reasonable flexibility in requirements for certain kinds of uses that will allow practicable latitude for the investor but that will at the same time maintain adequate provision for the security of the health safety convenience and general welfare of the communitys inhabitants bin order to accomplish such a dual objective provision is made in this a more detailed consideration of each of certain specified activities as it may relate to proposed conditions of location design size operation intensity of

riparian setback 119011inspection 119001 purpose athe city of tallmadge has determined that the system of streams within the city contributes to the health safety and general welfare of the residents of the city the purpose of this chapter is to protect and preserve the water quality within streams of the city and to protect residents of the city from property loss and damage because of flooding and other impacts of the stream the city will implement this chapter by controlling uses and developments within a riparian setback that would impair the ability of the riparian area to 1reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows slowing the velocity of flood waters and regulating base flow 2stabilize the banks of streams to reduce bank erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from stream banks 3reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by filtering settling and transforming pollutants already present in streams or in runoff before they enter streams 4provide areas for natural meandering and lateral movement of stream channels 5reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain diverse and connected riparian vegetation 6provide high quality stream habitats with shade and food to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian vegetation 7benefit the city economically by minimizing encroachment on stream channels and reducing the need for costly engineering solutions such as dams and riprap to protect structures and reduce property damage and threats to the safety of watershed residents and by contributing to the scenic beauty and to the environment of the city the quality of life of the residents of the city and corresponding property values bthis chapter has been enacted to protect these
