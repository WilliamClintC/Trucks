of the city serve uniquely different functions the narrative below describes each of the districts some of the districts may share similar characteristics but they possess one 1 or more uniquely different qualities that allow a distinction to be drawn between them although an area may not now possess each of the attributes in these descriptions it is intended that as uses change over time they more closely reflect the intended uses uses are allowed in the various districts consistent with the development standards in this title and development limitations that may be present including steep slopes floodplains wetlands riparian areas and other environmentally sensitive areas the city is divided into the following base districts as shown on the official zoning map 1 r1 singlefamily suburban this district is intended to accommodate comparatively lowdensity singlefamily residential development on larger lots home occupations can occur in this district to the extent they are compatible with residential uses found in this district 2 r2 singlefamily medium density this district is intended to accommodate mediumdensity singlefamily residential development on moderatesized lots home occupations can occur in this district to the extent they are compatible with residential uses found in this district schools and other public facilities are often found in close proximity 3 r3 singlefamily high density this district is intended to accommodate singlefamily residences at the highest urban density home occupations can occur in this district to the extent they are compatible with residential uses found in this district schools and other public facilities are often found in close proximity 4 r5 multifamily residential medium density this district is intended to accommodate multifamily units not exceeding twostories given the higher densities these districts are typically close to work and leisure 5 r6 multifamily residential high density this district is intended to accommodate multifamily units of the highest density allowed in the city these districts are typically found close to work and leisure and are close to the downtown 6 r9 mixed residential this district contains a mix of housing types including singlefamily twofamily and multifamily dwellings all permitted existing residential densities in the r9 district are considered to be conforming and are allowed to be reestablished if damaged any increase in density shall only be permitted as a conditional use new projects developing under this classification must be at least five 5 acres in size and include a mix of housing types consistent with a set of prescribed standards 7 r10 mobile home park this district is for the exclusive use and development of mobile home parks 8 c1 neighborhood commercial this district is found near established and developing residential areas and is intended to accommodate low intensity commercial activities that serve the nearby residential area development standards ensure the compatibility of this district to those residential districts that may adjoin 9 c2 general commercial this district is primarily intended to accommodate hightraffic businesses that focus on vehicle traffic where this district abuts a residential district appropriate screening and landscaping will be provided to lessen associated impacts current residential uses are not considered nonconforming as such current residential uses existing at the time this title was adopted are allowed to expand or to be reestablished if damaged 10 c3 highway commercial this district is intended to accommodate those commercial activities that primarily cater to those traveling on the interstate as such this district is only found at interchanges 11 c4 central business core this district is intended to accommodate and create a high level of business and social activity from morning nighttime hours this district hosts a wide range of employment and businesses retail operations and specialty stores are common on the street level along with professional offices residential uses can occur in this district primarily on the upper levels of buildings entertainment

downtown it is intended to serve as a buffer between the downtown area and the surrounding residential districts although commercial uses are allowed in this district they are typically businesses with lower levels of traffic compared to those found in the downtown area buildings are smaller in this district to create a physical transition in building bulk from predominant residential uses and the intensely developed downtown area buildings have setbacks and landscaping requirements exterior storage or display is not allowed 13 m1 mixeduse the mixeduse district is intended to allow a balanced and harmonious mixture of commercial residential institutional uses and public spaces employment opportunities are near a variety of living options a mix of uses could occur within the same building or in separate buildings in close proximity to one another the transportation system and buildings are designed with pedestrians in mind 14 m2 mixeduse transitional this district is intended to promote a transition over time to a predominately mixeduse land use pattern because of changing economic conditions and other factors some current uses do not represent the highest and best use given other more suitable areas current industrial uses and warehouses are not considered nonconforming as such current industrial uses and warehouses existing at the time this title was adopted are allowed to expand or to be reestablished if damaged provided development and appearance standards under the purview of the design review board are met see  uses characteristic of this district are the same as those found in the previously described m1 district 15 pli public lands and institutional this district is intended to include areas of significant public lands including public schools and

districts enumerated above the city is also divided into the following overlay districts as shown on the official zoning map to account for unique conditions or requirements as further described in subsequent chapters 1 neighborhood conservation overlay districts this overlay district is intended to protect characteristics typically found in older neighborhoods design standards help to perpetuate the best features of the neighborhood as buildings are renovated maintained and potentially redeveloped the provisions relating to this overlay district are contained in of this title 2 great falls international airport overlay districts overlay districts are established around the great falls international airport to limit the height of buildings and other obstructions near the airport noise zones are also established around great falls international airport to ensure that land uses are compatible with the continued functioning of the airport with special consideration on noise compatibility the provisions relating to these overlay districts are contained in of this title 3 floodplain overlay districts the floodplain overlay districts are based on flood studies

contained in of this title 4 southside business overlay district this overlay district is created to recognize the historic design and utilization of existing structures in the commercial district immediately south of the central business core comprising mainly a portion of the c5 zoning district and some adjacent properties in other zoning districts this overly district allows for flexibility

legislative findings the city commission makes the following findings 1 a welldeveloped and wellmaintained street system is needed to provide proper access to property and efficient traffic circulation 2 streets serve two 2 competing functions property access and movement of goods and people when the number of accesses onto a hightraffic street increases traffic efficiency declines and safety is jeopardized 3 the function of a street number of lots served traffic level requirements of emergency services and driver expectations should dictate the street standards in terms of surface width rightofway width maximum grade and so on for example a hightraffic street should be built to a higher standard than a street that serves a few residential lots 4 an interconnected street system is preferable to a street system where culdesacs are used extensively 5 streets are an important factor in community and subdivision design improperly designed streets and intersections can negatively affect the safety and efficiency of public streets create unnecessary maintenance costs limit a parcels development potential and limit a projects desirability 6 excessive street standards that do not further the public health safety and welfare are unnecessary and add to development costs 7 traffic control devices at hightraffic locations are needed to ensure efficient and safe vehicular and pedestrian movement 8 the advantages of a single access point to a major residential project greater sense of security and elimination of traffic are outweighed by the advantages of multiple access points which include reduced internal congestion and diffusion of the developments full traffic impact to the external public street system 9 street intersections are points of conflict and potential hazard street intersections should be designed to afford drivers complete and unobstructed view of approaching traffic to enable them to safely enter or cross the traffic flow 10 traffic calming techniques when properly designed can be used to enhance safety   purpose this chapter is established to promote the public health safety and welfare and is intended to accomplish the following purposes 1 establish a hierarchy of street types with corresponding development standards 2 optimize efficient traffic movement 3 optimize traffic safety 4 ensure legal access to all parcels of land 5 minimize adverse environmental impacts from street development 6 create functional and attractive developments that will be an asset to the community 7 reduce the number of conflict points between pedestrians and vehicles 8 ensure that all streets accommodate the requirements of emergency vehicles for ingress and egress 9 establish standards to ensure adequate sight distances at street intersections so that motorists at an intersection are able to see approaching traffic and allow them to safely enter or cross the traffic flow 10 minimize the surface area of streets thereby reducing stormwater runoff and increasing groundwater infiltration   street classification a street types all existing and proposed streets in the city shall be classified as one 1 of the following 1 principal

the following findings 1 the design of parking areas is critically important to the economic viability of commercial areas pedestrian and driver safety the efficient and safe operation of adjoining streets and community image and livability 2 standards are needed to establish the minimum and maximum number of parking spaces that are needed to serve various land uses 3 excessive parking lots reduce density increase the cost of development create an unhealthy built environment contribute to the heat island effect associated with urban areas and decrease the infiltration of stormwater into the ground 4 special standards are needed to accommodate the needs of the disabled 5 a growing number of people use or would like to use bicycles for recreation commuting and general transportation 6 inadequate bicycle parking facilities and fear of theft are major deterrents to bicycle transportation 7 shared parking can reduce parking facility costs including aesthetic and environmental impacts allows greater flexibility in facility location and site design and encourages more efficient land use 8 parking lots and their access represent a vital connection between the local transportation network and land development 9 incorrectly designed parking lots and site access have negative impacts on the site itself the adjacent and nearby public roadways and the image of the business district river corridor and the city 020  purpose this chapter is established to promote the public health safety and general welfare and is intended to accomplish the following purposes 1 increase the safety

findings 1 the runway protection zone is entirely located on the property under control of the great falls international airport gfia 2 based on statistics compiled by the national transportation safety board the majority of aircraft accidents occur at airports or in the immediate area of the extended centerline of the runway 3 given the increased level of risk associated with landings and takeoffs it is important to protect the approach and departure ends of each runway 4 some types of land uses can be located near airports because they are compatible with the proper functioning and continued operation of airports while others are not examples of incompatible land uses include tall structures and buildings residential places of public assembly and uses that cause electronic interference glare smoke emissions or dust or that attract birds and wildlife 5 some types of buildings can be designed to reduce the effects of airportrelated noise on its occupants while others cannot 6 inappropriate development near airports increases the perceived impact of aircraft noise 7 uncontrolled growth and development around airports present a clear threat to the safety of those in aircraft and those on the ground 8 the state has authorized the city to adopt regulations regarding the height of structures and uses of land around airports 9 in developing the regulations contained in this chapter the following factors were considered the character of the flying operations expected to be conducted at the airport the nature of the terrain within the area the character of surrounding land uses and the uses to which the property to be zoned is put and adaptable 10 in developing the noise regulations contained in this chapter the following factors were considered the safety of airport users and persons and property in the vicinity of the airport  the character of the flying operations conducted or expected to be conducted at the airport  the magnitude and duration of noise produced by aircraft and the number of aircraft flybys  the nature of the terrain  the future development of the airport  and the views and mandates of the federal agency charged with fostering of civil aeronautics as to the aerial surfaces necessary for flying operations   purpose this chapter is established to promote the public health safety and welfare and is intended to accomplish the following purposes 1 minimize the conflicts between airport operations and surrounding land uses by imposing limitations on the height of structures and objects of natural growth and land use 2 ensure that people buying property near the airport are aware of the potential noise levels and risks associated with the continued operation of the airport 3 protect the significant public and private investments already made at the great falls international airport and malmstrom air force base   applicability a generally this chapter applies to the land within the city limits b

falls evasion criteria for local determination of evasion of the subdivision and platting act legislative findings the city commission makes the following findings 1 the legislature in adopting and amending the subdivision and platting act 763101 et seq mca act has presumed a that parcels of land containing less than one hundred sixty 160 acres are building sites and that the creation of these parcels should be reviewed and approved by the local governing body applying the primary review criteria set forth in 763608 mca b that the exemptions from subdivision review under 763201 and 763207 mca are intended to relieve a landowner from the requirements of local review when the division of land either creates no additional building sites or creates so few building sites that only minimal impact will likely result c that the purpose of the exemptions is not to provide a means of creating numerous building sites without subdivision review but rather to deal with the exceptional circumstances when subdivision review is unnecessary 2 the montana supreme court decisions in florencecarlton school district vs ravalli county board of commissioners 1978  leach v visser 1989  and state ex rel dreher v fuller 1993  have recognized a governing bodys right to narrowly interpret and enforce the provisions of the montana subdivision and platting act especially those pertaining to the use of exemptions 3 the parcels of land created by exemptions often do not provide for a the coordination of roads within the divided land or with other roads both existing and planned b the dedication of land for roadways and public utility easements c the provision of adequate open spaces for travel light air and recreation d the provision of adequate transportation water drainage and sanitary facilities e the avoidance of minimizing of congestion f the avoidance of land division that would involve unnecessary environmental degradation g the avoidance of danger or injury to health safety or welfare by reason of natural hazard or the lack of water drainage access transportation schools or other public services or would necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services 4 the likelihood that land development problems will occur is greatly increased when building sites are created without public review and are further divided without review 5 the city commission of the city of great falls has established the necessary procedures for expedient review of subdivisions creating five 5 or fewer parcels and thus has diminished justification for avoiding review of exemptions purpose to provide criteria to guide the city of great falls in determining when the use of an exemption from subdivision review is adopted to evade the purpose of the subdivision and platting act procedures and general requirements a evidence of claimed exemption any person seeking exemption from the requirements of the subdivision and platting act 763101 et seq mca shall submit to the planning department or other designated agent 1 a certificate of survey or where a survey is not required an instrument of conveyance and 2 evidence of and an affidavit affirming entitlement to the claimed exemption b review of evidence when a certificate of survey or instrument of conveyance is submitted the planning department or other designated agent shall cause the documents to be reviewed by the planning department and the city engineer the planning department and the city engineer shall review the proposed land division to determine whether it complies with the requirements set forth herein in the montana subdivision and platting act and the montana sanitation in subdivisions act c written determination after the review to evaluate compliance with the requirements contained herein the agents shall submit a written determination whether the use of the exemption is intended to evade the purposes of the act d following compliance determination if the designated agents find that the proposed use of the exemption complies with the statutes and these criteria they shall advise the clerk and recorder to file the certificate of survey or record the instrument of conveyance and accompanying documents if the agents find the proposed use of the exemption does not comply with the statutes and these criteria they shall advise the clerk and recorder to not file or record the documents and the clerk shall return the materials to the landowner e denial of exemption and rebuttable presumption  appeal any person whose proposed use of exemption has been denied by the designated agents because the use of the exemption raised a rebuttable presumption established by these guidelines may appeal the agents decision to the city commission of the city of great falls the person may request a hearing and may submit additional evidence to show that the use of the exemption in question is not intended to evade the act and thereby overcome the rebuttable presumption if the governing body concludes that the evidence and information overcomes the presumption that the exemption is being invoked to evade the act they may authorize the use of the exemption in writing a certificate of survey claiming such an exemption from the subdivision review which otherwise is in proper form may be filed or an instrument of conveyance recorded if it is accompanied by written authorization of the governing body if the use of an exemption is determined to be an evasion of the act the landowner may submit a subdivision application for the proposed land division f advisory examination landowners or their representatives are encouraged to meet with the citys designated agents to discuss whether a proposed land division or use of an exemption is in compliance with these criteria the agents may issue an advisory opinion only and the opinion creates no commitment on the local officials when the documents creating the proposed land division are submitted to the local governing body g consideration of surrounding circumstances the city commission of the city of great falls and its agents when determining whether an exemption is claimed for the purpose of evading the act shall consider all of the surrounding circumstances these circumstances may include but are not limited to the nature of the claimants business the prior history of the particular tract in question the proposed configuration of the tracts if the proposed exempt transaction are completed and any pattern of exempt transactions that will result in the equivalent of a subdivision without local government review state ex rel dreher v fuller 50 st rptr 454 1993 h development pattern equivalent to a subdivision exempt divisions of land that would result in a pattern of development equivalent to a subdivision shall be presumed to be adopted for purposes of evading the act a pattern of development occurs whenever three 3 or more parcels of less than one hundred sixty 160 acres with common covenants or facilities have been divided from the original tract i creation of nonconforming lots the city of great falls will not allow to be filed any subdivision plats or certificates of survey that create lots that are not conforming to the zoning district in which those lots are located the city of great falls will not allow to be filed any subdivision plats or certificates of survey that further exacerbates an existing nonconforming parcel including but not limited to reducing the sizes of existing nonconforming parcels line changes or creating parcels in which setbacks are in violation of the city land development physical access requirements the city of great falls will not allow to be filed any certificates of survey where legal and physical access is not provided to each lot shown on the certificate of survey legal and physical access shall be at least sixty 60 feet in width to allow for access to parcels for public health safety and welfare concerns if a sixty 60 foot wide access is not physically possible the city may upon a showing of good cause allow for an access of less than sixty 60 feet in width pattern of development the scope of review of a pattern of development shall apply to the creation of a parcel of land or multiple divisions of land by use of or proposed use of an exemptions a original tract less than twenty 20 acres a pattern of development occurs whenever three 3 or more parcels ie two 2 exempt parcels and a remaining parcel have been divided from the original tract of less than twenty 20 acres regardless of ownership by use of exemptions from the act b original tract twenty 20 acres or more a pattern of development occurs whenever more than four 4 parcels under twenty 20 acres ie three 3 exempt parcels and a remaining parcel have been divided from the original tract of twenty 20 acres or more regardless of ownership by use of exemptions from the act a pattern of development may be evidenced by the use of exemptions contiguous to platted lots where common roads are shared or the exempted tracts have similar shape or size to the platted lots or the exempted tracts are being created by the same landowner who created the platted lots exemption as a gift or sale to a member of the immediate family 7632071b mca a statement of intent the intention of this exemption is to allow a landowner to convey one 1 parcel to each member of the immediate family without local subdivision review a single parcel may be conveyed to each member of the immediate family under this exemption in each county where the landowner owns property a proposed division of land as a family transfer may be declared to be an evasion of the act if it is determined that one 1 of the following conditions exists 1 the proposed parcel would result in a pattern of development  2 the division is made for the purpose of speculation by the grantor or for resale for the benefit of the grantor by using the grantee as a strawperson  3 the transfer is the second or subsequent family transfer to the same member of the immediate family where the first transfer occurred prior to   4 the name of the grantee and relationship to the grantor do not appear on the face of the proposed certificate of survey  5 the grantee is also one 1 of the grantors b immediate family definition the montana subdivision and platting act defines immediate family as the spouse children by blood or adoption and parents of the grantor c filing requirements filing of any certificate of survey or recording of an instrument of conveyance that would use this exemption to create a parcel for conveyance to a family member must show the name of the grantee relationship to the landowner and the parcel to be conveyed under this exemption and the landowners certificate of compliance also the certificate of survey or instrument of conveyance shall be accompanied by a deed or other conveying document d family conveyance limitations one 1 conveyance of a parcel to each member of the landowners immediate family is eligible for exemption from subdivision review in accordance with the provisions contained herein however the use of this exemption may not create more than one 1 remaining parcel of less than one hundred sixty 160 acres e evasion determination any proposed use of family conveyance exemption to divide a tract that was created of an exemption will be presumed to be adopted for purposes of evading the act this presumption is in effect regardless of previous ownership of the tracts and pertains to remaining tracts of less than one hundred sixty 160 acres as well as to those tracts that were created exemptions f family conveyance and development plans the use of the family conveyance exemption to divide tracts that were created as part of an overall development plan with such characteristics as common roads utility easements restrictive covenants open space or common marketing or promotional plan shall constitute a rebuttable presumption that the use of the exemption is adopted for purposes of evading the act exemption to provide security for a construction mortgage lien or trust indenture see 7632011 mca a statement of intent under policies by many lending institutions and federal home loan guaranty programs a landowner who is buying a tract with financing or contract for deed is required to hold title to the specific site on which the residence will be built the intended purpose of this exemption is to allow a landowner that is buying a tract using financing or contract for deed to segregate a smaller parcel from the tract for security for financing construction of a home on the property b portion of parcel excluded from mortgage that portion of the parcel not included in the mortgage cannot be conveyed in any manner without subdivision review and approval by the governing body this exemption is not available to simply create a parcel without review by claiming that the parcel will be used for security to finance construction of a home or other structure on the proposed lot this exemption may not be properly invoked unless 1 the claimant is purchasing a larger tract or a contract for deed and thus does not hold title  and 2 a lending institution requires the landowner to hold title to a smaller parcel of the tract because the smaller tract is required as a security for a building construction loan c submittals required when this exemption is to be used the landowner shall submit to the cascade county clerk and recorder 1 a statement of how many parcels within the original tract will be created by use of the exemption  2 the deed trust indenture or mortgage for the exempt parcel which states that the tract of land is created only to secure a construction mortgage lien or trust indenture  3 a statement explaining who will have title to and possession of the balance of the original parcel after title to the exempted parcel is conveyed  and 4 a signed statement from a lending institution that the creation of the exempted parcel is necessary to provide security for mortgages liens or trust indentures for the purpose of construction improvements to the land being divided or refinancing purposes d evasion determination the use of this exemption is presumed to have been for the purpose of evading the act if 1 it will create more than one 1 building site  2 the financing is not for construction on the exempted parcel  3 the person named in the statement explaining who would have possession of the remainder parcel if title to the exempted parcel is conveyed is anyone other than the borrower of funds for construction  4 title to the exempted parcel will not be initially obtained by the lending institution if foreclosure occurs  or 5 it appears that the principal reason the parcel is being created is to create a building site and using the parcel to secure a construction loan is a secondary purpose e requirements and status of exempted parcel boundaries upon satisfaction of construction mortgage lien or trust indenture once the loan for construction mortgage lien or trust indenture has been satisfied the exemption is no longer applicable and the boundaries delineating the exempt parcel are extinguished and the acreage previously identified reverts back into the acreage of the initial parcel this will be accomplished by the filing of the warranty deed for the parent parcel when the conditions of the contract are satisfied in the event that the parcel is being purchased in that manner exemption for agricultural purposes see 7632071c mca a statement of intent the intention of this exemption is to allow a landowner to create a parcel without local review where the parcel will be used only for production of livestock or agricultural crops and where no residential commercial or industrial buildings will be built b agricultural purposes for purposes of these evasion criteria agricultural purposes means the use of land for raising crops or livestock or for the preservation of open space and specifically excludes residential structures or facilities for commercially processing agricultural products agricultural lands are exempt from review by the montana department of environmental quality provided the property owner properly invokes the applicable exemption c conditions to be met the following conditions must be met or the use of the exemption will be presumed to have been adopted for the purposes of evading the act 5 the parties to the transaction must enter into a covenant running with the land and revocable only by mutual consent of the city commission of the city of great falls and the property owner that the divided land will be used exclusively for agricultural purposes or open space the property owner the buyer or lessee and the city commission of the city of great falls or its designated agent must sign the covenant 6 the landowner must demonstrate that the planned use of the exempted parcel is for agricultural purposes and that no residential commercial or industrial buildings will be constructed  for example a statement signed by the buyer 7 any change in the use of the land for anything other than agricultural purposes subjects the parcel to review as a minor subdivision 8 residential commercial or industrial structures including facilities for commercial processing of agricultural products are excluded uses on parcels created under this exemption unless the covenant is revoked relocation of common boundary see 7632071a mca a statement of intent the intended purpose of this exemption is to allow a change of the location of a boundary line between two 2 parcels and to allow a onetime transfer of a tract to effect that change in location without subdivision review b boundary identification requirements certificates of survey claiming this exemption must clearly distinguish between the existing boundary location and the new boundary this shall be accomplished by representing the existing boundary with a dashed line and the new boundary with a solid line the appropriate certification must be included on the certificate of survey c deed required certificate of survey showing the relocation of common boundary lines must be accompanied by a deed or from adjoining property owners for the entire newly described parcels for that portion of the tracts that is being affected d additional parcel creation if the relocation of a common boundary would result in the permanent creation of an additional parcel of land the division of land must be reviewed as a subdivision e evasion determination a proposed relocation of common boundary lines may be considered an evasion of the act if it is determined that 1 the documentation submitted does not support the stated reason for relocation  or 2 it creates a parcel of less than one hundred sixty 160 acres in size which prior to the relocation had more than one hundred sixty 160 acres court order a certificate of survey filed citing this exemption must be accompanied by a copy of the court order see 763201 remainder parcels a statement of intent a remainder parcel is that part of an original tract that is left following the segregation of other parcels from the tract for the purpose of transfer a remainder may not be created for the purpose of conveyance and must be retained by the owner a remainder that is created by the segregation of a subdivision from a larger original tract is not part of the subdivision nor is it subject to the surveying requirements of the montana subdivision and platting act mspa although the term remainder does not appear in the mspa the possibility that remainder parcels may exist is implicit in the express provisions of the mspa attorney general letter opinion to robert mccarthy  b evidence of remainder status required a landowner claiming that a parcel is a
