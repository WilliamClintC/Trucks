editors note  adopted  set out provisions intended for use as div 4  2410124107 for purposes of classification and at the editors discretion these provisions have been included as div 4  2460124607   findings the city council of the city of warrensburg hereby finds and declares that 1 new growth results in new connections to the citys sewer system placing an increased demand upon sewer service facilities in excess of the sewer systems current capabilities in certain service areas throughout the city 2 the city continues to examine the additional sewer improvements that are needed to serve particular service areas in the city and has segregated projects and costs attributable to existing development and development in each service area 3 to the extent that development will place additional demand upon sewer system facilities that demand should be met by shifting the responsibility for financing such facilities from the general public to the developments creating the demand 4 the imposition of sewer improvement fees will help ensure that developments bear a proportionate share of the cost of sewer facilities necessary to accommodate developments in each service area 5 the sewer improvements necessary to accommodate development in a particular service area have a rational nexus to and provide benefit to development because the sewer improvements increase the supply and transmission capacity of the sewer system making service to development possible 6 in a public election regarding the issuance of sewer bonds the public expressed support for payments made by developments to pay for their proportionate share of sewer improvements 7 the council has considered the matter of financing sewer improvements the need for which is necessitated by development the council hereby finds and declares that a sewer improvement fee imposed upon development to finance sewer improvements in particular service areas the need for which is reasonably related to development furthers the public health safety and welfare of warrensburg therefore the council deems it advisable to adopt sewer improvement fees 8 the city assumes responsibility for and is committed to providing sewer service facilities necessary to serve existing connections mechanisms other than sewer improvement fees  51407  att 102317   purpose and intent a it is the intent of this division to impose a sewer improvement fee payable prior to the approval of a final plat in a particular service area in an amount based upon the land area of the proposed development b it is the intent of this division that by establishment of this system of calculating and imposing sewer improvement fees development in a particular service area will pay its pro rata share of reasonably anticipated costs of sewer service facilities required to serve the property where development is proposed and that the fees paid with respect to each development are roughly proportionate to the proposed development and the property being developed c it is the intent of this division to establish an appeal procedure to allow for an individualized determination that the sewer improvement fee imposed on each new connection is roughly proportionate to the demand that the new connection will place on sewer service facilities d it is the intent of this division that the sewer service facilities financed sewer improvement fees established hereby be based when applicable upon the citys comprehensive plan and capital improvement program e this division shall not be construed to authorize imposition of a sewer improvement fee for sewer service improvements attributable to existing development f it is the intent of this division to establish a sewer system users fee imposed upon development in a particular service area and not to levy a tax or fee as such term is used in of the missouri constitution g it is the intent of this division to establish a system of users fees as users fees are interpreted in missouri case law that will be used to pay for the cost of providing sewer service facilities the demand for which is generated by development the amount of the users fee to be paid by development is calculated to be proportionate to the land area occupied by such development in each service area this section is specifically designed so as not to establish a tax or fee as such terms are used in of the missouri constitution but rather as a mechanism to equitably shift the burden of the cost of such facilities from the existing general public which has already paid its fair share of the cost of the existing sewer system improvements and which will continue to pay for the cost of improvements to serve existing connections maintenance and repair other than those derived from this system of users fees to development that will generate the need for sewer service facilities that will be constructed with monies derived from this system of users fees the monies collected from imposition of this system of users fees are to be used to offset the cost of providing sewer service to development in the form of sewer service facilities the monies may not be paid into the citys general fund to defray customary governmental expenditures in addition the system is designed so that the users fee 1 is paid upon the approval of designated development applications and not periodically  2 is required to be expended for the provision of sewer facilities that directly benefit the land on which development is proposed within a reasonable period of time from the date such fee is paid  3 is directly proportional in amount to the sewer facilities provided  and 4 is for a service that has not been historically provided exclusively by monies derived from taxes  51407  att

northeast service area including the eastern portion of that service area which contains approximately four hundred twentyone 421 acres of developable area the east subdrainage basin of the northeast service area is the most cost efficient manner to provide sewerage service to that service area 2 in calculating the cost per acre of land in the east subdrainage basin of the northeast service area staff has accounted for and credited to each property other fees to be paid by all development in the service area 3 improvements in the east subdrainage basin of the northeast service area are needed to serve future development in that area that will result in increased demand upon sewer service facilities in excess of the sewer systems current capabilities 4 data estimates and calculations

located nonconforming lot a lot existing at the effective date of this chapter that does not meet the minimum area requirements or dimensional requirements of the district in which the lot is located nonconforming situation a situation that occurs when on the effective date of this chapter an existing lot or structure does not conform to one 1 or more of the regulations applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is located among other possibilities a nonconforming situation may arise because a lot does not meet minimum area requirements because structures exceed maximum height limitations because the relationship between existing buildings and the land in such matters as setback requirements is not in conformity with this chapter nonconforming use a nonconforming use occurs when property is used for a purpose or in a manner made unlawful by the use regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located a lawful use of a residential structure which is in existence at the time of passage of this chapter shall not be considered a nonconforming use so long as the existing use is not abandoned or discontinued if the existing use is thereafter abandoned or

conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use except that the lot is smaller than the required minimum dimensions set forth in the district regulations may be used for uses permitted in the regulations for the applicable zoning district in which the lot is located as though the lot contained the minimum dimensions required for use within that district 3 when the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects but the applicable setback requirements cannot be reasonably complied with then the permitissuing authority may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that a the property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such deviations  and b these deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot  and c the property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety 4 for purposes of subsection 3b above compliance with applicable building setback requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with such setback requirements however mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible d extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations and nonconforming uses 1 except as specifically provided for in this subsection no person may engage in any

original building 3 a nonconforming use of open land shall not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming 4 the intensity or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation or nonconforming use exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar

this chapter and all rights to continue the nonconforming situation or nonconforming use are terminated 2 if a building sustains such damage to the extent that the cost of repairs is less than seventyfive 75 percent of the fair market value of the building immediately prior to the damage it may be repaired or reconstructed and used as before the time of damage provided that such repairs or reconstruction are substantially completed within twelve 12 months of the date of such damage 3 for purposes of this section cost of repairs means the total estimated cost of all labor and materials

requirements of this chapter applicable to the proposed use can be complied with permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make initial use of a vacant lot 4 if all of the requirements of this chapter applicable to the proposed use cannot be reasonably complied with then the change is permissible if the permitissuing authority for that particular use issues a permit authorizing the change this permit may be issued if the permitissuing authority finds that a the intended change will not result in a violation of subsection c of this section  and b all of the applicable requirements of this chapter that can be reasonably complied with will be complied with mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting the requirements does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible in no event may an applicant be given permission to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would be created 5 once conformity with this chapter is achieved the property shall not revert to its nonconforming status g abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations 1 when a nonconforming use is discontinued for a continuous period of twelve 12 months whether or not any existing personal property or fixtures are removed the property thereafter shall be used only for uses permitted in the zoning district in which the property is located 2 if the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use is discontinued for a continuous period of twelve 12 months the property may thereafter be used only in conformity with a new zoning authorization or conditional use permit the conditional use permit may allow the property to be used for a conforming purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations and may only be issued if the permitissuing authority finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible the permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be corrected in order for the use to occur the permitissuing authority shall find that the proposed use will not be in violation of subsection d of this section before the permit is issued 3 for purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation or nonconforming use is lost pursuant to this section all of the buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole for example the failure to rent one 1 apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for twelve 12 months shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained but if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter 4 when a structure or operation made nonconforming by this chapter is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this chapter the twelvemonth period for purposes of this section begins to run on the effective date of this chapter h existence of a nonconforming use whether a nonconforming use exists shall be a question of fact and shall be decided by the board of adjustment after public notice and

used in conjunction with section 27200 table of permissible uses the following letter designations indicate the procedure required z means that the use is permissible in the indicated zone with a zoning permit issued by the zoning official c means a conditional use permit must be obtained from the city council ac means an adult use conditional use permit must be obtained from the city council pursuant to section 27119 of this b permissible uses and specific exclusions 1 the presumption established by this chapter is that the uses of land permissible within the city of warrensburg are listed in the table of permissible uses furthermore land uses which are permissible within each zoning district have similar impacts 2 uses of land that are not listed in the table of permissible uses are prohibited nor shall the table of permissible uses be interpreted to allow a use in one 1 zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another specified use that is permissible in other zoning districts 3 churches synagogues temples and similar places of worship including associated residential structures for religious personnel and associated buildings may be located in any zoning district 4 municipal properties including land buildings or premises owned rented or leased by the city of warrensburg are exempt from provisions of this ordinance while occupied or employed for public purposes in municipal rights obligations or pursuits but such city property which is rented or leased to private persons must comply with all applicable provisions of this title chapter c permissible uses not requiring permits notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter no zoning or conditional use permit is necessary for the following uses 1 streets 2 electric power telephone telegraph cable television gas water and sewer lines wires or pipes together with supporting poles or structures located within a public rightofway 3 neighborhood utility facilities located within a preexisting public rightofway d change in use 1 a substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character or nature of the activity conducted on the property changes this occurs whenever a the change involves a change from one principal use category to another b if there is only one 1 business or enterprise conducted on the lot that business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in even though the new business or enterprise may be classified under the same principal use category as the previous type of business i for example if there is only one 1 building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of that building moves out and is replaced by a clothing store that constitutes a change in use even though both tenants fall within principal use classification 211 however if the florist shop were replaced by another florist shop that would not constitute a change in use since the type of business or enterprise would not have changed ii if the florist shop moved out of a rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store that would not constitute a change in use since there is more than one 1 business on the lot and the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot shopping centercombination use has not changed 2 a mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice versa does not constitute a substantial change in use whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two 2 active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than three hundred sixtyfive 365 consecutive days or has been abandoned 3 a mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or change in the name shall not be regarded as a change in use e the most specific use classification controls whenever a use could fall within more than one 1 use classification in the table of permissible uses the classification that most closely and most specifically describes the use controls for example a small doctors office or clinic clearly falls within the  classification office and service operations conducted entirely indoors and designed to attract customers or clients to the premises however classification  office or clinics of physicians or dentists with not more than 10000 square feet of gross floor area more specifically covers this use and therefore is controlling  62292   101403 accessory uses a the table of permissible uses classifies different principal uses according to their different impacts a property lot or tract may have only one 1 principal use at a time whenever an activity which may or may not be separately listed as a principal use in this table is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use i constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on the property or ii is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use for example a restaurant is customarily associated with and integrally related to a hotel or motel and would be regarded as accessory to a hotelmotel use and thus allowed with a zoning permit in the bo district however if developed apart from a hotelmotel development public restaurant facilities would only be allowed in the bo business office district with a conditional use permit in no event shall two 2 primary unrelated uses occur upon any lot tract or property in any zoning district b for purposes of interpreting subsection a 1 a use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is secondary to the principal or primary use  is subordinate to the primary use  or is insubstantial in and of itself 2 to be commonly associated with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not but only that the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of the relationship of the two 2 uses c examples of uses and activities regarded as accessory to principal uses are specified in the district regulations d home occupations regulations governing home occupations in residential districts are presented in section 27203  62292   3909
