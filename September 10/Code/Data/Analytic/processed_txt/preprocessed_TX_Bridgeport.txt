safety section  as amended which is adopted and incorporated in this article by reference adopted   2001 sec  article 307 flood damage prevention division 1 generally authorization the legislature of the state has in the flood control and insurance act texas water section  delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council does ordain as follows adopted   2001 sec  of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage adopted   2001 sec  of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public     126435 4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area adopted   2001 sec  of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands adopted   2001 sec  unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application alluvial fan flooding flooding occurring on the surface

facilities charge if applicable as determined by the infrastructure services director will include the higher of the net book value or the replacement cost new of the citys facilities that are used to serve the consuming facility being switched as well as the easements for these facilities including the costs or a portion of the costs pertaining to common facilities that are used installed or designed to serve more than one consuming facility which are made idle as a result of the switchover request net book value is the original cost of facilities less any contributions in aid of construction that apply to those facilities less accumulated depreciation calculated using the depreciation rates that are currently used to book depreciation and less any salvage value net of any salvage costs replacement cost new shall be based upon the new cost of like facilities for which information is available plus the cost of acquiring easements for the facilities as if the easements were obtained at the time of the switchover requests the removed meter and removed drop line will not normally be considered idled facilities on the presumption that those can be used elsewhere on the citys electric system within a reasonable period of time but they may be included in those circumstances in which the city determines in the citys judgment and discretion they cannot reasonably be used elsewhere on the citys electric system within a reasonable period of time 3 to reasonably and conservatively protect the city from the financial loss that would arise from nonpayment of electric service charges that the customer may continue to incur for electric service from the city until the switchover is completed the customer must pay to the city in advance of the switchover a security deposit in the amount equal to the average monthly invoices rendered to the customer by the city for electric service during the preceding twelve months as calculated by the city in its judgment and discretion if an accounts existing security deposit exceeds the average monthly invoice amount no additional security deposit shall be made if the accounts existing security deposit does not equal the average monthly invoice amount the difference must be paid to the city in advance of the switchover 4 the calculation of switchover fees and security deposit may involve the making of estimates to the extent that there is a range of estimates for a particular calculation or calculation component the estimate shall be that which the city in its judgment and discretion determines is a reasonable estimate that fairly compensates and protects the city and fairly limits the fee paid by the customer to the costs to the city which the switchover creates on a costcausation basis 5 if in connection

for the idle facilities and the common facilities in question  and b in the case of a lease the rental shall be the amount that the city in its judgment and discretion determines is a fair market rental for the idle facilities and the common facilities in question in determining replacement cost new the city shall consider the new cost of like facilities for which information is available plus the cost of acquiring easements for the facilities as if the easements were obtained at the time of the switchover requests in the event of such a purchase or lease the idle facilities charge component of switchover fee calculation shall not include the purchased or leased idle andor common facilities the purchase or lease of any such idle andor common facilities shall be effected other documentation that the city in its judgment and discretion determines is reasonably necessary to effect such purchase or lease transactions and to reasonably effectuate the citys electric switchover policy including indemnifying the city from liability for the facilities after the purchase or lease of the facilities before a customer can purchase or lease the facilities it must prove to the city
