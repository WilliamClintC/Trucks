three  traffic six  general offenses seven  business regulation nine  streets and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen building fifteen  fire prevention s note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances  the comparative is included to show the disposition of every ordinance included in the codified ordinances it indicates whether a given ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more sections cross references direct the user to subject matter

safety and welfare by regulating the use of riparian areas that is those areas abutting rivers streams and other natural watercourses upon which the impacts of stormwater runoff water pollution erosion siltation and other development impacts may become concentrated and which areas are necessary to preserve the ecological health and natural functions of watercourses for the common good it is intended that these regulations administered in concert with other regulations affecting development practices throughout the city will benefit the properties which are within or which contain parts of riparian areas benefit the city as a whole and benefit areas outside of and downstream of the city which are affected by impacts on the citys riparian areas more specifically these regulations are intended to 1reduce flood impacts and downstream flood hazard risks by absorbing peak flows slowing velocity of flood waters and regulating base flow 2stabilize the banks of watercourses to reduce bank erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourse banks 3reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by filtering settling and transforming pollutants already present in watercourses 4reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering settling and transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses 5provide watercourse habitats with shade and food 6reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain a diverse aquatic system 7provide habitat to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian vegetation 8benefit the city by minimizing encroachment on watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering solutions such as dams retention basins gabion baskets and rip rap to protect structures and reduce property damage and threats to the safety of watershed residents  and by contributing to the scenic beauty and environment of the city and thereby preserving the character of the city the quality of life of the residents of the city and corresponding property values 9reduce or prevent construction of buildings and other construction in riparian areas which are characterized by conditions such as high groundwater flooding erosion and soil limitations which prohibit normal construction practices and require special protective measures for construction and longterm maintenance also reduce or prevent such construction which now or in the future may be damaged by flooding resulting from increased runoff due to upstream impacts 10minimize the creation of lots which are in whole or part difficult or impractical for the establishment of permitted uses within the respective districts due to the presence of riparian areas 11enable the city to more effectively execute its responsibilities in administration and enforcement of applicable federal and state regulations 12establish local regulations that are compatible with and supportive of the regulations enacted in other communities within the same watersheds in the interest of protecting and enhancing the characteristics of these shared natural resources bapplicability the provisions of this related this apply to all

to the receiving surface water of the state the discharge rate from the bmp will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate one of the following conditions 1the entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater  2the development will create less than one acre of impervious surface  3the development project is a redevelopment project with an ultraurban setting such as a downtown area or on a site where 100% of the project area is already impervious surface and the storm water discharge is directed into an existing storm water system  or 4the storm water drainage system of the development discharges directly into a larger river of fourth order or greater or to a lake and where the development area is less than five 5 percent of the water area upstream of the

24hour storm occurring on the same development drainage area under predevelopment conditions 2storms of less frequent occurrence longer return periods than the critical storm up to the 100year 24hour
