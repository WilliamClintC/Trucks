welfare the acquisition by the village of both properties which do and properties which do not contribute to the qualification of the area as blighted  and that in deteriorating areas the public welfare requires acquisition of properties which contribute to the qualification of the area as deteriorating in order to prevent deterioration into a blighted area but in deteriorating areas the village will not implement eminent domain for blight elimination for other properties  and ccontributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of crime and to losses by fire and accident
