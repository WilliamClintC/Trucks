specifications 961 findings  purpose athe city council finds and determines that the facilities now existing within the city are inadequate to carry off the water resulting from heavy rainfall or rapid snow melting which results in the flooding of some street intersections and other flooding problems it further finds that the likelihood of an overall construction of storm sewer and other facilities to handle the present surface water flows will be many years in the future if at all because of the tremendous cost thereof bit is further found and determined that it is for the best interests of the health and general welfare of the citizens of the city that interim steps be taken to minimize surface water runoffs and the flooding created thereby and that one way to achieve that goal is to require future developments within the city which generate additional runoff water to make provisions therefor within each development thereby not aggravating or increasing the already existing problem the requirement for holding reservoirs to delay the surface runoffs has already been required by the city for recent large construction projects and this to more clearly spell out the citys purpose and intent and the requirements to comply therewith 1979  962 chapter applicability included within the requirement for storm drainage and drainage structures and surface and storm drainage structures required by the subdivision title and other ordinances applicable to residential commercial and industrial development are the surface water control plans and structures provided for in this surface water controls are also applicable to and required of all school church residential commercial and industrial constructions repairs and additions including hard surfaced parking lots or other impervious areas in excess of ten thousand 10000 square feet and which in the determination of the public works director will generate substantial additional runoff water 1979   amd 1999  963 holding basins required each developer shall provide a holding basin or other suitable structure facility or land grading to delay the runoff of surface water from that development so that runoff will extend over a longer period of time and thereby reduce the amount of flooding which would otherwise result the size of the holding basin and the size of the outlet required and other engineering items are to be determined by the developer and the public works director upon recommendation of the city engineer using general engineering data applicable to this area concerning runoff water generated by the type of development proposed so that the new construction will not discharge onto adjacent streets or other land or into city storm sewer facilities surface water at a rate in excess of that discharged from that land prior to when the construction was made 1979   amd 1999  964 maintenance  developer responsibility aexcept in unusual circumstances and when agreed to by the mayor the construction operation maintenance and liability concerning those holding basins or reservoirs and other facilities constructed to control the surface water as required by this be the expense and responsibility of the developer and his or her successor in interest in the event the mayor determines the city should own the facility and have the responsibility of the operation maintenance and control thereof the facility shall be constructed by the developer and be conveyed to the city by deed or easement acceptable to the city bin the case of a dedicated residential subdivision the city shall assume responsibility for operation maintenance and control thereof when the retention facility is constructed by the developer in a manner acceptable to the city and conveyed to the city by warranty deed cin the event adequate facilities are in existence as determined by the public works director the developer may contribute money in lieu of and equal to the amount that would have been expended on such facilities and real property as may be found acceptable to the city 1979   amd 1999  965 plans and specifications the plans and specifications for any development conveyed by this show the details of the holding basin and other facilities and those structures shall be completed on or about the time any additional runoff water is generated by the construction involved 1979

the methods by which criminal street gangs establish control over identifiable areas is by loitering in those areas and intimidating others from entering those areas  3criminal street gangs establish control over identifiable areas in order to control narcotics sales and other illegal activities in those areas and to intimidate law abiding residents  4members of criminal street gangs avoid arrest by committing no offense punishable under existing laws when they know police are present while maintaining control over identifiable areas by continued loitering  5the city council has determined that loitering in public places by criminal street gang members creates a justifiable fear for the safety of persons and property in the area because of the violence including unacceptably high rates of drive by shootings drug dealing and vandalism often associated with such activity  6the city also has an interest in discouraging all persons from loitering in public places with criminal street gang members because persons who are not gang members in those circumstances are at risk from drive by shootings and other gang related violence and at risk to be recruited by gangs  7aggressive action is necessary to preserve the citys streets and other public places so that the public may use such places without fear  and 8current laws are inadequate to deal with problems posed by gang loitering principally because conventional laws generally depend upon the willingness of civilians to testify against gang members and drug dealers and many civilians are understandably reluctant to put themselves in harms way by providing such testimony bdefinitions as used in this section the following terms shall have the designated meanings criminal street gang any ongoing organization

the slm to become wet eg rain snow or condensation  or dwhen the ambient temperature is out of the range of the tolerance of the slm dthe report for each measurement shall include 1the date day of the week and times at which measurements are taken  2the times of calibration  3the weather conditions  4the identification of all monitoring equipment by manufacturer model number and serial number  5the

measurements to establish the approximate location and character of the principal sound source and to select suitable locations from which to measure the sound from the source in question fwhen measuring continuous sound or sound that is sustained for more than one second at a time the slm shall be set for aweighting slow meter response speed and the range if the slm is designed to read levels over different ranges of spls shall be set to that range in which the meter reads closest to the maximum end of the scale when the measured sound level is variable or fluctuating over a range greater than +3 dba using the slow meter response speed the fast meter response speed shall be used in either case both the minimum and maximum readings shall be recorded to indicate the range of monitored values gthe slm shall be placed at a minimum height of three feet 3 above the ground or from any reflective surface when handheld the microphone shall be held at arms length and pointed at the source at the angle recommended by the slm manufacturer hif extraneous sound sources such as aircraft flyovers or barking dogs that are unrelated to the measurements increase the monitored sound levels the measurements should be postponed until these extraneous sounds have become of such a level as not to increase the monitored sound levels of interest ithe monitoring session should last for

standards for consideration conditional uses are generally related to permitted uses but due to their unique characteristics or potential impacts on surrounding uses or the goals of the city may be appropriate only in certain locations and under specific conditions that mitigate potential impacts and may not be compatible in some areas as impacts cannot be mitigated conditional uses are intended to allow greater flexibility by providing a wider variety of uses in a zone while at the same time allowing conditions to be applied if conditions of mitigation or elimination of detrimental impacts would make the use compatible with surrounding or planned development  1572 conditional use permit aa conditional use permit shall be required for all uses listed as a conditional use in the

the property and development as proposed will improve the character of the area by encouraging reinvestment and upgrading of surrounding properties bgeneral plan consistency the proposed use at the particular location is consistent with the objectives and strategies established in the general plan particularly the community or corridor plans cuse compatibility the proposed use at the particular location is compatible with the character of the site adjacent properties surrounding neighborhoods and other existing development in determining the compatibility of the use with the surrounding area the planning commission may consider the following 1the type of use and its location does not create unusual pedestrian or vehicle traffic patterns or volumes that would not be expected with the development of a permitted use in determining unusual patterns the planning commission shall consider athe orientation of driveways and if they direct traffic to the major streets or the local streets and if directed to the local streets the impact it creates to the safety purpose and character of the local street  bparking locations and size and if they encourage street side parking and walking to the proposed use which impacts the adjacent land uses  and chours of peak land use when traffic to the use would be greatest and that such times and peaks would not impact the ability of the surrounding uses to enjoy the use of their property 2the hours of operation of the proposed use when compared with the hours of activity of the surrounding uses and the potential of such hours of operation do not create noise light or other nuisances not acceptable to the enjoyment of the existing surrounding uses or common to the surrounding uses ddesign compatibility the proposed site and building design and placement at the particular location is compatible with 1the character of the site in relationship with the surrounding uses which includes buildings and site uses integrating with the topography of the site retaining trees of value using natural features as site amenities developing landscaping along the public areas of the property to create an improved streetscape reducing expanses of large areas of asphalt or concrete and screening objectionable views that may exist on the site from all surrounding property owners  2the character of the area by the site design location of parking lots accessways delivery areas and on site vehicle circulation patterns taking into consideration the adjacent uses and not adversely impacting the adjacent use by exposing them to loss of privacy objectionable views of large parking or storage areas or views and sounds of loading and unloading areas  3the character of the surrounding uses by the type of exterior lighting and signage that will not detract by being bright or create unwanted light onto adjacent properties  4the architectural character of the community and the surrounding neighborhood considering the building materials colors roof shapes height mass size and orientation of the proposed building and design in determining compatibility with the architectural character of the community the design shall be

intent 15112 definition 15113 general regulations 15114 reduction of minimum street width 15115 review criteria 15116 plan submission 15111 purpose and intent the physical layout of the east central community and the r16 zones in the city reflect the typical patterns of early utah cities the typical ten 10 acre blocks were divided into one acre parcels and designed to accommodate food production subsequently these lots have been divided and redivided leaving an assortment of lots which have been bypassed by earlier development because of the lack of adequate access or other physical constraints this has resulted in vacant and underutilized lots in the center of many blocks some of which are not developable under the existing development regulations some of these vacant inner blocks have become a detriment to the surrounding neighborhoods because of the growth of weeds the collection of trash and by providing access for criminal activity for these reasons the purpose of this chapter is to encourage well designed residential development by recognizing the need to ease the constraints discouraging such development of vacant inner blocks this chapter is intended to help preserve the low intensity residential character of the neighborhood and provide additional housing options  15112 definition residential infill is the development of residential dwelling units on vacant or underutilized land located within the inner portion of a block which is otherwise generally developed around the periphery a residential infill development may include parcels of land on the periphery of the block only if these parcels are required to establish or improve access or are required to accomplish other design objectives necessary for a quality residential development as determined by the planning commission residential infill development is a conditional use and subject to the provisions of chapter 7 of this title  15113 general regulations aownership the land involved in a residential infill development shall be in one ownership or an application must be filed jointly by the owners of all the property to be included in the development bsubdivision title

development shall be compatible with the intent and policies established in the general plan dconditional use as a conditional use residential infill development shall be subject to the provisions of chapter 7 of this title  15114 reduction of minimum street width because of the historic development patterns which may have limited the possibility of access to the inner block the planning commission may approve the use of alleys within a residential infill development under section 1432 of this code if the planning commission determines that the use of residential infill alleys as public right of way is necessary for development and the following conditions are met apurpose of the use of residential infill alleys substantially meets the purpose of this chapter as described in section 15111 of this chapter  bhindering of services the reduction of the width of the public right of way does not hinder the provision of public services by the city or create situations which endanger the life or safety of residents  ccompliance with fire the reduction of the width of the public right of way shall comply with the requirements of the fire   dstandards the design of the

zone is intended to provide an incentive for developments that are willing to take advantage of the design regulations of this chapter there are two 2 review processes provided in the overlay zone an administrative review and a special exception review the special exception review is based on the size of the proposed development or the need for minor variations from this chapter which can only be approved by the planning commission bplans for development shall be submitted and reviewed according to chapter 4 of this title ccommercial or office development on lots larger than forty thousand 40000 square feet or multifamily residential development of more than thirty 30 units will be reviewed by the planning commission as a special exception review developments less than either of these two 2 standards will be reviewed administratively d1 when a plan is reviewed administratively it shall be reviewed for compliance with the regulations of this chapter and other applicable land use ordinances if the applicant seeks an exception to the standards for development for their project a request for an exception shall be applied for and a review with the planning commission will be scheduled for their next regular planning commission meeting in considering a request for an exception the planning commission shall review the request for acompliance with the vision strategies of section 16d of the general plan which is the 12th street corridor plan  bthe exception not having any negative impact to adjacent property owners  cthe exception maintaining the character of design and visual appearance of the surrounding uses  and dthe reason the exception is needed and if other alternatives are possible that would not require an exception 2if the commission finds the requested exception can comply with the first three 3 criteria and that there are not other options available then an exception can be granted if the commission finds the request does not meet the criteria then the exception shall be denied and the development must either comply with the regulation standards of this chapter or follow the regulations of the underlying zone e1 when a development plan is being reviewed by the planning commission as a special exception because the size of the development requires a special exception review the commission will review the proposal for compliance with athe regulations of this chapter and the other applicable land use regulations  bon and off site traffic patterns access and parking areas being located to reduce impacts to adjoining neighbors and potential traffic impacts and the ability to share accesses with adjoining properties or create secondary accesses  cdevelopment patterns not adversely impacting the use and privacy of the adjacent uses when they are singlefamily uses  and dresolving design issues of impact to adjacent properties which may need to be resolved on a case by case basis that the design regulations of this chapter may not have adequately addressed 2the purpose of the planning commission review when the review is based on the size of the development is to work out design issues of impact which larger developments may create on adjoining uses all adjoining property owners shall be notified of the proposed meeting to consider the proposed plan and its impacts the commission cannot deny the development if it complies with the regulations of this chapter but it can require additional site improvements or relocation of components of the site development in order to mitigate potential impacts of the design  chapter 26 floodplain overlay zone fp  purpose 15262 flood insurance study for ogden utah 15263 relationship of regulations to zoning use district 15264 definitions 15265

dependent upon location and type of project being developed the mu zone shall not be considered as a commercial or a manufacturing zone for the purpose of consideration of off premises signage location under state law   amd  15394 general development standards athe mixed use zone is intended to be applied in various locations in the downtown area or redevelopment districts to create a true mixed use the master plan and actual development of each location shall be in a manner that the design of the buildings parking land uses and landscaping create a compact development and quality design of building and spaces attention to the design is required to create a vibrant interactive and connected development both internally and to its surroundings the approved project master plan shall demonstrate that the project is developed paying attention to these standards as well as the development theme being proposed the development agreement and in redevelopment areas approval of each phase of the development will determine site specific details setbacks and building placements and use locations following the concepts of the approved project master plan which incorporates these standards in order to guide the development of the project master plan each project approval will be guided by the compliance to the following mixed use general development standards 1site design adowntown area 1setbacks buildings with ground level commercial uses should be located next to street property lines in order to create a street edge and give visual preference to pedestrian related access to the structures some variation for a portion of the building setback may be considered when outdoor spaces for the ground level use are developed such as outdoor dining or entrance features buildings with ground level residential use shall have a landscaped transition space from the street property line to the building of not greater than fifteen feet 15 which allows porches stairways or a common building entrance to create a transition area from the public sidewalk to the building all other side and rear setbacks will be determined based on potential impacts of noise service areas and objectionable views created by the service areas or use impacts other setbacks may be required by the planning commission when the design and the appropriate distance mitigation is needed along the perimeter of the development to transition from the mixed use to the surrounding developments 2compact design buildings in a mixed use design need to be clustered so that they are easily accessible for pedestrians and to shared parking areas clustering occurs by having the buildings tightly grouped along the street frontage or pedestrian access 3building orientation buildings shall be designed so that the front of the buildings are oriented to the street development projects with deep parcel depths that have buildings going into the property away from main streets shall also have the buildings placed on either side of a central plaza green space natural feature or walkway with the buildings fronting that walkway or plaza when space is limited it may be necessary to create a secondary entrance from the parking area to the building which faces the street 4parkingaccessservice areas parking lots shall be located in the central portions of the development and not along streets so that they can service a variety of buildings access to the parking areas should be directed to come from secondary streets when possible in order to create a continuity of buildings along the main street frontage surface parking lots shall be landscaped with islands which include trees to help unify the parking lot as a visual amenity to the development the separation of pedestrian access from vehicular traffic is an important design consideration service areas for buildings should be away from pedestrian accesses and public streets the use of alleys for service of residential parking access is encouraged bredevelopment districts outside downtown area 1setbacks the appropriate setback from the street will be determined based on the uses on either side of the development on the same side of the street the important consideration is maintaining the character of the existing streetscape massing and having building setbacks that respond appropriately to those characteristics all other side and rear setbacks will be determined based on potential impacts of noise height of structures service areas objectionable views created by the types of uses and the design and the appropriate mitigation needed along the perimeter of the development to transition from the mixed use to the surrounding developments 2compact design buildings in a mixed use design need to be clustered so that they are easily accessible for pedestrians and for easy access to shared parking areas compact designs create walking connections between buildings clustering occurs by grouping the buildings so that several buildings can be accessed from one parking area and from common pedestrian accessways 3building orientation buildings shall be designed so that the front of the buildings are to the street when central plazas or walkways are part of the design those central buildings shall front the central plaza green space natural features or walkway when space is limited it may be necessary to create a secondary entrance from the parking area to the building which faces the street 4parkingaccessservice areas parking lots shall be located to the side of buildings that front on a street or to the rear of the building areas so that they can service a variety of buildings in a clustered design concept rather than creating one large central parking area access to the parking areas should be directed to come from secondary streets when possible in order to create a continuity of the streetscape along the main street frontage when parking is to the side of a building it shall be set back from the face of the building a minimum of onethird 13 the depth of the building and the area in front of the parking shall be landscaped surface parking lots shall be landscaped with islands which include trees to help unify the parking lot as a visual amenity to the development the separation of pedestrian access from vehicle traffic is an important design consideration service areas for buildings should be away from pedestrian accesses and public streets the use of alleys for service access should be encouraged 2parking requirements adowntown area the parking requirements for the land uses shall be based on the requirements of section 15123 of this title and these shall be considered as maximum parking requirements shared parking reductions according to section 15127 of this title are encouraged with the exception of shared parking for residential dwelling units a minimum of one stall per dwelling unit is required unless a different standard is adopted in an architectural design book residential parking shall be designed into the dwelling unit if the design is townhomes detached dwellings or row houses multistory apartments or condos are encouraged to design the parking into the building as much as possible exceptions to reduce the residential parking requirement below the minimum requirement such as shared vehicles mass transit system connections or other means can be considered nonresidential parking may also consider parking on the public street as meeting the developments parking requirement bredevelopment districts outside downtown area the parking requirements for the land uses shall be based on the requirements of section 15123 of this title and these shall be considered as the maximum parking requirements shared parking reductions according to section 15127 of this title are encouraged with the exception of shared parking for residential dwelling units a minimum of one and onehalf 112 stalls per dwelling unit is required unless a different standard is adopted in an architectural design book residential parking shall be designed into the dwelling unit if the design is townhomes detached dwellings or row houses multistory apartments or condos are encouraged to design the parking into the building as much as possible exceptions to reduce the residential parking requirement below the minimum requirement such as shared vehicles mass transit system connections or other means can be considered 3building design amultilevel mixed use buildings are encouraged to promote architectural quality in building design that a mixed use development needs visual interest is an important requirement in the building designs visual interest is created by but not limited to the following features 1the building design has a visually distinct base body and cap these are generally achieved by means of the ground level being the base the body being the middle portion of the building and the cap being the cornice 2upper story elements balconies windows terraces that overlook the street plaza and other pedestrian walkways 3the perceived height and bulk of the building is relieved by variation in massing and articulation of facades to reduce the visual length of long walls variation of rooflines may also be used to reduce the apparent size of mixed use buildings and provide visual interest 4building heights vary in the development to create visual relief and the building height transitions from taller buildings to lower heights to achieve compatibility with adjacent properties when the adjacent properties have a one or twostory maximum height limitation if the adjacent zone does not have a height limit the taller buildings of the mixed use project shall be located on street corners major street frontages or as focal points in the development bquality of the development is related to the choice of exterior materials used in a mixed use project brick atlas brick or stone shall be the main exterior solid surface building materials on the first level of a building as a minimum and preferably as the main solid surface material for all the building exterior simulated materials that provide a similar visual appearance may also be considered above the first floor trims and accent materials may be stucco architectural metals wood or wood appearing materials if the mixed use project has an architectural design book for architectural styles building types design details and material approved with the master plan that design book will determine the design materials and all other specified requirements for buildings acceptable for the project cuses which are nonresidential at the ground level shall 1have the primary frontages of the building either face a street plaza or pedestrian accessway depending where the primary building frontage is located 2have the primary frontage designed with a minimum of seventy percent 70% in transparent glass to create storefront appearances and a transparency between the building and the pedestrian traffic 3have a floor to ceiling height on the ground level between twelve feet 12 and sixteen feet 16 dall sides of the buildings shall receive equal design consideration when they are visible to the pedestrian access areas and the general street system or the building rises above other buildings and is visible from all sides 4open space the project master plan shall include an open space element that defines the objectives desired with open space and how open space will be established throughout the development in approving the open space element of the master plan the planning commission shall consider how the usable open space shall be provided within the mixed use development with the amount and type of open space depending upon size scale and nature of the development approved open space may include but is not limited to commons pocket parks plazas courtyards landscape features water fountains and features greenbelts and trail connections the design shall encourage comfortable and safe pedestrian use including landscaping seating areas and lighting as appropriate as well as connections to public access such as connections to trail systems and water features unless otherwise specified agreement or understanding with the city all open space areas shall be maintained by property owners or homeowners associations 5signage proper signage design in a mixed use development is important to the overall theme of the development and sign locations need to be part of the design of the project abusiness signs are limited to flat wall mounted signs and projecting signs designed at a pedestrian scale between 10 feet and 14 feet above the sidewalk placed on the storefronts and are the typical sign method that will be considered as appropriate except that building names development names and directional signage are also permitted if they integrate into the building or theme design of the development bdevelopments outside of the downtown area may be allowed one freestanding monument tenant sign not to exceed eight feet 8 in height for each street frontage provided the monument sign is constructed of the same materials as the adjacent buildings in the development and that the sign fits in context with the development cother sign types may be used when allowed by a section of this chapter governing a particular mixed use zone 6application to existing buildings awhen a mixed use zone is applied on property outside of a redevelopment district plan area the project master plan may include the use of all or portions of existing buildings provided there is also new construction on the site in connection with the existing building which create a compact mixed use development following the general development standards if existing buildings comply with the mixed use building design standards the new construction shall be designed to integrate its design and materials with the existing buildings when existing buildings do not meet the standards outlined in this section then revisions to the exterior of the existing buildings to create an integrated mixed use development are required as part of the mu zoning consideration bwhen the mixed use zoning is applied to a redevelopment district plan area the existing buildings may not be reused if they are deemed a blight by the redevelopment plan or if such reuse of the building hinders the attainment of the overall project master plan by noncompliance with the general development standards and the redevelopment plan  15395 project master plan requirements aone of the key requirements in consideration of a request for the mixed use zone is a project master
