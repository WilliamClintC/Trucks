sexually oriented businesses the findings are based upon the experiences of other cities where such businesses have located and upon the report of the attorney generals working group on regulation of sexually oriented businesses dated  prepared by hubert h humphrey iii attorney general of the state the report the report considered evidence from studies conducted in various cities throughout the country relating to sexually oriented businesses 1 the report concluded that sexually oriented businesses are associated with high crime rates and depression of property values in addition the character of a neighborhood can dramatically change when there is a concentration of sexually oriented businesses adjacent to residential property 2 sexually oriented businesses have an impact on the neighborhoods surrounding them that is distinct from the impact caused by other commercial uses 3 residential neighborhoods located within close proximity to adult theaters bookstores and other sexually oriented businesses experience increased crime rates sexrelated crimes in particular lowered property values increased transiency and decreased stability of ownership 4 the adverse impacts which sexually oriented businesses have on surrounding areas diminish as the distance from the sexually oriented businesses increases 5 studies of other cities have shown that among the crimes which tend to increase either within or in the near vicinity of sexually oriented businesses are rapes prostitution child molestation indecent exposure and other lewd and lascivious behavior 6 the phoenix arizona study confirmed that the sex crime rate was on the average 500 percent higher in areas with sexually oriented businesses 7 many members of the public perceive areas within which sexually oriented businesses are located as less safe than other areas that do not have such uses 8 studies of other cities have shown that the values of both commercial and residential properties either are diminished or fail to appreciate at the rate of other comparable properties when located in proximity to sexually oriented businesses 9 the indianapolis indiana study established that professional real estate appraisers believe that an adult bookstore would have a negative effect on the value of both residential and commercial properties within a one to threeblock area of the store 10 the suburban characteristics of the city are similar to those of the cities cited by the report when considering the effects of sexually oriented businesses and that the findings concerning the effects of sexually oriented businesses in other cities documented in the report are relevant to potential circumstances in the city 11 sexually oriented businesses have the potential for adverse secondary effects upon certain preexisting land uses within the city and that in studies documented in the report it is not necessary for the city to conduct its own independent study concerning the effects of sexually oriented businesses locating within the city 12 the city is currently without an ordinance regulating sexually oriented businesses within the city 13 the united states supreme court in city of renton v playtime theaters inc 106 s ct 925 1988 and others has made it clear that a total prohibition against sexually oriented businesses would be unconstitutional 14 the location of sexually oriented businesses within the city will have a potentially detrimental effect on the city by unnecessarily lowering property values within the city if said establishments were located in inappropriate areas 15 there will be the risk of increased crime within the city from inadequate regulations of sexually oriented businesses locating and operating within the city 16 contentneutral time place and manner restrictions that regulate the licensing of sexually oriented businesses are necessary in the city to minimize the potential adverse secondary effects which will accompany the location and operation of said businesses within the city but that said regulations should be drafted in such a manner as to allow for reasonable opportunity to open and operate sexually oriented businesses within the city while minimizing the secondary adverse effects 01 conclusions in direct furtherance of the substantial goals of public health safety and welfare the city council adopts the licensing regulations in this article recognizing that it has a great interest in the promotion of health and the prevention of criminal activity 03 definitions the following words terms and phrases

to be used by vehicles that are not authorized emergency vehicles under any circumstances b definitions as used in this section the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them traffic signal preemption system or tsps a traffic control system designed for use by authorized emergency vehicles to improve traffic movement by temporarily controlling signalized intersections the tsps is comprised of four separate components an emitter a detector an indicator and a phase selector the emitter a highintensity light source is attached to the authorized emergency vehicle and functions like a strobe light pulsating at a frequency in excess of ten beats per second as an authorized emergency vehicle approaches the intersection a detector that is located at or near the traffic signal receives this pulsating light the detector relays the coded message to the phase selector located in the traffic light control box which then either holds the existing green light in favor of the approaching authorized emergency vehicle or accelerates the normal cycle of a signal change to provide green by the time the vehicle reaches the intersection the indicator is a light source located near the detector that is directed toward the oncoming authorized emergency vehicle to indicate to the driver whether or not the traffic signal has been preempted in favor of the authorized emergency vehicle c conditions for use conditions for use of the tsps are as follows 1 authorized emergency vehicles shall use the tsps while on emergency responses only all other uses of the tsps by authorized emergency vehicles are prohibited 2 unless specifically approved herein it shall be unlawful for any person to activate the tsps in the city by any means whatsoever installation of tsps emitters on any vehicle not an authorized emergency vehicle are prohibited d procedures for operating procedures for operating the tsps are as follows 1 when the tsps is being used by an authorized emergency vehicle responding to an emergency situation standard light and siren operation should be followed in accordance with police or fire department policy as the case may be 2 when the tsps is being used in an emergency situation where the use of sirens is not appropriate standard emergency light operations should still be used increased caution and reduced speeds particularly at intersections are then required 3 emergency personnel must be aware that the tsps may fail to provide rightofway at all signalized intersections due to the following a the intersection may not be tspsequipped  b one or more tsps components may be inoperative  c speed of the authorized emergency vehicle may cause the authorized emergency vehicle to arrive at the intersection too soon for the tsps to cycle the signal to green  d another authorized emergency vehicle using tsps may be coming from a crossflow direction and may already have seized command of the intersection signal  e severe weather conditions may disrupt the detection of the emitted signal thereby preventing the tsps from recognizing the signal preemption request  or f other conditions may exist which prevent the tsps from operating as designed 4 upon reaching the emergency destination the tsps emitter shall be turned off immediately to ensure that it does not inadvertently seize control of surrounding signalized intersections 5 whenever the tsps appears not to be functioning properly it is the emergency vehicle drivers responsibility to immediately report the defect and the location of the defective signal to the chief of

denied by resolution of the city council d standards for approving a conditional use permit  the planning commission shall make the following affirmative determinations before a conditional use permit may be recommended for approval by the city council 1 that the conditional use with such conditions as the commission shall determine and attach conforms to the general purpose and intent of this chapter 2 if the application is based on the conditional use provision in this chapter that the issuance conforms to the general characteristics of the district of which it will become a part 3 that the conditional use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of property in the neighborhood for uses permitted in the district or districts affected 4 that adequate utilities access roads streets drainage and other necessary facilities have been or will be provided 5 that adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress in such a manner as to minimize traffic congestion and hazards in the public streets 6 in residential districts certain uses may not be considered appropriate within the interior of residential neighborhoods because of noise traffic or other conditions that would tend to adversely affect the residential character of the neighborhood and possibly reduce property values these may be considered appropriate only on the periphery of residential neighborhoods or under such conditions as the city council may deem proper the uses may represent buffer uses for those areas lying between residential dwellings and nonresidential uses 7 in consideration of an application the following standards shall apply a business districts  certain uses are considered as a rule unsuitable in commercial areas because of inherent characteristics eg traffic hazards noise light glare proximity to residential areas the fact that they tend not to serve nearby residential areas or may adversely affect nearby permitted business uses b industrial districts  certain uses may be considered generally unsuitable in industrial districts because of conditions that would tend to discourage other industrial development in the vicinity  these conditions may include noise vibrations dust glare unsightliness or similar nuisances certain other industrial land uses are considered generally inappropriate because they represent underutilization of land which in turn means a low tax return from land that under fuller development would be contributing needed revenue to the citys tax base c temporary uses in all zoning districts  certain uses that are generally not suitable within a particular zoning district may be potentially suitable on a temporary basis this may be due to the lack of development of existing property a shortterm need or a limited degree of adverse effects upon adjacent land use e conditions  the city may attach such reasonable conditions to the granting of a conditional use permit as it shall determine necessary or desirable to bring it within the purpose and intent of this chapter f termination  the violation of any condition in the grant of the conditional use permit
