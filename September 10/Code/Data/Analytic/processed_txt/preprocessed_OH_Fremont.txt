linda f swartz                 clerk   s terry overmyer               mayor historical data when fremont became a city editors note the following historical note was discovered in one of the old city ordinance books its author was basil meek attorney who acted at various times in the past century as clerk of courts of sandusky county and as city postmaster and as a member of the school board on  at a meeting of the village council a resolution offered by col haynes then a member was adopted providing for certification to the governor the auditor and secretary of state of the fact that fremont had a population exceeding five thousand inhabitants which fact had been established by a recent enumeration the resolution also provided that such state officers were to be requested to declare the village a city of the second class on  at a meeting of the village council a document was entered in the journal of the council in the following words whereas in accordance with the provisions of the statutes in such cases made and provided satisfactory evidence has been furnished to the undersigned authorities that the incorporated village of fremont sandusky county ohio has a population exceeding five thousand inhabitants and has trustees certified its desire to accept the advancement to the grade of the city of the second class therefore by virtue of the power conferred upon us by said statute we do declare the incorporated village of fremont to have become a city of the second class in testimony whereof we have hereunto affixed our official signatures and caused the great seal of the state of ohio to be affixed at columbus this 18th day of july ad 1866  jd cox governor  jh godman auditor of state  wm henry smith y of state on  at a council meeting an ordinance to perfect the organization of the city with respect to wards and election districts and dividing the city into wards was introduced by col haynes and passed the following division was made first wardall west of the sandusky river and south of the center line of croghan street second wardall west of the sandusky river and north of the center line of croghan street third wardall east of the sandusky river                                                         on  the first meeting of the council as the city council of fremont was held the venerable john bell was mayor and it is an interesting fact that he was the first mayor of the village of lower sandusky which was organized in 1829 the members of the first city council were called trustees  they were david belts and plate brush from the first ward  ambrose ochs and tm quilter from the second ward  and jd botefur and thomas kelley from the third ward the council was organized by the election of jc botefur president and dr f wilmer clerk thus it appears that fremont became in law a city on   basil meek attorney   contents preliminary unit  comparative tables of special ordinances codified ordinances of fremont ohio  part one  administrative

                            editors note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position   enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at
