sign design guidelines 1 general guidelines the signs design should complement the design of its host building or site and the overall character of the business district signs should be designed and painted by professional sign makers or experienced artists each sign should be designed in accordance with the following standards 2 appearance signs should be compatible with their surroundings in collingswoods central business district zones signs should match traditional early and mid twentieth century sign patterns ie flushmounted wall signs  window signs  awning signs  projecting and icon signs  and murals small freestanding signs which are usually displayed on the lawn in front of a former dwelling are more appropriate in the professional office district zones all of these signs also would be compatible with the highway streetscape in the highway business district and highway industrial district zones as well as pylons signs and illuminated signs signs for businesses in a common building shopping office or industrial center should be compatible with each other too signs that relate to and complement their surroundings will capture the attention of a pedestrian or motorist better than a poorly designed one which may give a negative impression of the business and the community as a whole signs attached to the same building should be the same shape color and height regardless of individual business ownership or tenancy in the building 3 materials highquality materials will ensure that a sign will look attractive reduce maintenance costs and last longer sign materials and finished textures should complement the building materials permanent signs should be made of wood highdensity foam simulating wood mediumdensity overlay and finished plywood brass copper or bronze generally signs made of inferior grade unfinished wood and plastic are inappropriate and discouraged cotton vinyl and mixed fabrics should be used for awning signs plastic and lexan materials should be used for internally illuminated signs 4 placement many buildings have spaces that are specifically designed for signs such as the area below the second floor  141101 collingswood code  141101  windowsill or on a building or sign fascia signs should be integrated with the building without obscuring important architectural details or storefront windows signs should be mounted so as to minimize damage to historic materials sign supports should be finished with architectural details to complement the sign such as ornamental iron or brass supports and routed wood posts and edges to provide detail and relief window and door signs should avoid cluttering and blocking views this will help increase customer interest and business visibility viability and safety 5 lettering lettering and character typefaces should match the scale of the building and size of the sign signs should be legible from a typical viewing position and travel speeds for example lettering in the central business district zone should be visible to pedestrians and slower moving traffic signs along highway corridors may have lettering that is legible from quicker moving traffic inappropriate typefaces have characters that are difficult to read and incompatibly styled for their host building site or district while cursive style typefaces may be appropriate for pedestrianoriented signs they would be difficult to read in an automobileoriented business zone hardtoread faddish and intricate typefaces should be avoided 6 color colors influence a signs legibility character and general appearance the colors should be compatible with the style and color scheme of the building and its neighbors color schemes should be kept simple limited to two or three colors and based on a host buildings painted exterior detailing such as window trim and cornices earth tones primary colors and pastels are appropriate and can be designed with subtle combinations and variations fluorescent luminescent and iridescent colors and tones should only be used for traffic safety signs signs with a strong color contrast are more legible a sign with a dark background will make lighter lettering more visible because storefront windows usually appear dark window signs should be done in light colored paint or gold leaf 7 lighting collingswood encourages the use of decorative light fixtures such as gooseneck hooded historic reproduction and alcove fixtures complimentary to the design of building sign or site direct external illumination should be used in all districts internally illuminated signs however are appropriate in the highway business district and highway industrial district zones neon lights should be used only in the central business district zones on buildings where it was used as a primary signage element before 1960 or on modern buildings with compatible architectural styling as determined by the historic preservation commission signs should be evenly lit with no isolated bright or dark spots no  141101 condominium conversion  141101  substantial light or glare may be directed or reflected onto adjacent streets or properties c zoning district design standards

address these harms and leave open ample alternative venues for political fundraising  whereas our laws in new jersey do not presently recognize the misuse of public property for political fundraising as a district offense  therefore it is accordingly found and determined that the municipalitys interest in an independent and efficient government workforce and a government that is undermined by
