the city a number of these rental units may from time to time be substandard or in violation of the new york state uniform fire prevention and building the new york state multiple residence law or other state codes or local codes the city council finds that the large number of rental units encourages a transient population which often accounts for a disproportionate number of complaints of public nuisances including but not limited to noise disorderly conduct and property damage the city council also finds that identifying and contacting a responsible party to address code violations nuisance calls and emergencies associated with residential rental properties is frequently a challenge for city staff because contact information for the owner or hisher agent is not routinely

this chapter shall be known as the stormwater management and erosion control   7952 findings of fact the city of canandaigua finds that uncontrolled drainage and runoff associated with land development has a significant impact upon the health safety and welfare of the community specifically a the citys stormwater drainage system is currently stressed during heavy rain events causing flooding in multiple locations b land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition c this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including nutrients pathogens and siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species d clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat e improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation f impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow g substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality h stormwater runoff soil erosion phosphorus loading and other nonpoint source pollutants can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities i the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion phosphorus loading and other nonpoint source pollutants associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public

organized as so as to be capable of satisfactory use and operation as a separate entity without necessarily needing the participation of other building sites or other common property in order to function as a neighborhood this article specifically encourages innovations in residential development so that the growing demands for housing at all economic levels may be met by greater variety in type design and siting dwellings and by the conversion and more efficient use of land in such developments 2 this article recognizes that while the standard zoning function use and bulk and the subdivision function platting and design are appropriate for the regulation of land use in areas or neighborhoods that are already substantially developed these controls represent a type of preregulation regulatory rigidity and uniformity which may be inimical to the techniques of land development contained in the planned unit development concept further this article recognizes that a rigid set of space requirements along with bulk and use specifications would frustrate the application of this concept b objectives in order to carry out the intent of this article a pud shall achieve
