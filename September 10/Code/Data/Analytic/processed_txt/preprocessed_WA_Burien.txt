that it should be the purpose or effect of this chapter to impose a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexuallyoriented materials similarly it is not the intent of the city that it should be the effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexuallyoriented materials protected by the state or federal constitutions or to deny access by

testimony of law enforcement officers and members of the public and on other evidence information publications articles studies documents case law and material submitted to and reviewed and considered by the city council and staff the councils of other cities within the region and in other jurisdictions nonprofit organizations and other legislative bodies the city council makes the following findings 1certain conduct occurring on premises offering sexuallyoriented business creates secondary impacts that are detrimental to the public health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and therefore such conduct must be regulated as provided herein 2regulation of the sexuallyoriented business industry or licensing is necessary because in the absence of such regulation significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred 3proximity between entertainers and patrons during adult entertainment performances can facilitate sexual contact prostitution and related crimes concerns about crime and public sexual activity are legitimate and compelling concerns of the city which demand reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments in order to protect the public health safety and general welfare 4it is necessary to license entertainers in the sexuallyoriented industry to prevent the exploitation of minors to ensure that each such entertainer is an adult and to ensure that such entertainers have not assumed a false name which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible 5the evidence supporting the need to protect minors and families from the criminal and other unlawful activities associated with the operation of sexuallyoriented businesses is compelling the provisions of this chapter are necessary to ensure that sexuallyoriented uses in burien are conducted a reasonable distance away from places where minors regularly gather often in large numbers 6it is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of sexuallyoriented businesses at such times as such establishments are offering sexuallyoriented business so there will at all necessary times be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the establishment including the actions of patrons entertainers and other employees 7the license fees required herein are nominal fees imposed as necessary cost recoupment measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the city in regulating the sexuallyoriented businesses and in increased police costs in enforcement 8enterprises providing sexuallyoriented businesses are increasingly associated with ongoing prostitution disruptive conduct and other criminal activity such businesses are currently not subject to effective regulation and constitute an immediate threat to the public peace health and safety the hours of operation of such businesses have a significant impact on the occurrence of illegal drug transactions and other criminal activities 9due to the information presented regarding the connection of prostitution with sexuallyoriented businesses there is concern over sexuallytransmitted diseases which is a legitimate health concern of the city and thus requires regulation of sexuallyoriented businesses in order to protect the health safety and wellbeing of the public 10many cities including seattle and tacoma have experienced negative secondary impacts from sexuallyoriented business land uses the skid row effect is one of these secondary impacts and is evident in certain parts of seattle such an effect would be significantly magnified in burien due to the difference in size and characteristics of the city 11the city of burien may rely on the experiences and studies of other cities counties and organizations in assessing the need for regulation of sexuallyoriented business uses operations and licensing 12the city takes notice of studies and experiences of other cities and counties in combating the specific adverse impacts of sexuallyoriented businesses 13regulation of sexuallyoriented businesses should be developed to prevent deterioration andor degradation of the vitality of the community before the problem exists rather than in response to an existing problem 14increased levels of criminal activities occur in the vicinity of sexuallyoriented businesses additionally hidden ownership interests for the purpose of skimming profits avoiding payment of taxes and racketeering have historically occurred in sexuallyoriented businesses in the absence of regulations 15the city council therefore finds that the protection and the preservation of the public health safety and welfare requires establishment of this chapter 16there are sufficient important and substantial government interests to provide a constitutional basis for reasonable regulation of time place and manner under which sexuallyoriented businesses can operate 17police officers in the city of seatac have conducted numerous investigations at the city of seatacs existing adult entertainment establishment these investigations conducted by both uniformed officers and undercover officers have resulted in the issuance of numerous citations for criminal violations a majority of the violations involved physical contact between an entertainer and a patron 18it is not the intent of this chapter to unconstitutionally suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment of the united states constitution nor of the washington state constitution but to enact contentneutral ordinances which address the secondary effects of sexuallyoriented businesses as well as the health problems associated with such businesses 19in a family community sexuallyoriented businesses are not uniformly compatible with community standards as defined during the numerous public hearings 20the law enforcement resources available for responding to problems associated with or created by sexuallyoriented businesses are limited and are best conserved by regulating and licensing sexuallyoriented businesses and those associated with them 21in order to assure that all conditions regulations etc are met the city has established a reasonable time period for review of license applications  2000  definitions 1adult cabaret means any commercial premises including any cabaret premises to which any member

including sexuallyoriented materials similarly it is not the intent of the city that it should be the effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexuallyoriented materials protected by the state or federal constitutions or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexuallyoriented material to their intended market neither is it the intent of the city that it should be the purpose or effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials  2000  findings based upon a wide range of evidence presented to the burien city council and to other jurisdictions including but not limited to the testimony of law enforcement officers and members of the public and on other evidence information publications articles studies documents case law and material submitted to and reviewed and considered by the city council and staff the councils of other cities within the region and in other jurisdictions nonprofit organizations and other legislative bodies the city council makes the following findings 1certain conduct occurring on premises offering sexuallyoriented business creates secondary impacts that are detrimental to the public health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and therefore such conduct must be regulated as provided herein 2regulation of the sexuallyoriented business industry or licensing is necessary because in the absence of such regulation significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred 3the evidence supporting the need to protect minors and families from the criminal and other unlawful activities associated with the operation of sexuallyoriented businesses is compelling the provisions of this chapter are necessary to ensure that sexuallyoriented uses in burien are conducted a reasonable distance away from places where minors regularly gather often in large numbers 4it is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of sexuallyoriented businesses at such times as such establishments are offering sexuallyoriented business so there will at all necessary times be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the establishment including the actions of patrons entertainers and other employees 5the license fees required herein are nominal fees imposed as necessary cost recoupment measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the city in regulating the sexuallyoriented businesses and in increased police costs in enforcement 6enterprises providing sexuallyoriented businesses are increasingly associated with ongoing prostitution disruptive conduct and other criminal activity such businesses are currently not subject to effective regulation and constitute an immediate threat to the public peace health and safety the hours of operation of such businesses have a significant impact on the occurrence of illegal drug transactions and other criminal activities 7due to the information presented regarding the connection of prostitution with sexuallyoriented businesses there is concern over sexuallytransmitted diseases which is a legitimate health concern of the city and thus requires regulation of sexuallyoriented businesses in order to protect the health safety and wellbeing of the public 8many cities including seattle and tacoma have experienced negative secondary impacts from sexuallyoriented business land uses the skid row effect is one of these secondary impacts and is evident in certain parts of seattle such an effect would be significantly magnified in burien due to the difference in size and characteristics of the city 9the city of burien may rely on the experiences and studies of other cities counties and organizations in assessing the need for regulation of sexuallyoriented business uses operations and licensing 10the city takes notice of studies and experiences of other cities and counties in combating the specific adverse impacts of sexuallyoriented businesses 11regulation of sexuallyoriented businesses should be developed to prevent deterioration andor degradation of the vitality of the community before the problem exists rather than in response to an existing problem 12increased levels of criminal activities occur in the vicinity of sexuallyoriented businesses additionally hidden ownership interests for the purpose of skimming profits avoiding payment of taxes and racketeering have historically occurred in sexuallyoriented businesses in the absence of regulations 13the city council therefore finds that the protection and the preservation of the public health safety and welfare requires establishment of this chapter 14there are sufficient important and substantial government interests to provide a constitutional basis for reasonable regulation of time place and manner under which sexuallyoriented businesses can operate 15it is not the intent of this chapter to unconstitutionally suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment of the united states constitution nor of the washington state constitution but to enact contentneutral ordinances which address the secondary effects of sexuallyoriented businesses as well as the health problems associated with such businesses 16the law enforcement resources available for responding to problems associated with or created by sexuallyoriented businesses are limited and are best conserved by regulating and licensing sexuallyoriented businesses and those associated with them 17in order to assure that all conditions regulations etc are met the city has established a reasonable time period for review of license applications  2000  definitions as used in this chapter the following words and phrases shall have the

liability on the part of the city of burien or its officers employees or agents for any injury or damage resulting from the failure of any person to comply with this chapter   findings the following findings of fact were adopted by the king county board of health in kcc the city council of the city of burien hereby adopts the same findings as set forth below 1head injuries are a major cause of death and disability associated with the operation of a bicycle on public roadways and bike paths every year approximately 1000 americans die of bicyclerelated injuries approximately 75 percent of those deaths are due to head injuries a significant number of those individuals who survive head injuries do not return to a normal life they are often left with profound disabling and longlasting conditions from 1989 there were 35 bicyclerelated deaths and 2003 bicyclerelated hospitalizations in king county including seattle 2bicycle helmets have been shown to prevent head injuries suffered by bicycle riders during a crash or fall studies completed in 1989 and 1996 by investigators at group health cooperative of puget sound and the harborview injury prevention and research center show that helmet use could reduce the number of head injuries involving bicycling by between 69 percent and 85 percent the medical examiner noted that of the eight bicyclerelated deaths in 200 four were not wearing helmets moreover the king county child death review cdr found that of the five children who died while riding a bicycle from july 1998 to april 200 four were not wearing helmets when injured  the cdr experts concluded that three of the children would have likely survived if a helmet had been worn finally using tools developed by the centers for disease control and prevention it is estimated that nearly $10000000 would be saved annually in both direct and indirect costs for bicyclerelated head injuries in king county if every cyclist would wear a helmet 3educational and promotional efforts in king county have increased helmet use from two percent in 1985 to 61 percent in 1999 for children ages five in 199 bicycle helmet use in adults was observed to be 71 percent however these results have reached a plateau additional efforts are needed to augment helmet use 4studies in the united states and elsewhere demonstrate that legislation is effective in increasing helmet use helmet laws in georgia maryland and new york increased helmet use from between 26 percent and 40 percent in north carolina helmet use increased two to three times after legislation furthermore new zealand found a 30 percent reduction in head injuries after passage of a helmet law thus regulations requiring the use of bicycle helmets enhance the effectiveness of educational efforts to reduce the number and severity of head injuries resulting from bicycle crashes the city council of the city of burien therefore finds that bicycle helmets are required for the safe operation of bicycles not powered by motor on public roadways bicycle paths or any rightofway or publicly owned facility located in the city of burien   definitions 1bicycle means every device

chapter will be carried out 2the surface water management program created by this chapter shall be administered by the director pursuant to interlocal agreement king county and its department of public works is designated as the citys agent for providing drainage services under this program to the residents and property owners of the city and for the purpose of collecting surface water service charges from city property owners a copy of the interlocal agreement shall be available in the office of the city clerk for use and examination by the public 3whenever necessary to examine the property characteristics of a particular parcel for the purposes of implementing this chapter the director may enter any property or portion thereof at reasonable times in compliance with the following procedures aif the property or portion thereof is occupied the director shall present identification credentials state the reason for entry and request entry bif the property or portion thereof is unoccupied the director shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of the property or portion thereof and request entry and cunless entry is consented to by the owner or person in control of any property or portion thereof the director before entry shall obtain a search warrant as authorized by the laws of the state of washington 4the director is authorized to enforce this chapter the ordinances and resolutions codified in it and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder pursuant to the enforcement and penalty provisions of of this chapter 5the program may provide services related to surface and stormwater management including but not limited to basin planning facilities maintenance regulation financial administration public involvement drainage investigation and enforcement aquatic resource restoration surface and stormwater quality and environmental monitoring natural surface water drainage system planning intergovernmental relations and facility design and construction the program may contract for services with interested municipalities or special districts including but not limited to sewer and water districts school districts port districts or other governmental agencies   purpose it is the finding of the city that the surface water management program is necessary in order to promote public health safety and welfare by establishing and operating a comprehensive approach to surface and stormwater problems which would reduce flooding erosion and sedimentation prevent and mitigate habitat loss enhance groundwater recharge and prevent water quality degradation it is the finding of the city that the most costeffective and beneficial approach to surface and stormwater management is actions and protection of the natural drainage system in approaching surface and stormwater problems the program shall give priority to methods which provide protection or enhancement of the natural surface water drainage system over means which primarily involve construction of new drainage facilities or systems the purpose of the rates and charges established herein is to provide a method for payment of all or any part of the cost and expense of surface and stormwater management services these rates and charges are necessary in order to promote the public health safety and welfare by minimizing uncontrolled surface and stormwater erosion and water pollution to preserve and utilize the many values of the citys natural drainage system including water quality open space fish and wildlife habitat recreation education urban separation and drainage facilities and to provide for the comprehensive management and administration of surface and stormwater   applicability developed parcels within the service area shall be billed each year for surface and stormwater management services pursuant to rcw    policy 1it is the finding of the city that developed parcels contribute to an increase in surface and stormwater runoff to the surface and stormwater management system this increase in surface and stormwater runoff results in the need to establish rates and charges to finance the citys activities in surface and stormwater management developed parcels shall be subject to the rates and charges of the program based on their contribution to increased runoff the factors to be used to determine the degree of increased surface and stormwater runoff to the surface and stormwater management system from a particular parcel shall be the percentage of impervious surface coverage on the parcel the total acreage of the parcel and any mitigating factors as determined by the city 2it is the finding of the city that undeveloped parcels do not contribute as much as developed parcels to an increase in surface and stormwater runoff into the surface and stormwater management system undeveloped properties shall be exempt from the rates and charges of the program 3it is the finding of the city that maintained drainage facilities mitigate the increased runoff contribution of developed parcels by providing onsite drainage control parcels served by flow control facilities which were required for development of the parcel or can be demonstrated by the property owner to provide flow control of surface and stormwater to the standards in this chapter shall receive a discount as provided in the rates and charges of the program if the facility is maintained at the parcel owners expense to the standard established by the department 4it is the finding of the city that improvements to the quality of surface water runoff can decrease the impact of that runoff on the environment parcels served by water quality treatment facilities that were required for development of the parcel or that can be demonstrated by the property owner to provide treatment of surface and stormwater to the standards in this chapter shall receive a discount as provided in the rates and charges of the surface and stormwater management program if the facility is maintained at the parcel owners expense to the standard established by the department 5it is a finding of the city that open space properties provide a benefit to the surface and stormwater management system by the retention of property in an undeveloped state open space properties shall receive a discount from the rates and charges to encourage the retention of property as open space 6the majority of the parcels in the service area are residential the variance between residential parcels in impervious surface coverage is found to be minor and to reflect only minor differences in increased runoff contributions the administrative cost of calculating the service charge individually for each residential parcel and maintaining accurate information would be very high a flat charge for residential parcels is less costly to administer than calculating a separate charge for each parcel and is equitable because of the similarities in impervious surface coverage between residential parcels therefore residential parcels shall be charged a flat charge based upon an average amount of impervious surface 7very lightly developed nonresidential parcels which have an impervious surface coverage of 10 percent or less of the total parcel acreage are characterized by a very low intensity of development and generally a large number of acres a greater number of acres of undeveloped land associated with an impervious surface results in significantly less impact to the surface and stormwater management system these parcels shall be charged a flat rate which will encourage the retention of large areas of very lightly developed land 8lightly to very heavily developed nonresidential parcels which have an impervious surface coverage of more than 10 percent have a substantial impact on the surface and stormwater management system the impact of these parcels on the surface and stormwater management system increases with the size of the parcels therefore lightly to very heavily developed properties shall be charged a rate determined by the percent of impervious surface coverage multiplied by the parcel acreage 9the city roads and state highway programs provide substantial annual programs for the construction and maintenance of drainage facilities and the road systems and their associated drainage facilities serve as an integral part of the surface and stormwater management system city and state road drainage systems unlike the drainage systems on other properties are continually being upgraded to increase both conveyance capacity and control it is envisioned that the roads program will work cooperatively with the surface and stormwater management program to improve regional surface and stormwater management services as new information is available from basin plans and other sources city roads and state highways shall not be charged a rate in recognition of the benefit to the surface and stormwater management services provided by the drainage facilities associated with the city roads and state highway programs provided that those drainage facilities are constructed operated and maintained in accordance with this chapter 10comprehensive management of surface and stormwater runoff must include anticipation of future growth and development in the design and improvement of the surface and stormwater management system service charge revenue needs shall be based upon the present and future requirements of the surface and stormwater management system and these needs shall be considered when determining the rates and charges of the program 11basin plans are essential to establishing a comprehensive approach to a capital improvement program maintenance of facilities and regulation of new developments a plan should analyze the measures needed to control surface and stormwater runoff which results from existing and anticipated development within the basin the measures investigated to control runoff should include land use regulation such as setback requirements or community plan revisions which revise land use densities as well as the use of drainage facilities a plan also should recommend the quantity and water quality runoff control measures required to further the purposes set forth in this chapter and community goals the institutional requirements and regulations including but not limited to land use management funding needs and incentives for preserving the natural surface and stormwater drainage system should be identified in the plan the proposed ordinances and regulations necessary to implement the plan shall be transmitted to the council simultaneously with the plan 12areas with development related surface and stormwater problems require comprehensive management of surface and stormwater 13additional surface and stormwater runoff problems may be caused by new land use development if not properly mitigated both of natural systems and improvements the swdm and the sppm and this chapter have been adopted to mitigate the impact of land use development further mitigation of these impacts is based on expertise which continues to evolve as new information on our natural systems is obtained and new techniques are discovered the program studies basin plans and other special studies will continuously provide valuable information on the existing problems and areas of the natural drainage system that need special protection the city is researching and developing methods to protect the natural drainage system buffering and setbacks to alleviate existing problems setback and buffering measures allow natural preservation of wetlands and stream corridors to occur alleviate erosion and water pollution and provide a safe environment for the small mammals and fish which inhabit sensitive areas based upon the findings in this subsection and as information and methods become available the director as appropriate shall draft and submit to the council regulations and development standards to allow protection of the surface and stormwater management system including natural drainage systems 14the program will maintain longterm fiscal viability and fund solvency for all of its related funds the programs approach to financial reporting and disclosure will be comprehensive open and accessible 15the program shall prepare an annual multiyear capital improvement program which encompasses all of the programs activities related to the acquisition construction replacement or renovation of capital facilities or equipment all proposed new facilities will be subject to a consistent and rigorous needs analysis the programs capital facilities will be planned and financed to ensure that the benefits of the facilities and the costs for them are balanced over time   rate structure revised 120 1the service charges shall be based on the relative contribution of increased surface and stormwater runoff from a given parcel to the surface and stormwater management system the percentage of impervious surfaces on the parcel the total parcel acreage and any mitigating factors as provided in this chapter will be used to indicate the relative contribution of increased surface and stormwater runoff from the parcel to the surface and stormwater management system the relative contribution of increased surface and stormwater runoff from each parcel will determine that parcels share of the service charge revenue needs the service charge revenue needs of the program are based upon all or any part as determined by the council of the cost of surface and stormwater management services or to pay or secure the payment of all or any portion of any issue of general obligation or revenue bonds issued for that purpose 2the department shall determine the service charge for each parcel within the service area by the following methodology aresidential and very lightly developed nonresidential parcels shall receive a flat rate service charge for the reasons set forth in this chapter blight to very heavily developed parcels shall be classified into the appropriate rate category by their percentage of impervious surface coverage land use codes or data collected from parcel investigations or both will be used to determine each parcels percentage of impervious surface coverage after a parcel has been assigned to the appropriate rate category the service charge for the parcel will be calculated by multiplying the total acreage of the parcel times the rate for that category 3there are hereby imposed upon all developed properties in the service area annual service charges as follows surface water management service charges class impervious

number of mobile home spaces 4the city council will review the surface water management service charges annually to ensure the longterm fiscal viability of the program and to guarantee that debt covenants are met the program will use equitable and efficient methods to determine service charges           rate adjustments and appeals revised 120 1any person billed for service charges may file a request for rate adjustment with the department within three years of the date from which the bill was sent however filing of such a request does not extend the period for payment of the charge 2requests for rate adjustment may be granted or approved by the director only when one of the following conditions exists athe parcel is owned and is the personal residence of a person or persons

follows i for residential uses it is the number of dwelling units for which a building permit application has been made and ii for office retail or manufacturing uses it is the gross floor area of buildings to be used for each use expressed in square feet divided by 1000 square feet or in the units defined in the schedules busing the formula in subsection 3 of this section transportation impact fees shall be calculated separately for each use the transportation impact fees that shall be paid are the sum of these calculations cif a development activity will include more than one use in a

purposes and administrative provisions  user guide this chapter establishes regulations pertaining to the development within or adjacent to critical areas many areas of burien have been or may become classified as critical areas by the city or other public agencies the following critical areas are found in the city of burien and regulated under this chapter afrequently flooded areas bmc   bgeologically hazardous areas bmc  including ierosion hazard areas iilandslide hazard areas and iiiseismic hazard areas  cwetlands bmc   dstreams bmc   efish and wildlife habitat conservation areas bmc   and fcritical aquifer recharge areas bmc      purposes and goals 1the city finds that critical areas provide a variety of valuable and beneficial biological and physical functions that benefit the city and its residents andor may pose a threat to human safety or to public and private property the beneficial functions and values of critical areas include but are not limited to water quality protection and enhancement fish and wildlife habitat food chain support flood storage conveyance and attenuation of storm runoff groundwater recharge and discharge wave attenuation aesthetic value protection and recreation hazards include landslides flooding and excessive erosion 2this chapter is to be administered with flexibility and attention to sitespecific characteristics it is not the intent of this chapter to make a parcel of property unusable by denying its owner reasonable use of the property 3purposes the purposes of this chapter are to aimplement the goals policies guidelines and requirements of the washington state environmental policy act c rcw growth management act a rcw and the city of burien comprehensive plan which call for protection of the natural environment and the public health safety and welfare and allowing for appropriate urban development within the regions urban growth area bdesignate classify and regulate the use of critical areas in accordance with the growth management act and application of best available science as determined according to wac 365195900 as amended and in consultation with state and federal agencies and other qualified professionals 4goals by regulating development and alteration of critical areas and their buffers this chapter seeks to apreserve and enhance the ecological value of critical areas to maintain the functional integrity of the natural environment  bprotect public health safety and welfare by minimizing adverse impacts and risks associated with development in critical areas  cpreserve the quality of life in burien  dminimize public and private expenditures to correct future misuses of critical areas  eprovide city officials with sufficient information direction and authority to identify and if necessary regulate development of critical areas  mitigate impacts on critical areas and enforce critical area regulations and permit conditions  fencourage flexibility and creativity in the development of property containing or adjacent to critical areas to meet the requirements and goals of this chapter while preserving property rights  and geducate the community about the hazards risks functions and value of buriens critical areas and the responsibility of the city to protect and preserve the natural environment for future generations     relationship to other regulations 1greater

apply unless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter or unless such provision conflicts with federal or state laws or regulations 2multiple buffers when more than one critical area affects a site and multiple buffers are required all required buffers must be provided unless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter where buffers overlap the most restrictive buffer applies 3compliance with the provisions of this chapter does not constitute compliance with other federal state and local regulations and permit requirements that may be required the applicant is responsible for complying with these requirements apart from the process established in this chapter     applicability 1compliance required alteration development use andor activities proposed within or adjacent to critical areas and their required buffers shall comply with the provisions of this chapter critical areas and their required buffers shall not be altered except as allowed by this chapter 2identification and classification of critical areas the director shall identify and classify critical areas as follows acritical areas map the locations of many critical areas in burien are displayed on the city of buriens critical areas map which is hereby adopted by reference this map is used to alert the public of the potential location of critical areas in burien as new environmental information related to critical areas becomes available the director is hereby designated to periodically make such changes as necessary to the critical areas map bactual site conditions regardless of whether a critical area is shown on the critical areas map the actual presence or absence of the features defined in this code as critical areas shall govern the director may require the applicant to submit technical information to indicate whether critical areas actually exist on or adjacent to the applicants site based on the definitions of critical areas in this code 3adjacency for the purposes of this chapter land is adjacent to a critical area if it is aland that contains the required critical area buffer width and building setback  bland within one hundred 100 feet upland from a stream or lake  cland within three hundred 300 feet of a wetland  dland within 660 feet of a bald eagle nest  eland within two hundred 200 feet of a designated critical aquifer recharge area  or fland within the floodway or floodplain       protection of critical areas any action taken pursuant to this chapter shall result in equivalent or greater functions and value of the critical areas associated with the proposed action as determined by the best available science all actions and developments shall be designed and constructed in accordance with mitigation sequencing bmc  to achieve no net loss of critical area functions and values applicants must first demonstrate an inability to avoid or reduce impacts before restoration and compensation of impacts will be allowed no activity or use shall be allowed that results in a net loss of the functions or value of critical areas     best available science 1criteria for best available science the best available science is that scientific information applicable to the critical area prepared by local state or federal natural resource agencies a qualified scientific professional or team of qualified scientific professionals that is consistent with criteria established in wac 365195900 as amended 2protection for functions and value and anadromous fish critical area studies and decisions to alter critical areas shall rely on the best available science to protect the functions and value of critical areas and must give special consideration to conservation or protection measures necessary to preserve or enhance anadromous fish and their habitat such as salmon and bull trout 3absence of valid scientific information where there is an absence of valid scientific information or incomplete scientific information relating to a critical area leading to uncertainty about the risk to critical area function of permitting an alteration of or impact to the critical area the director shall take a precautionary approach that strictly limits development and land use activities until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved     exemptions and exceptions 1exemption request and review process exemptions shall be reviewed in conjunction with an associated approval such as a land use decision or the issuance of a construction permit absent associated permits or approvals the proponent of the activity may submit a written request for exemption to the director that describes the activity and states the exemption in this section that applies the request shall be processed as an administrative decision if the exemption is approved it shall be placed on file with the department if the exemption is denied the proponent may continue in the review process and shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter the director may add conditions for exemption to ensure the level of activity remains consistent with the provisions of this chapter 2avoid or limit impacts all exempt activities shall use cityapproved best management practices and other reasonable methods to reasonably minimize impact to critical areas and their required buffers to be exempt from this chapter does not give permission to degrade a critical area or ignore risk from natural hazards the director may require submittal of a critical area study pursuant to bmc  needed to assess public safety risks associated with the proposal restoration of nonexempted alterations or damage to a critical area or its buffer may be required 3exempt activities the following shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter  however the activities listed

shoreline jurisdiction components of burien shoreline master program amendments and state role  overview of state shoreline management act the state of washington shoreline management act rcw was passed by the legislature in 1971 and adopted by the public in a 1972 referendum the following is an excerpt from the shoreline management act stating washington states policy regarding shorelines complete text of rcw  the legislature finds that the shorelines of the state are among the most valuable and fragile of its natural resources and that there is great concern throughout the state relating to their utilization protection restoration and preservation in addition it finds that ever increasing pressures of additional uses are being placed on the shorelines necessitating increased coordination in the management and development of the shorelines of the state the legislature further finds that much of the shorelines of the state and the uplands adjacent thereto are in private ownership  that unrestricted construction on the privately owned or publicly owned shorelines of the state is not in the best public interest  and therefore coordinated planning is necessary in order to protect the public interest associated with the shorelines of the state while at the same time recognizing and protecting private property rights consistent with the public interest there is therefor a clear and urgent demand for a planned rational and concerted effort jointly performed by federal state and local governments to prevent the inherent harm in an uncoordinated and piecemeal development of the states shorelines it is the policy of the state to provide for the management of the shorelines of the state by planning for and fostering all reasonable and appropriate uses this policy is designed to insure the development of these shorelines in a manner which while allowing for limited reduction of rights of the public in the navigable waters will promote and enhance the public interest this policy contemplates protecting against adverse effects to the public health the land and its vegetation and wildlife and the waters of the state and their aquatic life while protecting generally public rights of navigation and corollary rights incidental thereto the legislature declares that the interest of all of the people shall be paramount in the management of shorelines of statewide significance the department in adopting guidelines for shorelines of statewide significance and local government in developing master programs for shorelines of statewide significance shall give preference to uses in the following order of preference which 1recognize and protect the statewide interest over local interest  2preserve the natural character of the shoreline  3result in long term over short term benefit  4protect the resources and ecology of the shoreline  5increase public access to publicly owned areas of the shorelines  6increase recreational opportunities for the public in the shoreline  7provide for any other element as defined in rcw  deemed appropriate or necessary in the implementation of this policy the publics opportunity to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of natural shorelines of the state shall be preserved to the greatest extent feasible consistent with the overall best interest of the state and the people generally to this end uses shall be preferred which are consistent with control of pollution and prevention of damage to the natural environment or are unique to or dependent upon use of the states

structures ports shoreline recreational uses including but not limited to parks marinas piers and other improvements facilitating public access to shorelines of the state industrial and commercial developments which are particularly dependent on their location on or use of the shorelines of the state and other development that will provide an opportunity for substantial numbers of the people to enjoy the shorelines of the state alterations of the natural condition of the shorelines and shorelands of the state shall be recognized by the department shorelines and shorelands of the state shall be appropriately classified and these classifications shall be revised when circumstances warrant regardless of whether the change in circumstances occurs made causes or natural causes any areas resulting from alterations of the natural condition of the shorelines and shorelands of the state no longer meeting the definition of shorelines of the state shall not be subject to the provisions of chapter 9058 rcw permitted uses in the shorelines of the state shall be designed and conducted in a manner to minimize insofar as practical any resultant damage to the ecology and environment of the shoreline area and any interference with the publics use of the water in 199 the legislature amended the growth management act gma and the shoreline management act sma to partially integrate the two statutes the amendments incorporated the goals and policies of the sma as the fourteenth goal of the gma specifically designating the goals and policies of a local shoreline master program as a
