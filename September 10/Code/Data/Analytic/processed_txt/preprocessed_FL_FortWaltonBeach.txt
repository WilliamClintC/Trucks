order including de minimis situations 1 the requirement for a certificate of concurrency shall not apply to properties listed on the national register of historic places or the florida master site file 2 where multiple development permits are required the issuance of the certificate of concurrency shall occur prior to the issuance of the initial local development permit b a certificate of concurrency shall be issued upon a finding that the determination of concurrency demonstrates the availability of capacity to serve the proposed development 1 the certificate of concurrency shall include the condition that facilities with the required capacity shall be in place and available to serve new development or as otherwise provided in state law 2 for potable water the certificate of concurrency shall include the condition that prior to approval of a building permit the city shall determine that adequate water supplies to serve the new development will be available no later than the anticipated date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy c a certificate of concurrency shall automatically expire simultaneously with the expiration of the local development permit to which it applies if a time extension is granted prior to the expiration of a local development permit then the accompanying certificate of concurrency shall be automatically extended for the length of the time extension d a certificate of concurrency shall be issued in writing and signed by the development administrator   determination of concurrency a determination of concurrency is a demonstration that the proposed impact on the specified public services and facilities does not exceed the capacity based on the minimum level of service standard a level of service standards 1 the minimum level of service standard for potable water is 125 gallons of potable water per person per day 2 the minimum level of service standard for wastewater is 115 gallons of wastewater per person per day 3 the minimum level of service standard for solid waste is six and eighttenths 68 pounds per person per day 4 the minimum level of service standard for recreation is four and thirtytwo onehundredths 432 acres of recreation land per 1000 people 5 the minimum level of service standard for stormwater runoff quantity is to retain the first one 1 inch on site and ensure that the postdevelopment runoff rate does not exceed the predevelopment runoff rate for a twentyfive 25 year twentyfour 24 hour storm event the minimum level of service standard for stormwater runoff quality shall be as set forth in fac 6 the minimum level of service standard for arterial and collector roads outside the adopted transportation concurrency exception area tcea is d there is no minimum level of service standard within the tcea however proposed development within the tcea shall provide facilities that improve mobility based on the requirements set forth in  the minimum level of service for public schools is 100 percent of the capacity established by the department of education for schools serving the city b the concurrency calculation and determination shall compare the available capacity of each required facility or service to the demand of the proposed development 1 the required facilities to meet the level of service standard for stormwater runoff shall be determined by the calculation of stormwater impacts as set forth in the engineering standards manual of fort walton beach 2 the available capacity for the transportation system shall be determined by the provision of a transportation or traffic study as set forth in b 3 the available capacity of all remaining facilities and services with an adopted level of service standard shall be calculated as follows a establishing the capacity of the facility or service  b subtracting the capacity used by existing development  c subtracting the capacity committed to approved developments of certificates of concurrency  and d yielding the amount of capacity remaining and available to serve proposed development c the available capacity may be adjusted based on planned expansions to capacity that guarantee an increase in capacity prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the proposed development d the required capacity may be established in an approved development agreement in compliance with the requirements in de minimis projects a generally 1 a proposed development may be determined to have a de minimis impact on one 1 or more facilities and services with an adopted level of service standard as set forth in  a proposed development with a de minimis impact shall be exempt from any further concurrency determination b the following situations are considered de minimis for all facilities and services with an adopted level of service standard 1 a singlefamily dwelling 2 a nonresidential structure with fewer than 1500 square feet of total floor area and generating fewer than fifty 50 trips per day 3 a building addition with fewer than 1500 square feet of total floor area and generating fewer than fifty 50 trips per day c any proposed development or redevelopment with an impact of not more than one 1 percent of the maximum volume at the adopted level of service of the affected transportation facilities as determined by the city utilizing the most recent table of the generated twoway peak hour volumes in the florida department of transportation fdot level of service handbook shall be considered de minimis regarding the transportation level of service no impact shall be deemed to be de minimis if the sum of existing roadway volumes from approved projects on a transportation facility would exceed 110 percent of the maximum volume at the adopted level of service of the affected transportation facility or if the impact would exceed the adopted level of service standard for any affected designated hurricane evacuation route   strategies to rectify a lack of concurrency where available capacity cannot be demonstrated and a certificate of concurrency has been denied the following methods may be used to maintain adopted level of service a the applicant may provide the necessary improvements to maintain level of service in such case the application shall include appropriate plans for improvements documentation that such improvements are designed to provide the capacity necessary to achieve or maintain the level of service as required in recordable instruments guaranteeing the construction consistent with determination of concurrency as set forth in b the proposed project may be altered such that the projected level of service is no less than the adopted level of service c the construction of any development project may be phased or staged so as to coincide with the phased or staged construction of infrastructure facilities so that the levels of service for such facilities are maintained upon completion of each phase or stage
