time of adoption of see ch 1 general provisions art i licensing and regulation of businesses adopted 9141998 by   779 purpose and findings purpose pursuant to the authority granted in the second class township prohibit nuisances  to promote the health cleanliness comfort and safety of the citizens of uwchlan township  and to regulate the time of opening and closing and the conduct of places of public entertainment amusement and recreation the township of uwchlan enacts this article to minimize and control the adverse effects of adult entertainment business uses also referred to hereinafter occasionally as adult entertainment businesses and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of its citizens  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of blight the board of supervisors has determined that locational criteria alone can not adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of the people of the township and that licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult entertainment businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do  township of uwchlan pa ecode360  35620 3  1 a b c d e f g h i 2 b not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation the board of supervisors does not intend this article to suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment but to enact a contentneutral article which addresses the secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses findings the board of supervisors finds and it adopts by reference the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses presented in hearings and in reports and adopted as part of township enacted  editors note is included in the township zoning finding noted in 1 above raises substantial governmental concerns as do the following legislative findings adult entertainment businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the adult entertainment businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the adult entertainment business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the township it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult entertainment business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters requiring licensees of adult entertainment businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the dayto day operation and maintenance of the adult entertainment business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity the fact that an applicant for a license to operate an adult entertainment business has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this article the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the township will be promoted by the

and development throughout a watershed increases flooding flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces infiltration and groundwater recharge increases nonpoint source pollution to waterways and threatens public health and safety  township of uwchlan pa ecode360  220620 b c d e f g h a b c d e f inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance and development throughout a watershed can harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge a comprehensive program of stormwater management including minimization of impacts of new development redevelopment and other earth disturbance activities causing accelerated runoff and erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety and general welfare of the people of the municipality and all of the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment stormwater is an important water resource that provides infiltration and groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by reducing the volume of stormwater generated and by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality infiltration stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems costeffective and environmentally sensitive stormwater management can be achieved use of nonstructural site design techniques that minimize impervious surfaces reduce disturbance of land and natural resources avoid sensitive areas ie riparian buffers floodplains steep slopes wetlands etc and consider topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential

cases including without limitation any case in which it is established to the satisfaction of the board that an effect of the zoning regulation at issue or challenged is to deprive the landowner of a property or other right guaranteed or protected by the commonwealth of pennsylvania or united states constitutions  and further provided the following findings are made where relevant in a given case that there are unique physical circumstances or conditions including irregularity narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the zoning the neighborhood or district in which the property is located that because of such physical circumstances or conditions there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property that such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant subsequent to the adoption of this ordinance or prior ordinances whether in violation of the provisions hereof or not and that such circumstances or conditions are such that strict application of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of such land structure or building that for reasons fully set forth in the findings of the board the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building and that the variance as granted by the board is the minimum variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue that the variance if authorized will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property nor be detrimental to the public welfare  township of uwchlan pa ecode360  596620 6 7 8 9  b c 1 2 3 4 5 6 a 9035 that any variance granted shall be subject to such conditions as will assure that the adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and district in which the subject property is situated nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property that no nonconforming use of neighboring lands structures or buildings in the same district and no permitted or nonconforming use of land structure or building in other districts shall be considered grounds for the granting of a variance that in no case shall a variance be granted solely for reasons of additional financial gain on the part of the applicant that the jurisdiction of the board of supervisors shall not be infringed upon
