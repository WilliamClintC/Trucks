determined by an appraisal by a member of the appraisal institute mai of the american institute of real estate appraisers and certified by the state of illinois of the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and recreation sites the subdivider or developer shall submit an mai appraisal at the developers expense showing the fair market value of the land upon the final plat of subdivision thereof being recorded the final determination of said fair market value per acre of such subdivided land shall be made by the village board based upon such information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other similar appraisals which may be submitted to the village board by the park district or others b criteria for requiring dedication and a fee there will be situations in subdivisions or planned developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary these occasions will arise when 1 only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location of a park site that portion of the land within the subdivision falling within the park location shall be a dedicated site as required by this section and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have to be dedicated 2 a major part of the local park or recreation site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site the remaining portions shall be required by dedication and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required 5 reservation of additional land where the comprehensive plan of hanover park or the standards of the village call for a larger amount of park and recreational land or school sites and particular subdivision or planned development than the developer is required to dedicate the land needed beyond the developers contribution shall be reserved for

relief as may be appropriate l upset 1 for the purposes of this section upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with village pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user an upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation 2 an industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that a an upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the causes of the upset  b the facility was being operated at the time in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  c the industrial user has submitted the following information to the village and the treatment plant operator within 24hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information was provided verbally a written submission must be provided within five days 1 a description of the indirect discharge and cause of the noncompliance 2 the period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or if not connected the anticipated time noncompliance is expected to continue 3 steps

the burden of proof 4 industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with village pretreatment standards 5 the industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with village pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its pretreatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails m generalspecific prohibitions an industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with article iv if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge along with or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1 a village limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 2 no village limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements n test of good faith effort when determining an appropriate enforcement response to an incident of noncompliance the village will consider the apparent attitude of the user towards the effort required to achieve and maintain compliance with the ordinance if a user appears to be acting in good faith to comply with the ordinance the village may choose an enforcement action on a more conciliatory level that if a user does not appear to be acting in good faith to comply with the ordinance for the purpose of establishing a good faith effort on part of the user the village will measure the users effort against the following standard as stated in legislative history of the clean water act no 9514 vol 3 p463 the act requires industry to take extraordinary efforts if the vital and ambitious goals of the congress are to be met this means that businessasusual is not enough prompt vigorous and in many cases expensive pollution control measures must be initiated and completed as promptly as possible in assessing the good faith of a discharger the discharger is to be judged against these criteria moreover it is an established principle which applies to this act that administrative and judicial review are sought on the dischargers own time  8202009 editors note  18 adopted  repealed the former  106181 and enacted a new  106181 as set out herein the former  106181 pertained to jurisdiction
