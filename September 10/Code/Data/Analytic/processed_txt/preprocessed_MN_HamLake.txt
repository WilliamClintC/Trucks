usage of a standard system ists for any lot or lots in a proposed subdivision by reason of the soils having been disturbed or compacted by activities which predated the subdivision application and which conditions were not caused by or at the direction of the subdivider or if said requirements cannot be met after final plat approval because of unusual mottling conditions which were not ascertained by the developer after doing due diligence in completing and analyzing soil borings during the preliminary plat process and in accord with city requirements for such borings the city council may waive the requirement that the ists be constructed on undisturbed soils and may allow the usage of other systems as that term is defined in f of this other systems are so permitted it shall be the obligation of the lot owner to provide actual field designs for each such proposed system prepared by a qualified ists designer prior to obtaining a building permit the design standards

established by the building official at the time that any building permit is requested on any lot for which a tree preservation plan is in effect or on any lot for which such a plan is required the building official shall provide the applicant with a copy of the tree preservation plan and with educational materials concerning tree preservation as may be recommended from time to time by the city council upon recommendation from its park and tree commission 10420 general plat standards a easements the plat shall dedicate a ten foot drainage and utility easement around the entire perimeter of each lot other easements shall be dedicated as required by the city council b parkland dedication i statement of policy it is the policy of the city of ham lake that one acre of public park or trail space should be created for every ten acres of residential land developed in order to create a sufficient supply of public recreational space to accommodate the reasonable needs of the public given the large amount of marginal land and wetlands in the city this acreage goal is difficult to define in terms of taking a percentage of each plat  each plat is different in topography and capacity for development not all upland is capable of housing sewage treatment systems further limiting development in addition parks that serve only a single neighborhood have proven costly to maintain and do not provide for an ideal level of recreational activity in an economic manner it is for this reason that it is not generally practical to require a dedication of ten per cent of the upland in a given plat but is generally more practical to require a park dedication fee in lieu of parkland in order to provide funds for larger parks serving more citizens it is therefore the policy of the city to take dedicated ham lake city  parkland or trails only where such lands can be a part of a larger network larger park system or connected to public waters in all other cases park dedication fees will be used ii upland computation at the time that a wetland delineation is made for a given plat the surveyor preparing the plat work shall notify the city of the acreage of upland in the plat iii land or fee each residential plat shall either dedicate up to 10% of the upland therein as a public park or trail or shall pay a parkland dedication fee or a combination of both the determination of how the parkland dedication requirement will be met will be made by motion of the city council after recommendation from the park and tree commission as early in the platting procedure as is practical if the determination is to dedicate some upland but less than 10% of the upland then the difference between 10% and the amount dedicated shall be paid via a pro rata fee iv fee if a fee is required for all or part of the parkland obligation the fee will be based on the average fair market value of the upland as determined by the city valuation described in b iv a below or by appraisal at the time the plat is submitted for preliminary plat approval pursuant to b iv b below the park dedication fee shall be on a perlot basis and will be computed on the premise that a reasonable fee per lot is ten percent of the fair market value of one acre of raw land if the plat contains land that was previously platted and for which a park dedication fee was charged the area of such land shall be subtracted from the computation of the amount of upland all such fees will be dedicated to the purposes required by law fair market value shall be determined using one of the following methods a annual establishment the city valuation the city council shall establish a peracre value in january of each year by the ordinance which deals with other municipal fees and charges the city council may take into account such data and information as they deem appropriate and may establish different values for different categories of land such as wooded land waterfront land or land abutting wetlands or other physical features the city may also commission an annual appraisal by a licensed fee appraiser to assist in the city valuation and may devise a method by which the city is reimbursed for the cost of the city valuation from parkland dedication fees collected prior to the next annual valuation ham lake city  the city council may alter the city valuation at any time during the year by ordinance all city valuations shall remain in effect until altered by ordinance until the next city valuation the per acre value of undeveloped residential land shall be $2500000 therefore the park dedication fee until the next valuation shall be $2500 per lot b developer appraisal at the time of submission of the preliminary plat the developer may submit an appraisal performed by a licensed fee appraiser that documents a valuation different than the city valuation subject to the following conditions i the developer shall have obtained the written approval of the appraiser by the city administrator prior to ordering the appraisal  and ii the city reserves the right to commission a separate fee appraisal if it deems the developer appraisal inaccurate if the citys subsequent fee appraisal is higher than the developers appraisal the city appraisal shall be binding and the cost of the city appraisal shall be added to the cost of city platting expenses that must be reimbursed by the developer as a part of the platting process v manner of payment parkland fees shall be payable at the time of recording the plat or at the option of the developer may be collected pro rata per lot with the next ensuing transfer of title of each lot in the plat in the event that fees are collected with such subsequent lot sales at the time of recording of the plat the city shall also record a short form development agreement that establishes a lien against the lot for the park fees the citys lien shall be superior to any other encumbrance and any preexisting mortgages must be subordinated to the citys lien no building permits shall be issued for any lot until the city has received evidence satisfactory to its attorney that the short form agreement has been duly recorded and enjoys first priority as a lien in the event that title to a given lot having a city lien is transferred without satisfying the lien no building permits or certificates of occupancy shall be issued as to such lot until the lien is paid all such liens shall bear interest from the date of filing the short form agreement date of payment at a fixed rate of interest equal to the highest published prime rate as published on the date of filing in the wall street journal commonly known as wsj prime if wsj prime ceases to be published the city may substitute another reasonable index vi wetland as parks ham lake city  in the event that the city requests the dedication of designated wetlands as parkland it will be assumed that wetlands carry ten per cent of the value of upland such that the amount of wetland necessary to equate to ten per cent of upland will be ten times the amount of upland that could be required in the plat for example if a plat contains 20 acres of upland and 20 acres of wetland the city could require the dedication of up to two acres of upland to equate to this amount would require 20 acres of wetland therefore if all 20 acres of wetland were dedicated as park that would satisfy the park dedication for that plat vii trails in subdivisions where the city requires the dedication of trails the square footage of the trails that are dedicated may be applied as if it were park dedication and credited against the park dedication requirement for that subdivision viii waiver and alteration where special circumstances are present in a given subdivision in which a developer provides services or considerations of special benefit to the public that are not otherwise required by the city the city council may by motion waive or alter all or any part of the park dedication andor fee requirement for the plat c drainage fund contribution if the city engineer identifies a localized drainage problem which is caused or accelerated by a given plat a drainage fund contribution on a perlot basis shall be paid at the time of final plat execution the contribution amount shall be set by resolution of the city council from time to time and may be paid as lots are sold by the establishment of a municipal lien for payment d title evidence before plat execution the developer shall furnish an abstract of title or registered property abstract which demonstrates that all areas to be dedicated to public use will be free and clear of all encumbrances excepting other nonexclusive public easements which do not interfere with municipal dedications title insurance commitments or policies shall not be acceptable title evidence e uniform street names all streets shall follow the uniform street name grid as maintained from time to time by the anoka county surveyor f plats outletting to unpaved streets no plat which outlets on an unpaved street shall be approved unless adequate assurance is obtained that the unpaved street will be paved to city standards within a reasonable period of time in one of the following two methods ham lake city  i where it appears that a typical special assessment project is feasible to enable the paving project to occur the developer shall pay a perlot fixed fee established by the city council as a contribution to the paving project payable as lots are sold monies so collected shall be maintained in a special fund and dedicated only to the eventual paving of the particular street for which the funds were reserved  ii where it appears that the revenue generated by a typical special assessment project will be insufficient to enable the paving project to occur the developer shall be required to pay for the shortfall and prior to plat execution shall furnish performance security in accord with the citys policies for security to guarantee that the developer contribution will in fact be paid g maintenance of improvements all developerinstalled improvements shall be maintained by the developer for at least one year after acceptance by the city with security posted to guarantee the maintenance the maintenance period shall generally be set by the development agreement but the city shall have the right to require a maintenance period in excess of one year particularly where certain testing results show evidence of substandard or improper construction of improvements h development agreements if a developer proposes to complete all improvements in a plat prior to recording the plat the developer shall be required to execute only a maintenance agreement and to post maintenance security in all other cases a development agreement shall be prepared for each plat containing at least the following provisions i the amount of performance and maintenance security required  ii the treatment of parkland dedication or fees  iii streetlighting costs and escrow for initial power costs  iv provisions for dealing with oak wilt or other vegetation diseases  v the plans and specifications for improvements including completion timetable  vi assurances as to the maintenance of proper insurances and payment of subcontractors  vii special matters pertaining to ponds  viii payment of all municipal fees and expenses  ix such other elements as are deemed necessary by the citys attorney i protective covenants lawful protective covenants shall be encouraged and if requested by the developer to do so the city shall decline to issue building permits for dwellings that do not meet the standards of recorded protective covenants ham lake city  j rain gardens rain gardens are designed depressions in the topography intended to impound surface water runoff so that it may percolate into the soil they are compatible with certain types of decorative improvements such as rock and vegetation and exterior decorative lowprofile fencing or bordering the developer of any subdivision may incorporate rain gardens into new plats upon approval of the city engineer subject to the condition that all rain gardens shall be located in dedicate public drainage and utility easements abutting property owners shall be allowed to but not required to maintain the rain gardens on which their lot abuts subject to certain limiting conditions 1 no obstruction to the flow or percolation of surface water may be imposed within or affecting any rain garden 2 the rain garden shall not be permitted to fill with silt debris or decaying or dead vegetation  3 decorative bordering such as stone commercial paverlandscaping block or decorative minifencing may be placed around the rain garden

soil erosion and sediment control introductionpurpose during the construction process soil and debris is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water eroded soil and debris endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat or fish and other desirable species eroded soil and debris also necessitates cleaning sewers and ditches the purpose of this to control and eliminate to the greatest extent possible storm water pollution and soil erosion and sedimentation in order to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public it establishes standards and specifications for development and conservation practices and planning activities designed to 1 minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any new development or redevelopment in order to reduce flooding siltation streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream and ditch channels  2 minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater

may submit a written request for a waiver of the requirements of this minimum requirements for storm water management may be waived in whole or in part by the city council on recommendation of the city engineer provided that at least one of the following conditions applies a it can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this   b alternative minimum requirements for onsite management of storm water discharges have been established in a storm water management plan that has been approved by the city engineer and the implementation of the plan is required by local ordinance c provisions are made to manage storm water by an offsite facility the offsite facility is required to be in place to be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of storm water control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by onsite practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for longterm operation and maintenance of the storm water practice d the city engineer finds that meeting the minimum onsite management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical characteristics of a site e the project is covered by another portion of the city sufficient attention to stormwater runoff ham lake city  11 general performance criteria for storm water management unless judged by the city to be exempt or granted a waiver the following performance criteria shall be addressed for storm water management at all sites 11 peak flow rates all site designs shall establish storm water management practices to control the peak flow rates of storm water discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the generation of storm water these practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for storm water treatment and to infiltrate storm water runoff from driveways sidewalks rooftops parking lots and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity 11 discharge storm water runoff generated from new development shall not discharge untreated storm water directly into a jurisdictional wetland or local water body without adequate treatment where such discharges are proposed the impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a method acceptable to the city engineer in no case shall the impact on functional values be any less than allowed by the army corps of engineers or the watershed management organizationwatershed district responsible for natural resources 11 channel protection to protect stream channels from degradation specific channel protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the storm water pollution prevention plan 11 sensitive areas storm water discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources ie cold water fisheries shellfish beds swimming beaches recharge areas water supply reservoirs may be subject to additional performance criteria or may need to utilize or restrict certain storm water management practices 11 npdes compliance certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a storm water pollution prevention plan and shall file a notice of intent noi under the provisions of the national pollutant discharge elimination ham lake city  system npdes general permit the storm water pollution prevention plan requirement applies to both existing and new industrial sites 11 hotspots storm water discharges from land uses or activities with higher potential pollutant loadings known as hotspots may require the use of specific structural stps and pollution prevention practices 11 additional requirements prior to design applicants are required to consult with the city engineer to determine if they are subject to additional storm water design requirements 11 sizing the calculations for determining peak flows as found in the storm water pollution prevention plan shall be used for sizing all storm water management practices 11 basic storm water management design criteria stormwater practice plans shall meet the following design criteria 11 minimum control requirements all storm water management practices will be designed so that the specific storm frequency storage volumes eg recharge water quality channel protection 10year 100year as identified in the current storm water pollution prevention plan are met unless the city grants the applicant a waiver or the applicant is exempt from such requirements in addition if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements the city reserves the right to impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to control the volume timing and rate of runoff 11 site design feasibility storm water management practices for a site shall be chosen based on the physical conditions of the site among the factors that should be considered a topography b maximum drainage area c depth to water table d soils e slopes f terrain g head ham lake city  h location in relation to environmentally sensitive features or ultraurban areas applicants shall consult the storm water pollution prevention plan for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting a storm water management practice 11 conveyance issues all storm water management practices shall be designed to convey storm water to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities this shall include but not be limited to a maximizing of flow paths from inflow points to outflow points b protection of inlet and outfall structures c elimination of erosive flow velocities d providing of under drain systems where applicable the storm water pollution prevention plan shall provide detailed guidance on the requirements for conveyance for each of the approved storm water management practices 11 pretreatment requirements every storm water treatment practice shall have an acceptable form of water quality pretreatment in accordance with the pretreatment requirements found in the current storm water pollution prevention plan certain storm water treatment practices as specified in the storm water pollution prevention plan are prohibited even with pretreatment in the following circumstances a storm water is generated from highly contaminated source areas known as hotspots b storm water is carried in a conveyance system that also carries contaminated non storm water discharges c storm water is being managed in a designated groundwater recharge area d certain geologic conditions exist eg karst that prohibit the proper pretreatment of storm water 11 treatmentgeometry conditions all storm water management practices shall be designed to capture and treat storm water runoff according to the specifications outlined in the storm water pollution prevention plan these specifications will designate the water quantity and quality treatment criteria that apply to an approved storm water management practice ham lake city  11 landscaping plans required all storm water management practices must have a landscaping plan detailing both the vegetation to be in the practice and how and who will manage and maintain this vegetation this plan must be prepared by a registered landscape architect or soil conservation district 11 operation and maintenance agreements all storm water treatment practices shall have an enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system functions as designed this agreement will include any and all maintenance easements required to access and inspect the storm water treatment practices and to perform routine maintenance as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the storm water treatment practice in addition a legally binding covenant specifying the parties responsible for the proper maintenance of all storm water treatment practices shall be secured prior to issuance of any permits for land disturbance activities 11 nonstructural storm water practices the use of nonstructural storm water treatment practices is encouraged in order to minimize the reliance on structural practices credit in the form of reductions in the amount of storm water that must be managed can be earned use of nonstructural practices that reduce the generation of storm water from the site these nonstructural practices are explained in detail in the current storm water pollution prevention plan and applicants wishing to obtain credit for use of nonstructural practices must ensure that these practices are documented and remain unaltered by subsequent property owners updated ham lake city  table no 114 physical standards for roadways arterial roads
