indiana legislature has in ic 3674 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions therefore the common council of the city of huntingburg indiana does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations bfindings of fact 1the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated inadequately floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages cstatement of purpose it is the purpose of this subchapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities 2require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction 3control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters 4control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage 5prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 6make federal flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program dobjectives the objectives of this subchapter are 1to protect human life and health 2to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects 3to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public 4to minimize prolonged business interruptions 5to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains 6to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas passed 1092014
