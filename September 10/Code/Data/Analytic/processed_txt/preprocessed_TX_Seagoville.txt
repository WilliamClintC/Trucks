therefore the city council does ordain as follows of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filing grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and    426720 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will

in behalf of the city for the purpose of providing services to the public including existing and new developments b purpose applicability and effect 1 purpose the purpose of a proportionality appeal is to assure that a requirement to dedicate construct or pay a fee for a public infrastructure improvement imposed on a proposed plat or development application as a condition of approval does not result in a disproportionate cost burden on the property owner taking into consideration the nature and extent of the demands created by the proposed development on the citys public facilities systems 2 applicability an appeal under this section may be filed by a property owner to contest any requirement to dedicate land to construct improvements or to pay development fees other than impact fees for a public infrastructure improvement which requirement is imposed under the citys subdivision ordinance to a plat or development application pursuant to this chapter whether the requirement is applicable under uniform standards or is imposed pursuant to an individual evaluation of the proposed subdivision c proportionality determination by citys engineer prior to a decision by the planning and zoning commission on any plat or development application filed under this chapter the citys engineer shall prepare a report affirming that each public infrastructure improvement to be imposed as a condition of plat or development approval is roughly proportionate to the demand created by the development on the citys public facilities systems taking into consideration the nature and extent of the development proposed 1 in making his proportionality determination the citys engineer may rely upon categorical findings pertaining to onsite improvements  the proposed or potential use and intensity of use of the    539720 land  the timing and sequence of development in relation to availability of adequate levels of public facilities  impact fee studies or other studies that measure the demand for services created by the development and the impact on the citys public facilities systems  the function of the public infrastructure improvements in serving the proposed development  the degree to which public infrastructure improvements to serve the subdivision are supplied by other developments  the anticipated participation by the city in the costs of such improvements  any reimbursements for the costs of public infrastructure improvements for which the proposed development is eligible  or any other information relating to the mitigating effects of the public infrastructure improvements on the impacts created by the development on the citys public facilities systems 2 based upon his proportionality determination the citys engineer shall affirm that the public infrastructure improvement requirements of the subdivision ordinance do not impose costs on the developer for such improvements that exceed those roughly proportionate to those incurred by the city in providing public facilities to serve the development 3 the citys engineer may promulgate any application requirements that may assist in making the proportionality determination required by this subsection d commission determination the citys planning and zoning commission shall take into account the citys engineers report concerning the proportionality of public infrastructure

accommodate the vehicular traffic to be generated by the development proposed streets shall provide a safe convenient and functional system for traffic circulation  shall be properly related to the citys thoroughfare plan road classification system comprehensive plan and any amendments thereto  and shall be appropriate and adequate for the particular anticipated traffic volumes and characteristics of each development also see section  adequate public facilities policy 3 road network new subdivisions shall be supported by a road network having adequate capacity ingressegress and safe and efficient traffic circulation the adequacy of the road network for developments of fifty 50 or more dwelling units or for developments generating five hundred 500 or more oneway trips per day or for developments involving collector or arterial streets not appearing on the citys adopted thoroughfare plan shall be demonstrated by preparation and submission prior to or along with the construction plat application of a traffic impact analysis prepared in accordance with subsection f traffic impact analysis which takes into consideration the need to accommodate traffic generated by the development land to be developed in common ownership and other developed property in the event that the property to be developed is intended as a phase in a larger development project or constitutes a portion of the land to be ultimately developed the commission may require a demonstration of adequacy pursuant to this section and section  for additional phases or portions of the property as a condition of approval for the proposed construction plat in the event that the applicant submits a traffic impact analysis for an entire phased development project the city may require an update of the study for each subsequent phase of the development which reflects any applicable changed conditions if the construction plat is in conformance with the thoroughfare plan and if the construction plat is for a development of less than fifty 50 dwelling units or for a development generating less than five hundred 500 oneway trips per day then a traffic impact analysis is not required 4 approach roads and access all subdivisions except for those comprised of an approved culde sac streets must have at least two 2 points of vehicular access primarily for emergency vehicles and must be connected via improved roadways to the citys improved thoroughfare and street system by one or more approach roads of such dimensions and improved to such standards as are hereinafter set forth requirements for dedication of rightofway and improvement of approach roads may be increased depending upon the size or density of the proposed development or if such need is demonstrated by traffic impact analysis a two 2 points of vehicular access shall be construed to mean that the subdivision has at least two 2 improved roads accessing the subdivision from the citys improved thoroughfare system and the subdivision has at least two 2 road entrances the citys planning and zoning commission may at its discretion and upon a finding that such will not compromise public safety or impede emergency access accept a single mediandivided entrance from the citys improved thoroughfare system for a nonresidential subdivision or for a residential subdivision having no more than seventyfive 75 residential lots or dwelling units provided that the median extends into the subdivision for an unbroken length of at least one hundred feet 100 to an intersecting internal street which provides at least two 2 routes to the interior of the subdivision for example the entrance street is not a deadend or culdesac and it does not create a bottleneck allowing only one emergency route into the interior of the subdivision residential lots may not front onto any mediandivided street section and residential driveways may not be located in front of a median also see section u b the subdivision shall be designed to provide adequate emergency access for public safety vehicles each residential lot in the subdivision shall have a minimum frontage on a dedicated public street as

width for such streets shall be provided unless the proposed development is on both sides of the street in which case the full rightofway width shall be provided or unless there is some other compelling reason to require more than half of the rightofway width such as avoiding the infringement upon or demolition of existing structures avoiding crossing a creek or floodplain or some other obstacle or other similar circumstance in some instances more than half of the required width shall be required when a halfstreet is impractical or unsafe and depending upon the actual or proposed alignment of the street such as in the case of a curved street as may be required by the planning and zoning commission b perimeter streets where an existing halfstreet is adjacent to a new subdivision or addition the other half of the street shall be dedicated and an appropriate amount of the street shall be improved by the developer of the new subdivision or addition c slope easements

services which may not be provided are routine law enforcement patrols enforcement of traffic and parking regulations and preparation of accident reports depending upon the characteristics of the development and upon access limitations posed by the design of entrances into the subdivision other services such as sanitation may not be provided as well e private streets petition to convert to public streets the property owners association may petition the city to accept private streets and any associated property as public streets and rightof way upon written notice to all association members and upon the favorable vote of a majority of the membership however in no event shall the city be obligated to accept said streets as public should the city elect to accept the streets as public then the city has the right to inspect the private streets and to assess the lot owners for the expense of needed repairs concurrent with the citys acceptance of the streets the city shall be the sole judge of whether repairs are needed the city may also require at the associations or the lot owners expense the removal of any guard houses access control devices landscaping or other aesthetic amenities located within the street lot or within any other common area f private streets hold harmless the property owners association as owner of the private streets and appurtenances shall release indemnify defend and hold harmless the city any other governmental entity and any public utility entity for damages to the private streets that may be occasioned by the reasonable use of

subdivision by the city or governmental or utility entity d escrow policies and procedures    578720 1 request for escrow whenever this chapter requires a property owner to construct a street or thoroughfare or other type of public improvement the property owner may if there exists unusual circumstances such as a timing issue due to pending roadway improvements by another agency such as txdot or dallas or kaufman county as applicable that would present undue hardships or that would impede public infrastructure coordination or timing petition the city to construct the street or thoroughfare usually at a later date in exchange for deposit of escrow as established in this section if more than one street or thoroughfare must be constructed in order to meet adequacy requirements for roadways as demonstrated by a traffic impact analysis the city manager or designee may prioritize roadways for which escrow is to be accepted and require the deposit of all funds attributable to the development in escrow accounts for one or more of such affected roadways the planning and zoning commission shall review the particular circumstances involved a traffic impact analysis may be required to facilitate the commissions deliberations on the matter and shall make a determination on the matter the commission shall then review the issue and shall make a final determination at its sole discretion whether or not provision of escrow deposits will be acceptable in lieu of the property owners obligation to construct the street or thoroughfare with his or her development during its review and approval of the construction plat for the development 2 escrow deposit with the city whenever the commission agrees to accept escrow deposits in lieu of construction by the owner of the property under this chapter the property owner or developer shall deposit in escrow with the city an amount equal to the share of the costs of design construction permits reviews and approvals inspections any additional land acquisition and an appropriate and realistic inflation factor to ensure that the actual future dollar costs will be covered when actual construction occurs in the future such amount shall be reviewed by the city engineer and approved by the city manager and shall be paid prior to release of engineering plans by the city engineer the obligations and responsibilities of the property owner shall become those of the property owners transferees successors and assigns  and the liability therefore shall be joint and several 3 determination of escrow amount the amount of the escrow shall be determined by using the maximum comparable turnkey bid price of construction of the improvements including design permits reviews and approvals inspections and any additional land acquisition that may be needed such determination of the escrow amount shall be made as of the time the escrow is due hereunder and shall be subject to the review and approval of the city manager or designee and the city engineer 4 termination of escrow escrows or portions of escrowed amounts which have been placed with the city under this section and which have been held for a period of ten 10 years from the date of such payment or agreement in the event that the city has not authorized the preparation of plans and specifications for construction of such roadway facilities for which the escrow was made shall upon written request be returned to the property owner along with onehalf of its accrued interest such return does not remove any obligations of the property owner for construction of the required facilities if a building permit has not been issued on the subject lot or if a new building permit is applied for 5 refund if any street or highway for which escrow is deposited is constructed by a party other than the city or is reconstructed by another governmental authority at no cost to the city the escrowed funds and onehalf of its accrued interest shall be refunded to the property owner or applicant who originally paid the escrow amount after completion and acceptance of the public improvements in the event that a portion of the cost is borne by the city and the other portion of the cost by another party or governmental authority the difference between the property owners actual proportionate cost and the escrowed funds including onehalf of its accrued interest if any shall be refunded after completion and acceptance of the improvements 6 interest limitation if money is refunded within six 6 months of deposit only the principal will be refunded monies returned after this date will be refunded with onehalf of its accrued interest    579720 e traffic impact analysis any proposed development project or plat involving a significant change as determined by the city engineer to a proposed roadway alignment from that shown on the citys thoroughfare plan or involving a development of fifty 50 or more dwelling units or for developments generating five hundred 500 or more oneway trips per day shall be preceded by submission city staff review and planning and zoning commission approval of a traffic impact analysis performed by a qualified traffic engineer and as specified in subsection f below such a proposed roadway alignment change shall also be preceded by an amendment to the citys thoroughfare plan showing the new proposed alignment failure to provide for such approvals prior to submission of a construction plat shall be grounds for denial of the plat application f required components of traffic impact analysis whenever this chapter or the city in certain instances which do not meet the above criteria but which may significantly affect the public health safety or welfare such as a proposed subdivision that will only be accessed via substandard roadways which may pose an impediment to emergency response vehicles requires submission and planning and zoning commission approval of a traffic impact analysis the following elements shall be included 1 general site description the traffic impact analysis shall include a detailed description of the roadway network within one 1 mile of the

service analysis for intersections within the roadway traffic impact analysis area described in subsection f1 herein general site description a level of service analysis shall be performed for all arterial to arterial arterial to collector collector to arterial and collector to collector intersections and for any other pertinent intersections identified by the city also level of service analyses will be required on all proposed site driveway locations for all nonresidential developments the city may waive analysis of minor intersections and site driveway locations within the onemile radius the level of service analysis shall be based upon the highest hourly average am or pm peak weekday volume or highest average hourly peak weekend volume as determined from a twoday survey of weekday volumes and where necessary a oneday survey of weekend volumes the level of service analysis shall take into consideration the lane geometry traffic volume percentage of righthand turns percentage of lefthand turns percentage and typical size of trucks intersection width number of lanes signal timing and progression roadway grades pedestrian and bicycle flows school routes number of

intersections can accommodate the existing service volume the service volume of the proposed development and the service volume of approved but unbuilt developments holding valid unexpired building permits at level of service c or above 5 effect of adequacy determination if the adequacy determination for roadways and intersections indicates that the proposed development would cause a reduction in the level of service for any roadway or intersection within the study area identified in subsection f1 herein that would cause the roadway to fall below the level of service required hereby the proposed development shall be denied unless the developer agrees to one of the following conditions a the deferral of building permits until the improvements necessary to upgrade the substandard facilities are constructed  b a reduction in the density or intensity of development  c the dedication or construction of facilities needed to achieve the level of service required herein  or d any combination of techniques identified herein that would ensure that development will not occur unless the levels of service for all roadways and intersections within the traffic impact analysis study are adequate to accommodate the impacts of such development g arrangement of streets not shown on the thoroughfare plan for streets that are not shown on the citys thoroughfare plan such as local residential streets the arrangement of such streets within a subdivision shall 1 provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets from or into surrounding areas  2 conform to

581720 3 provide for future access such as by stubbing streets for future extension to adjacent vacant areas which will likely develop under a similar zoning classification or for a similar type of land use  and 4 not conflict in any way with existing or proposed driveway openings including those on the other side of an existing or planned mediandivided arterial in which case new streets shall align with such driveway openings such that median openings can be shared h residential collector streets and minor residential streets shall be laid out such that their use by will be discouraged such as via circuitous routes or multiple turns or offsets but such that access is provided to adjacent subdivisions 1 wherever the rightofway width of a collector or residential street must transition to a greater or lesser width such transition shall occur along the front side or rear lot lines of adjacent lots for a reasonable distance and shall not occur within the street intersection itself in other words the rightof way width shall be the same on both sides of the street intersection 2 to the greatest extent possible the number of lots fronting along residential collector streets shall be minimized in order to ensure adequate traffic safety and efficiency no more than twentyfive percent 25% of the total centerline length of a collector street may have residential lots fronting onto the collector on each side of the street for example a collector street having a total centerline length from one terminus to another of 1000 feet may have lots fronting onto it with a total frontage distance of 250 feet on each side of the street calculations shall be submitted with the construction plat application and provided to the municipal development review committee verifying that lots fronting onto a collector street do not exceed the above 3 at least fifty percent 50% of the total centerline length of all streets including collector streets within a residential

corresponding roadway crosssections on the thoroughfare plan and in the citys tcss manual n construction of halfstreets shall be prohibited except when essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conforming with the other requirements of this chapter and the thoroughfare plan and where the city makes a determination that there is no immediate need to be gained by constructing the full street section since no access from the street will be needed by the subdivision in question the city may determine that it would be more practical or cost effective to delay construction of the other half of a street until when the adjoining property is developed if the property owner is responsible for onehalf 12 of the street then the property owner shall either construct the facility along with his or her development or shall provide escrow for the construction cost of his or her share of the facility including all applicable street appurtenances such as median openings left turn

must be kept free of encroachment in order that the 100year flood may be carried without substantial increases in flood heights as defined by fema the area between the floodway and boundary of the 100year flood is termed the floodway fringe the floodway fringe is the area which can be used for development by means of fill according to fema and city engineering criteria and if such is approved by the city following review and approval of a clomar or other detailed flood study as to be determined by the city engineer for the purposes of this chapter the floodway management area fma will

to the city for such consideration in order to qualify for city staff approval in lieu of approval by the planning and zoning commission the proposed changes must be minor in nature such as a to correct an inadvertent error on the originally approved landscape plan that does not significantly affect the quantity of landscaping  b to make minor adjustments to landscape layout due to minor site plan layout changes or other cityapproved changes during construction  c to make minor adjustments to types of plant materials such as if a material is not readily available at the time of planting or some other unforeseen eventuality  etc sec 1 adopted  standards the following criteria and standards shall apply to all landscape materials and installation 1 all required landscaped open areas shall

except for planned development or specific use permit zoning requests and except for the types of developments outlined below can be the first step in the approval process for a development project either residential or nonresidential if the applicant prefers to do so city review and approval of a concept plan has many benefits for both the city and the applicant the applicant benefits in that heshe gains preliminary review and scrutiny as well as input and suggestions on the overall conceptual layout of the proposed development from the citys development review team approval of a concept plan may also offer the applicant some level of confidence that subsequent plan submissions will be favorably received and approved with few major changes to the projects design and layout provided that the project complies with city regulations for example once the site plan and preliminaryconstruction plat and corresponding engineering plans are submitted for a nonresidential project unforeseen changes in site layout can prove to be expensive in terms of design and engineering costs and time lost due to major plan revisions the city benefits in that it is allowed to become familiar with and involved in the project early in the development process which is particularly important for largescale developments and subdivisions this allows the city to plan for and closely coordinate the provision of public facilities and services thereby potentially avoiding future problems such as undersized utility lines inadequate roadway capacities unanticipated shortfalls in public services and fiscal inefficiencies resulting from lack of planning and coordination submission and approval of a concept plan is mandatory for a zoning request for a planned development or specific use permit submission and approval of a concept plan is also required in the following circumstances 1 in conjunction with a zoning or rezoning request for a property that is five 5 acres or
