the city sewer system shall be required to pay a sewer equivalency fee in determining who has or has not paid or contributed proportionately toward the costs and expenses of constructing a sewer line the sole factor shall be whether that user or a predecessor in title of the users property has in fact paid consideration to the city in cash services or inkind for the construction of the sewer trunk line to which he now desires to connect which consideration is commensurate with what the user or his predecessor in title would have paid under this section had the user not paid or contributed

pay for the original sewer line the sewer equivalency fee may be different for residential commercial and industrial users and may be different for differing users within those three 3 classifications

city to be able to benefit properties other than the users the sewer user constructing the extension may request that the city enter into an agreement with the user such that all or a portion of the costs of extending the sewer line will be reimbursed to that sewer user from the connection charges collected under section 9317 of this chapter from those property owners who will benefit from the

assessed to the sewer users own property 3 a reimbursement agreement may provide for interest to be paid to the sewer user 4 the city may charge and may receive a ten percent 10% administrative fee for handling the accounting auditing and payment of the reimbursement payments made to the sewer user so extending the sewer line and having reached a reimbursement agreement with the city 5 all or a part of the sewer equivalency fee associated with the sewer line constructed and paid pursuant to section 9317 of this chapter may be set aside and earmarked for reimbursement pursuant to a reimbursement agreement 6 the reimbursement agreement shall be personal to the sewer user entering into it and shall not be assigned without the written consent of the city which consent will not be unreasonably withheld 7 the agreement will terminate when the user has been fully reimbursed if the agreed upon reimbursement amount is paid prior to the end of the term of the agreement 8 the

set charges the mayor and city council shall determine and set all applicable fees and charges for use of the sewer system this chapter supplants and replaces resolution 240 and amendments thereto the city currently does not have the technology or ability to measure each classs exact use of the sewer system therefore the rates are based on an estimate of each classs contribution or potential contribution to the loading of the sewer system a multiplier is assigned to each class pursuant to the table set forth below the multiplier is not based solely on the amount of water used and discharged into the system but rather takes into consideration other factors such as the estimated amount of bods cods suspended solids and other contaminates that may be discharged into the system by
