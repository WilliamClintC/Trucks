guidelines the following guidelines shall be considered by any official employee board commission or council of the city when taking any action that might result in the physical or regulatory taking

fundamental attribute of ownership banalysis if the acting body determines that a governmental action involves constitutional taking issues the proposed action should be reviewed further to determine appropriate action in reviewing the proposed action the following factors may be analyzed 1the effect the potential taking would have on the use or value of the private property  2the likelihood that the action may result in a constitutional taking  3any alternatives to the proposed action that would fulfill the citys lawful objectives and reduce the risk of a constitutional taking  4the cost to the city for payment of compensation if a taking is determined  5the governmental interest involved and its nexus to the potential taking  and 6the proportionality and relationship between the

to reach the five hundred 500 acre threshold or if such owners otherwise desire combine their properties for planning and development purposes   planning and approval process for pc zone development within the pc zone will require a series of plans to be prepared and submitted for approval the purpose of this process is to clearly establish the development plans for property within pc zones while recognizing the large scale nature of the development and the need for integrated planning the first step is the preparation and approval of a pc zone plan that establishes the development program for the pc zone and upon approval vests the entitlement to build up to the number of dwelling units and up to the square footage of nonresidential uses reflected in the pc zone plan the second step is the creation and approval of the community structure plan that establishes the major infrastructure systems the unifying systems for the development such as open space and transportation corridors and provides locations of the more specific land uses neighborhoods villages towns and business and research parkways the third step is a recorded master subdivision plat that provides more detailed information regarding the proposed development of a multiphased portion of the property and when recorded subdivides portions of the property into logical development units prior to commencing development the developer must submit a project planpreliminary subdivision plat providing sufficient detail for the creation of lots dedication of roads layout of specific land uses and the engineering of requisite infrastructure and a final subdivision plat if the project includes condominiums a condominium map is required as per state law  this process is summarized in the following table  approval step scale area covered what is described approval level by application in plan land area to be rezoned with land use table outlining pc zone and plan total land area to number of

chapter provides for at least two 2 levels of design guidelines to be prepared and recorded as covenants that will establish the design standards for public and private improvements at the time that the master subdivision plat is approved guidelines that govern the design and maintenance of major public infrastructure improvements including without limitation sidewalks street lighting paving street furniture etc and general building placement massing and design criteria will be recorded the second set of guidelines will be created at the time of the project planpreliminary subdivision plat application these guidelines will establish in much greater detail the character and nature of the design of public and private improvements within the area covered by the project planpreliminary subdivision plat the project planpreliminary subdivision plat will be a fully integrated development plan and may simultaneously address subdivision site plan and condominium mapping considerations if all of these considerations are addressed this case the design guidelines shall meet the design guideline requirements of site plans subdivisions and condominium maps the design guidelines developed

established to provide a zone to be used in specific locations near city transportation nodes and corridors with the intent of allowing a mix of specific land uses that are typically found separately in mutually exclusive zoning districts mixed use represents a departure from characteristic zoning to the extent that it encourages a combination of land uses which may be compatible but have traditionally been separated the intent of this zone is to create selfsustaining developments that become walkable areas that provide convenient pedestrian access to mass transit commercial services

intensity regional mixed land uses with maximum building height and bulk standards conducive to transit oriented development the focus of such uses would be in appropriate areas along jordan gateway and i15 in proximity to the frontrunner commuter rail station bmutc subdistrict the purpose of this subdistrict is to encourage the development of medium intensity community and town center mixed uses
