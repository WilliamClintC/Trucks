and purpose the groundwater underlying this town is the only source of its existing and future drinking water supply the groundwater aquifer is integrally connected with and flows into the surface waters lakes streams and coastal estuaries which constitute significant recreational and economic resources of the town used for bathing and other water related recreation shellfish and fishing accidental spills and discharge of petroleum products and other toxic and hazardous materials have repeatedly threatened the quality of such groundwater supplies and other related water resources on marthas vineyard and in other massachusetts towns posing potential public health and safety hazards and threatening economic losses to the affected communities unless preventive measures are adopted to prohibit discharge of toxic and hazardous materials and to control their storage within the town further spills and discharge of such materials will predictably occur and with greater construction commercial and industrial development population and vehicular traffic in the town of oak bluffs and on marthas vineyard the foregoing conclusions are confirmed by findings set forth in the water quality management plan for marthas vineyard april 197 prepared by the marthas vineyard commission pursuant to of the federal clean waters act  by the report entitled edgartown water resource protection plan february 198 prepared for the edgartown board of health by andersonnichols and co inc and public drinking water resource protection plan may 198 by the marthas vineyard commission

plan prccedures 31 general 311 only those plans which constitute subdivisions as that term is defined in require the approval of the planning board however all plans whether subdivisions within the meaning of the law or not must have either approval as a subdivision or endorsement that they do not require approval before they will be accepted for recording at the registry of deeds or registration at the land court 312 plans  intended for review at any meeting of the planning board should be forwarded to the office of the town clerk not later than  pm two working days prior to the

subdivision  3   1 33 small project procedures 331 applicability if he chooses a developer may request to submit his plan under small project procedures which are less demanding than those for a standard project to qualify the subdivision must create frontage potentially serving six or fewer lots  must not be contiguous with property subdivided   ~ within the past five years and now or previously in ownership common with this land  must not be served by access previously developed under small project procedures unless standard project construction requirements for that access have been met and must be approved for such procedures by the planning board at the time of presubmission review 332 limiting agreements any plan approved under small projects procedures must contain or refer to covenants that ho additional lots will be created on land in the same ownership for five years from the date of approval if such land is contiguous or reached via the roads in the small project unless standzrd project construction requirements for that access have been met the plan must be annotated to the effect that lots on that plan are subject to possible betterments for street improvements if the street is accepted by the town steps in processing such plans are the same as for standard projects 34 presubmission review prior to investing in extensive professional design efforts for subdivision plans it will often prove useful to review the proposed development of a parcel of land with the planning board in order that general approaches possible use of cluster development and potential problems can be freely explored pencil sketches which need not be professionally prepared will assist the discussion and might show some but not all of the information shown on a preliminary plan in some cases especially small projects this presubmission review may eliminate need for such a preliminary plan 35 preliminary plan of a subdivision 31 general a preliminary plan of a subdivision may be submitted hy the applicant to the planning board and to the board of health for discussion and approval modification or disapproval by each board the submission of such a preliminary plan will enable the subdivider the p~nning board the board of health other municipal agencies and owners of property abutting the  4  subdivision to discuss and clarify the problems of such subdivision before costly engineering drawings for a definitive plan are prepared therefore it is strongly recommended that a preliminary plan be filed in each case except those where presubmission review has adequateiy clarified all issues 352 application procedure the applicant shall file by delivery or registered mail a notice with the town clerk stating the date of submission for such approval of a preliminary plan to the planning board accompanied by a copy of the completed application form b a properly executed form b see appendix shall be filed with the planning board

in the case of disapproval shall state its reasons therefore failure of the planning board to approve or disapprove the preliminary plan within sixty days shall be construed as approval 355 relation of preliminary plan to definitive plan and zoning provisions approval of a preliminary plan does not constitute approval of a subdivision and a preliminary plan may not be recorded in the registry of deeds provided that a definitive plan is duly submitted within seven months from the date of submission of the preliminary plan the subdivision rules and regulations in effect at the time of

development guidelines by landscape type the following provides criteria for categorizing land into six landscape types based on land form vegetation and existing development for each landscape type expected to be found in oak bluffs guidelines are provided for development consistent with town goals and character the layout and construction of ways within subdivisions shall be so designed as to comply with these guidelines and so as to facilitate vegetative cover and building development consistent with them included in these guidelines are considerations beyond subdivision contro+ such as suggested building materials these are included here as a reference for possible implementation at the developers option both the landscape types and the design guidelines are based largely on looking at the vineyard vineyard open land foundation 1973 further suggestions may be obtained from that report especially pp 1044 developers who believe that alternative guidelines would better meet the general goals being sought are encouraged to state those alternative guidelines as a part of their plan submittal salt lands identification salt ponds salt marsh dunes beaches and the low grassland
