sewer user fee for all parcels of real property in the city connected to the sanitary sewer system the city provides sewer service within its boundaries the amount of money from ad valorem taxes available to the city is inadequate to fund the cost of maintenance and repair of those sanitary sewers but such work must be performed to protect the public health safety and welfare the purpose of this chapter is to provide financing for the ongoing maintenance and repair of the citys sanitary sewer system  exh 1 2012   2003  methodology for rate determination the sewer user fee for any property in any one fiscal year shall be determined by multiplying the total number of sewer units anticipated to be generated by that property in that fiscal year by the effective sewer user fee rate for that fiscal year these factors shall be determined as follows a the total number of sewer units anticipated to be generated by a property for a fiscal year shall be deemed to be equal to the amount of water consumed on that property in the previous calendar year minimizing to the extent feasible the amount of water used for landscaping to determine that amount the three months in the previous calendar year which had the lowest water usage in the city as a whole shall be determined the total number of sewer units anticipated to be generated by a particular property shall be calculated by averaging the amount of water used at that property during such threemonth period and multiplying that average by twelve b the effective sewer user fee rate in any fiscal year shall be determined by dividing the annual sewer program budget for that fiscal year by the total number of sewer units in the entire city for the previous calendar year determined by averaging the amount of water used in the entire city during the three months in that calendar year which had the lowest water usage and multiplying that average by twelve the annual sewer program budget shall be calculated by adding 1 the amount budgeted by the city council in that fiscal year for repair and maintenance of the sewerage system and 2 the cost of engineering administration of the fee and subtracting from said sum the amount of any interest earned on any amounts in the sewer fund balance notwithstanding the foregoing the maximum allowable sewer user fee rate shall not exceed the rate cap established by this paragraph the rate cap shall be one dollar two cents per sewer unit for fiscal year 20032004 thereafter the rate cap shall be increased annually by any increase in the engineering news record construction cost index for the los angeles area as determined in february of each year the rate cap shall increase in accord with the construction cost index regardless of whether or not the sewer user fee rate imposed in any one year reaches the rate cap established for that year  exh 1 2012   2003  collection of charges the sewer user fee shall be collected for each fiscal year on the county of los angeles tax roll in the same manner by the same persons and at the same time as together with and not separately from the general taxes of the city for any fiscal year that the sewer user fee is not collected on the tax roll the city may collect all or a portion of the sewer user fee for such year on the tax roll in the following fiscal year or years  exh 1 2012   2003  expiration of sewer user fee the sewer user fee authorized by this chapter shall be effective from fiscal year 20032004 year 20122013 unless extended in accord with the then required provisions of law the sewer user fee shall expire and be of no further force or effect as of   exh 1 2012   2003  fee adjustment a at any time but no more frequently than once per year the city council may review the status of compliance with this chapter and the degree to which the sewer user fees collected pursuant to this chapter are adequately financing the maintenance and repair of the citys sanitary sewer system by ordinance and after a noticed public hearing the sewer user fee may be increased or decreased to reflect changes in the actual and estimated revenues and costs including without limitation debt service lease payments inflation identification of other funding sources and acquisition and construction costs of sewer maintenance as compared to the previous estimate b upon adoption by the city council of any ordinance which proposes to increase the sewer user fee the city clerk shall provide notice to all owners of parcels subject to the proposed increase such notice shall include a copy of the ordinance

aesthetics and local values b the overarching intent of this chapter is to make wireless communications reasonably available while protecting scenic views and preserving the rural character and aesthetics of the city this will be realized by 1 minimizing the visual and physical effects of wcfs design siting screening techniques and location standards  2 encouraging the installation of visually unobtrusive wcfs at locations where other such facilities already exist  and 3 encouraging the installation of such facilities where and in a manner such that potential adverse aesthetic impacts to the community are minimized c to allow the city to better preserve the established rural character it is the intent to limit the duration of wcf permits in most cases to terms of ten years

this section is to adopt reasonable regulations and procedures consistent with and subject to federal and california state law for compliance with a of the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 201 pub l 11296 codified in 47 usc a and related federal communications commission regulations codified in 47 cfr seq 1 a generally requires that state and local governments may not deny and shall approve requests to collocate remove or replace transmission equipment at an existing tower or base station fcc regulations interpret the statute and create procedural rules for local review which generally preempt subjective landuse regulations limit application content requirements and provide the applicant with a deemed granted remedy when the local government fails to approve or deny the request within sixty days after submittal accounting for any tolling periods moreover whereas of the telecommunications act of 199 pub l 104104 codified in 47 usc applies to only personal wireless service facilities eg cellular telephone towers and equipment a applies to all wireless facilities licensed or authorized by the fcc eg wifi satellite or microwave backhaul 2 the city council finds that the partial overlap between wireless deployments covered under a and other wireless deployments combined with the different substantive and procedural rules applicable to such deployments creates a potential for confusion that harms the public interest in both efficient wireless communications facilities deployment and deliberately planned community development in accordance with local values the city council further finds that a separate permit application and review process specifically designed for compliance with a contained in a section devoted to a will best prevent such confusion 3 accordingly the city of palos verdes estates adopts this section to reasonably regulate requests submitted for approval under a to collocate remove or replace transmission equipment at an existing wireless tower or base station in a manner that complies with federal law and protects and promotes the public health safety and welfare of the citizens of palos verdes estates b prohibition of personal wireless service this section does not intend to and shall not be interpreted or applied to 1 prohibit or effectively prohibit personal wireless services  2 unreasonably discriminate among

environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such emissions comply with all applicable fcc regulations  4 prohibit or effectively prohibit any collocation or modification that the city may not deny under california or federal law  or 5 allow the city to preempt any applicable california or federal law c eligible facility permit any request to collocate replace or remove
