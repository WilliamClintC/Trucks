regulations certain land uses that have a direct and detrimental effect on the character of the towns residential and commercial neighborhoods 7192 the town board makes the following findings about the effect adult uses and sexually oriented businesses have on the character of the towns neighborhoods in making the findings the board accepts the recommendation 66 of its commission that has studied the experiences of other urban areas about such businesses based on studies and findings the town board concludes 7192a adult uses and sexually oriented businesses can contribute to an increase in crime in the area where such businesses are located this can be a burden to the towncounty crime prevention programs and law enforcement services 7192b adult uses and sexually oriented businesses can significantly contribute to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods and can increase neighborhood blight these businesses also can impair the character and quality of the residential housing in the area where such businesses are located this situation could lessen the amount of desirable housing for residents 7192c the concentration of adult uses and sexually oriented businesses in one area can greatly affect the area where such businesses are concentrated and on the quality of urban life a cycle of decay can result from the influx and concentration of adult uses and sexually oriented businesses others may perceive the presence of such businesses as an indication that the area is deteriorating and the result can be devastating that is other businesses move out of the vicinity and residents flee from the area lower property values that can result from the concentration of such businesses erode the town tax base and contribute to urban blight 7192d adult uses and sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary impacts of the types discussed in subsections 7192ac of this section 7192e it is necessary to provide for the special and express regulation of businesses establishments or commercial enterprises that operate as adult body painting studios adult bookstores adult cabarets adult carwashes adult companionship establishments adult hotels or

adultoriented services operating under different names to protect the public health safety and welfare and to guard against the inception and transmission of disease 7192f the commercial enterprises such as the types described in e of this all other similar establishments whose services include sessions offered to adults conducted in private by 67 members of the same or opposite sex and employing personnel with no specialized training are susceptible to operations contravening subverting or endangering the morals of the town by being the site of acts of prostitution illicit sex and occasions of violent crimes and thus requiring close inspection licensing and regulation 7192g control and regulation of commercial establishments of these types in view of the abuses often perpetrated require intensive efforts by the sheriffs department and other departments of the town it is necessary for the town to provide services to all of the town without concentrating the public services in one area the concentrated use of town services detracts from and reduces the level of service available to the rest of the town thus these types of establishments can diminish the ability of the town to protect and promote the general health welfare morals and safety of the town 7192h the board adopts the landuse and licensing regulations in this section recognizing that it has an interest in the present and future character of the towns residential and commercial neighborhoods these regulations are to lessen the detrimental and adverse effects adult uses and sexually oriented businesses have
