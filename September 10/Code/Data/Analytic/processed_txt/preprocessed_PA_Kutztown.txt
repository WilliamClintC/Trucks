management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c a comprehensive program of stormwater management including minimization of impacts of development redevelopment and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the borough of kutztown and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed poses a threat to surface water and groundwater quality e stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality f through project design impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized to maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality groundwater recharge stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems the most cost effective and environmentally advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is project design minimizing impervious surfaces and sprawl avoiding sensitive 104 editors note this ordinance also repealed former art i sacony creek watershed adopted

education which offers both undergraduate and graduate degree programs 2 in addition to those university students who live in housing located upon the university campus many of the students attending the university obtain housing accommodations located within the borough 3 fortyseven and sixtenths percent of the total dwelling units in the borough are currently rental dwelling units 4 approximately 876% of the total rental dwelling units in the borough are currently utilized to house individual students or groups of students 5 approximately 417% of the total dwelling units in the borough are currently utilized as rental dwelling units for the housing of student groups or individual students 6 a comparison of borough police department records of incidents investigated during the period from  to  with records for the period from  to  for the purpose of identifying those police responses to residential addresses which are known to have been utilized at that time for student and student group housing revealed the following a during the 19901991 period 957 incidents were recorded of which 557 were responses to dwelling units housing students as described above b during the 19931994 period 749 incidents were recorded of which 513 were responses to dwelling units housing students as described above  22525 kutztown code  225251  c a comparison of the two time periods in question indicates that a twentytwopercent reduction in overall incidents occurred while the percentage of such incidents attributable to dwelling units housing students increased by 105% d the persistent occurrence at student housing addresses of the types of incidents studied in this analysis of police records particularly incidents of disturbing the peace public drunkenness drinking or possession of open containers of alcohol in restricted areas underage drinking andor driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances presents a danger to public health and safety and undermines the quality of life for the owners and occupants of the other land uses in the vicinity of such dwelling units housing students 7 the enrolled student population of the university was 4891 in 197 5154 in 198 7609 in 1990 and 7762 in 199 while the us census count of the population of the borough was 4166 in 197 4040 in 1980 and 4704 in 1990 8 the oncampus housing capacity of the university is currently 2850 students 9 approximately 1800 university students live in housing in the borough 10 based upon information received from the university it is anticipated that no new oncampus student housing facilities will be constructed by the university for a period of at least 10 years 11 the borough anticipates continued pressure on its housing supply for the purpose of providing student housing 12 the borough previously found it necessary to enact offstreet parking requirements for group dwelling unit uses and permit parking requirements on borough streets in those areas having the greatest density of dwelling units housing students and those areas closest to the university 13 in many neighborhoods of the borough any further increase in the density of the number of dwelling units devoted to student housing will detrimentally and irretrievably alter the character of such neighborhoods and render such neighborhoods to be largely student dormitory districts which are no longer residential singlefamily dwelling unit neighborhoods 14 the preservation of the character and integrity of the boroughs residential areas as well as the prevention of undue concentrations of population and traffic congestion require the imposition of restrictions upon any further increase in the density of dwelling units devoted to student housing  225251 wellhead protection  225251  15 the borough has determined that a student housing density restriction and separation requirement of 500 feet will not prevent the establishment of a number of additional dwelling units housing students in the borough 16 the borough has determined that application of the student housing density restriction and separation requirement to portions of the cc business commercial central district and c1 business commercial district bordering the r1 r2 and r3 residential districts is necessary to prevent a further erosion of the residential character of those
