this section have been fully considered as the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief 3variances shall only be issued upon a ashowing of good and sufficient cause  bdetermination that failure to grant the

shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons for such approval and denial if the variance is granted the property owner shall be put on notice along with the written decision that the permitted building will have its lowest floor below the base flood depth and that the cost of flood insurance likely will be commensurate with the increased flood damage risk dappeals appeals shall be
