generally required to be located according to the uniform plumbing underground between a food facility and the connection to the sanitary sewer system these devices can be large in excess of seven hundred fifty gallons and primarily use gravity to separate fog from the wastewater as it moves from one compartment to the next these devices must be cleaned maintained and have the fog removed and disposed of in a proper manner on a regular interval to be effective interceptors shall be structurally intact including acceptable internal plumbing manhole inspection covers baffles between chambers and a structure not compromised by intruding tree roots etc 2 a grease trap is a device much smaller than a grease interceptor and services up to a maximum of four individual fixtures grease traps

interceptor is determined to be impossible or impracticable h multiple dwelling unit shall mean a building designed and used by three or more families or similar groups of persons living independently of each other which has a common sewer or sewer connection to the citys sewer main i remodeling shall mean a physical change to a food facility that requires a permit or involves any one or more

that have remained in continuous operation and were never required to install a grease interceptor and which have never caused an sso shall be allowed to continue to operate without a grease interceptor j the building official may establish additional guidelines to supplement this chapter regarding but not limited to 1 design and construction of grease control devices  2 the management

food facilities the minimum maintenance frequency for interceptors shall be as follows type of establishment minimum maintenance frequency take out only every 45 days with wok stoves deep fryers or more than one griddle every 20 days take out & seating every 60 days with wok stoves deep fryers or more than one griddle every 30 days seating only every 90 days with wok stoves deep fryers or more than one griddle every 60 days b for existing food facilities with a grease interceptor the maintenance plan shall be determined in one of the following methods 1 in the same manner as for new food facilities under subsection a3 of this section  or 2 the owneroperator of a food facility in existence on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may submit an application to the building official requesting that a maintenance plan other than that identified in subsection a3 of this section be imposed on that food facility due to the fact that the food facility has been following a regular maintenance cycle in the past and based on the particular food facility operation the current regular maintenance plan is adequate to guard against fog passing into the sanitary sewer system upon a determination by the building official that an acceptable grease control device maintenance plan is being followed that meets the minimum requirements set forth in the uniform plumbing then it may be used as the approved maintenance plan for that particular food facility 3 in the event it is determined that a food facility as a result of a change in operations is using a grease interceptor that is smaller in capacity than would be required for that food facility under this chapter the building official may allow the food facility to continue to operate with the smaller grease interceptor provided the food facility prepares a maintenance plan acceptable to the building official that requires more frequent servicing than would otherwise be required if the proper sized grease interceptor was installed c notwithstanding the above if any grease interceptor at any time contains floating oilgrease in the final chamber or sludge in any chamber that is within

the same as defined by the fcc in 47 cfr b7 as may be amended which defines that term differently based on the particular facility type and location for clarity the definition in this chapter organizes the fccs criteria and thresholds for a substantial change according to the facility type and location a for towers outside the public rightsofway a substantial change occurs when 1 the proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than ten percent or the height of one additional antenna array not to exceed twenty feet whichever is greater  2 the proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than twenty feet from the edge of the wireless tower or the width of the wireless tower at the level of the appurtenance whichever is greater  3 the proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved not to exceed four  or 4 the proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the wireless tower including any access or utility easements currently related to the site b for towers in the public rightsofway and for all base stations a substantial change occurs when 1 the proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than ten percent or ten feet whichever is greater  2 the proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than six feet from the edge of the wireless tower or base station  3 the proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground when there are no existing groundmounted equipment cabinets  4 the proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new groundmounted equipment cabinets that are ten percent larger in height or volume than any existing groundmounted equipment cabinets  or 5 the proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the area in proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground c in addition for all towers and base stations wherever located a substantial change occurs when 1 the proposed collocation or modification would defeat the existing concealment elements of the support structure as determined by the planningbuilding director 2 the proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of approval provided however that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval related to height width equipment cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a substantial change described in this section note the thresholds for a substantial change outlined above are disjunctive the failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds means that a substantial change would occur the thresholds for height increases are cumulative limits for sites with horizontally separated deployments the cumulative limit is measured from the originally permitted support structure without regard to any increases in size due to wireless equipment not included in the original design for sites with vertically separated deployments the cumulative limit is measured from the permitted site dimensions as they existed on the date that congress passed a tower means
