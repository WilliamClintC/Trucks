findings of fact it is hereby determined that 1 development projects alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition  2 this stormwater runoff causes increased quantities of waterborne pollutants  and 3 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites therefore the village of minooka establishes these policies applicable to all discharges to surface waters within the village to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation it is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety b purpose the purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction this chapter seeks to meet that purpose following objectives 1 minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding siltation increases in stream temperature and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels   sterling codifiers inc  332649 2 minimize pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development that would otherwise degrade local water quality  3 minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff that flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the predevelopment hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable  and 4 reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and pollution wherever possible management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety c applicability this chapter shall be applicable to all development applications for sites of 10 acre or more unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by

herein and the resulting site is too small to be practicable or when the available land is inappropriate for a school site and it is determined by the village not to require the dedication of land the village may require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication in considering whether a development is small as used herein the village may consider whether the total number of the proposed dwelling units will produce less than the maximum number of students for one school of each school classification in accordance with this chapter the cash

objection the subdivider or developer shall submit an appraisal showing the fair market value of such improved land in the area of his subdivision or other evidence thereof and final determination of

personnel or the financial resources  sterling codifiers inc  510649 for maintenance and improvement there may nevertheless be instances in which the public is better served by providing for private

areas in lieu of or in conjunction with publicly dedicated open space or recreational areas will by reason of the type of development better serve the interests of the public than where wholly public
