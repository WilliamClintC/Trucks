amended to read as follows the roof live load for snow shall be 20 twenty pounds per square foot for all areas of the city of placerville  416 findings the city council of the city of placerville finds and declares that the additions modifications and changes made to these codes are necessary for the protection of the public health safety and welfare due to climatic geological or topographical conditions these amendments are authorized under health and safety 5 and 17958 and are identified as follows a express finding number 1  climatic the city of placerville is located approximately forty five 45 miles east of sacramento and seventy 70 miles west of lake tahoe at an average elevation of  sterling codifiers inc  92710 one thousand eight hundred seventy feet 1870 above sea level it is the transition area between the california central valley and the sierra nevada mountains it experiences a change in precipitation and snowfall from the arid central valley to the deep snow of the mountains the average annual rainfall is thirty six inches 36 this rainfall normally occurs from october to april hourly rainfall for design purposes is three inches 3 per hour or  gpm per square foot as established from data in the el dorado county drainage manual and nearby jurisdictions snow can be expected each winter but usually does not accumulate for an appreciable amount of time historically for at least twenty 20 years the design roof snow load has been twenty 20 pounds per square foot with no reduction allowed climate is one of the greatest impacts to fire behavior and other major emergency events because it cannot be controlled the drying out of wood building components and wildland fuels in the summer months allows for easy ignition and propagation of fire steep narrow often congested streets can lead to longer response times for firefighters therefore the fire classification of roof assemblies and roof coverings should be the most restrictive amendments related to climate cbc section  1607a112 1608a2 b express finding number 2  geological the city of placerville has three 3 dominant eastwest ridgelines which in turn define the principal watersheds with a series of subwatersheds branching off each major watershed divide these subridgelines are generally oriented in a northsouth direction perpendicular to the primary ridgelines the secondary ridgelines are located at regular intervals approximately onefourth 14 of a mile apart the moderate to steep slopes which are characteristic of this topography have a profound influence on the location of roads and hence the development pattern there are no identified active earthquake faults in placerville  however the inactive melones fault does pass eastern part of the city trending in a northsouth direction the city of placerville is subject to ground tremors from seismic events as the city is located in site class c some portions of the city have poor soil conditions that are often expansive in nature due to the potential for seismic activity a need exists for more restrictive design criteria amendments related to geological conditions cbc section 1607a112 1608a2 c express finding number 3  topographical the city of placerville is located in the transition between the california central valley and the sierra nevada mountains three 3 biophysical gradients are apparent a transition from central valley grassland vegetation to mixed needleleaf and broadleaf forests to sierra evergreen forests the threat to placerville from wildland fires is relatively high due to the dense vegetative cover and steeply sloping lands therefore a need exists for additional fire protection measures amendments relating to topographical conditions cbc section   417 filing of findings

of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  7 to ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or

determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be  sterling codifiers inc  112710 modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of placerville to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b appeal board 1 the city council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter 2 the city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in

12 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing subsections b3a b3k of this section have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf 12 acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 5 upon consideration of the factors of subsection b3 of this section and the

to the limitations contained in subsections b and c of this section the director may grant a conditional waiver of the requirement to install a grease interceptor and remove existing food grinders b negligible fog the director may grant for new construction including remodels a conditional waiver to any fse andor property owner that the director determines to have negligible fog discharge and insignificant impact to the public sewer system notwithstanding the granting of a conditional waiver however the fse or property owner may nonetheless be required to provide space and plumbing segregation for future installation of a grease interceptor in making the determination as to whether to grant the conditional waiver the director shall make all of the following findings 1 the quantity of fog discharge as measured or indicated by the size of the fse based on kitchen ventilation requirements water usage menu seating capacity number of meals served amount of on site consumption of prepared food number of plumbing fixtures and other conditions does not indicate that the fse will materially contribute to existing or potential fog discharges 2 the fse does not appear to be a significant contributor of fog into the sewer system which is based on an inspection of the property or sampling of fog discharged from the fse to the sewer system 3 the fse has adopted and implemented adequate bmps and has no recent history of noncompliance with the citys fog related regulations and requirements 4 the size grade and condition of the sewer lines serving the fse do not indicate that the fse has discharged an excessive amount of fog in the sewer and the history of maintenance blockages and ssos in the public sewer system lines receiving flow from the fse do not deviate substantially from those experienced in other adjacent sewer lines 5 there is no reason to believe that the operations of the fse will change in the foreseeable future in a manner that may significantly increase the amount of fog the fse will discharge 6 there is no other condition reasonably related to the generation of fog discharges into the sewer by the fse that will in the sound judgment of the director warrant the denial of the conditional waiver in the interest of protecting the public health safety and welfare c installation not feasible where the installation of a grease interceptor in an existing structure is not feasible an fse andor property owner may be granted a conditional waiver of the grease interceptor requirement upon the payment of a grease disposal mitigation fee as described in section 7518 of this chapter additional requirements may also be imposed to mitigate the discharge of fog into the public sewer system the directors determination to grant the waiver upon the payment of a grease disposal mitigation fee will be based upon one or more of the following findings 1 there is inadequate space for installation andor maintenance of a grease interceptor  2 there is inadequate slope for gravity flow between kitchen plumbing fixtures and the proposed grease interceptor andor between the proposed grease interceptor and the lateral or the public sewer system  3 any other condition reasonably related to the installation operation maintenance andor inspection of a grease interceptor which makes installation andor maintenance of a grease  sterling codifiers inc  345710 interceptor infeasible d application for conditional waiver of requirement for grease interceptor an fse or property owner may submit to the director an application for conditional waiver from the grease interceptor requirement the party applying for the conditional waiver bears the burden of demonstrating that the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible or otherwise required a waiver may be issued upon determination by the director that reasons are sufficient to justify such a waiver as provided in subsections b and c of this section e terms and conditions of waiver the conditional waiver shall contain the terms and conditions that serve as the basis for its issuance a waiver may be revoked by the director at any time upon his or her determination that any of the terms or conditions for its issuance have not been satisfied or if the conditions upon which the waiver was based have changed so that the justification for the waiver no longer exists the waiver shall be valid so long as the fse remains in compliance with the terms and conditions until the expiration date specified in the waiver or until the conditional waiver is revoked f revocation of conditional waiver of the requirement to install a grease interceptor the director may revoke any conditional waiver of the requirement to install a grease interceptor which also revokes the waiver to remove existing food grinders granted pursuant to this section subject to the procedures and limitations provided in this subsection 1 should the director determine that due to changed circumstances or failure to comply with the terms or conditions imposed upon the issuance of the conditional waiver a conditional waiver that was previously issued and remains valid should be revoked the director shall provide notice by regular mail to the owner of the affected fse and the property owner no less than thirty 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of the revocation the notice shall provide an explanation of the facts and circumstances that the director has determined warrant revocation of the conditional waiver and an opportunity to respond in writing to the director with information and evidence to justify the continuation of the conditional waiver in accordance with its terms and conditions 2 prior to making the final determination to revoke a conditional waiver the director shall review and consider the written information provided pursuant to subsection f1 of this section 3 the determination of the director to revoke a conditional waiver granted pursuant to this section shall be set forth in writing provided to the owner of the affected fse and the property owner by regular mail and shall be based on the directors reasonable determination that one or more of the following circumstances exists or has occurred a the owner of the affected fse andor the property owner has failed to abide by any term or condition imposed upon the conditional waiver  b one or more of the findings made by the director pursuant to subsection b or c of this section due to changes in the operation of the fse changes in the condition use or available capacity of the sewers serving the fse or other changed circumstances are no longer true  or c a change in law bearing upon the use or operation of the citys sanitary

the city council finds and declares that the purpose of this chapter is as follows  sterling codifiers inc  474710 a the general plan of the city requires that the city be provided in a time frame related to its development with an adequate level of traffic and circulation infrastructure b new development and the expansion of existing development within the city imposes a burden on the existing traffic and circulation infrastructure by adding additional traffic and by creating a need for new traffic and circulation infrastructure such burdens may vary by the type of land use c analysis of the land use expected at buildout of the city pursuant to the general plan makes it possible to estimate the number of trips generated by different types of land uses to analyze the traffic and circulation infrastructure or facilities necessary to support those trips and to determine which land uses will utilize such infrastructure it is therefore possible to construct a fee based on trip generation which equitably spreads the burden of traffic and circulation infrastructure or facilities to those who will create the need for them and utilize them it is the intent of this chapter to create such a fee spreading costs of traffic and circulation infrastructure to those who create the need for such infrastructure without generating any surplus to the general fund it is the further purpose of this chapter to implement the general plan by assuring that adequate public facilities are financed and provided to serve the city d the fee established by this chapter has been calculated in the manner set forth in the study so as to pay for those facilities listed in the traffic mitigation fee capital improvement program e the fee established by this chapter is in addition to any other fees or charges required by law as a condition of development f the fee established by this chapter is to be collected for public improvements and facilities for which an account has been established and funds appropriated g the failure to impose the conditions and regulations of this chapter relating to payment of the fee on building permits would jeopardize residents of the community in that it would permit construction to proceed without adequate infrastructure or means of financing said infrastructure h the requirement of this chapter to pay the fee is necessary in order to assure compliance with the applicable zoning ordinance and general plan requirements for the infrastructure funded by this chapter i for a period of greater than ten 10 days prior to adoption of this chapter data has been available to the public and to developers and their representatives indicating the cost or estimated cost of all the infrastructure to be funded the revenue sources anticipated
