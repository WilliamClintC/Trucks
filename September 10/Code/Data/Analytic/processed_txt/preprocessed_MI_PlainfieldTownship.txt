municipalities  the findings reported in the final report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented business prepared by the minnesota attorney general and statistics obtained from various health departments the board specifically finds that 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are often uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments  there must be in place a mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 crime statistics show that all types of crimes especially sexrelated crimes occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located 3 sexual acts occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provided private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live shows 4 offering and providing such booths andor cubicles encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses 7 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact 8 according to the best scientific evidence available aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 9 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 10 nude dancing in adult establishments encourages

other property within and downstream of the township are at times subjected to flooding  2 flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is also a danger to the natural resources of the township and the region  3 land development projects and activities alter the hydrologic response of watersheds resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes increased flooding increased stream channel erosion and increased sediment transport and deposition  4 stormwater runoff produced by land development contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants  5 increases of stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollutants have occurred in the past as a result of land development and constitute deterioration of the water resources of the township and downstream municipalities  6 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution due to land development activities within the township have resulted in a deterioration of the water resources of the township and downstream municipalities  7 increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes and the sediments and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects within the township will absent reasonable regulation and control adversely affect the townships streams and water resources and the streams and water resources of downstream municipalities and they exacerbate existing adverse conditions  8 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation of stormwater runoff from development projects  9 the isolated construction of one or twofamily residential structures often but not always results in significantly less stormwater runoff and the negative impacts associated with stormwater runoff than other types of construction activities when those residential structures are constructed on platted lots or site condominium units for which stormwater review has already

landforms can be included in the category of critical natural areas unlike many other types of features such as woodlots wildlife and even groundwater once landforms are gone they are not renewable for this reason they play an important role in building community character this fact is clearly evident on the east beltline with its rolling topography the majority of participants in the planning process for the north east beltline joint development plan viewed these visual attributes as important features development of hillsides can affect the equilibrium of vegetation surface geology slopes soils and runoff it can also drastically change the way community or neighborhood character is perceived for these reasons the following regulations shall apply 2 protection of wetlands streams and

in such case the driveway midpoint should be located at the property line between two parcels all parties shall agree to the joint driveway in writing if options listed above are not reasonably feasible the planning commission may allow the next lowest spacing from table 1 for example on 50 mph roadway requiring 140 meters 455 feet  spacing the distance may be reduced to no less then 105m 350 feet  which is the spacing for 45 mph speed if all the above options are impossible an access point may be allowed within the property limits b in the event that two or more adjacent parcels do not have sufficient frontage to maintain adequate spacing for access the planning commission may require the dedication of joint access easements or cross access easements for shared access to the public street 5 passing flares at driveways rightturn lanes or tapers at intersections and leftturn lanes or passing flares at intersections shall be provided in accordance with michigan department of transportation guidelines 6 intersection corner clearance accesses shall not be situated within the functional boundary of atgrade intersections this boundary includes the longitudinal limits of right

mile road serves as the boundary line between algoma and plainfield township it also serves as a major road connecting the city of rockford with us 131 and as such 10 mile road is a gateway to all three communities the city of rockford algoma and plainfield townships therefore share a common interest in the future development of 10 mile road the future use of the land abutting this roadway particularly at the us 131 interchange and the amount of traffic carried by 10 mile road will affect all three communities in order to create a positive future cooperation among all three communities is essential the three communities of algoma township plainfield charter township and the city of rockford have jointly adopted the 10 mile road corridor plan which sets forth transportation and land use objectives for the corridor as well as recommendations for future land use the intent of the 10 mile road overlay zone is to provide for a set of zoning regulations to carry out the 10 mile road corridor plan these regulations are compatible with a similar zone in algoma township and the city of rockford the specific purposes of this district are to a maximize the capacity of the road by limiting and controlling the number and location of driveways and requiring alternate means of access driveways service drives and access from side streets b ensure sufficient rightofway for future widening of 10 mile road as properties develop and redevelop c provide nonmotorized pathways along 10 mile road d facilitate highquality development and redevelopment of commercial and office districts architecture efficient site design and landscaping e require low level signs to minimize motorist distraction avoid blight and clutter promote aesthetics and unify signage with the overall character desired in the corridor while providing property owners and businesses with an appropriate mechanism in which to identify their location and business f require landscaping on sites along the corridor as they develop and redevelop to attain the desired green space buffering between uses and the high quality appearance of the corridor g preserve important existing natural features which
