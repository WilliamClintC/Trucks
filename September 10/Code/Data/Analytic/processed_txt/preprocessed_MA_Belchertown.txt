and other land use conversions and their associated changes to land cover have the potential to permanently alter the function of local watersheds resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes which in turn increase flooding stream channel erosion sediment transport and discharge and nonpoint source pollution and decrease groundwater recharge adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized application of stormwater best management practices bmps and lowimpact development principles a lowimpact development lid seeks a balance between human activities and protecting habitat and important natural resources it is about maintaining environmental quality of life that gives the communities we live in a sense of place the goal of lid is to integrate human development into the landscape in a way that is mindful of natural ecosystems and does not disrupt the complex hydrologic cycle that maintains them lid can be applied density reduced impervious surface coverage lot size open spacetree retention street design street width parking design sidewalks and stormwater management practices because lid involves a comprehensive approach it must be integrated into municipal policies regulations and development standards in order for it to be effective b careful planning of development redevelopment and land conversion projects will protect the quality and health of the water resources of belchertown therefore the town of belchertown enacts this stormwater management bylaw to prevent potential harmful impacts from land development activities c in addition localities in the commonwealth of massachusetts are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws bylaws and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of construction site runoff postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution d  11113 solid waste  1121   1122 purpose therefore the town of belchertown has established this chapter to provide reasonable guidance for site planning and stormwater management for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation this chapter addresses construction and postconstruction stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment projects e this chapter is not retroactive and does not affect current or approved land development or redevelopment applications f the purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing requirements and procedures to control the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment the objectives of the chapter are to establish regulations for land development activities that preserve the health of water resources by reducing the adverse water quality impacts from stormwater discharges to rivers lakes reservoirs and streams in order to attain federal water quality standards  1 require that new development redevelopment and all land conversion activities maintain the natural hydrologic characteristics of the land in order to reduce flooding stream bank erosion siltation nonpoint source pollution property damage and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  2 prevent the discharge of pollutants including hazardous chemicals into stormwater runoff  3 minimize the volume and rate of stormwater discharges to rivers lakes reservoirs and

policies these regulations or any portions thereof may be amended supplemented or repealed from time to time by the board with notice as provided by law on its own motion or by petition c the purpose of these regulations is to clarify and define the 1989 belchertown wetlands protection bylaw76 hereafter referred to as the bylaw administered by the belchertown conservation commission hereafter commission the bylaw identifies and protects certain wetland resource areas and the interests the general public has in these areas these regulations establish a uniform process by which the commission can review and regulate activities that affect the resource areas and interests identified by the bylaw a in addition the commission wishes to provide clear guidance to applicants regarding the policies that the commission has determined are necessary to protect wetland resource areas based on belchertowns particular topography and hydrology by the special value these resource areas have to belchertown and to neighboring communities and by the commissions past experience with wetlands protection b no net loss policy it is the policy of the belchertown conservation commission to follow the no net loss guidelines set forth by the massachusetts department of environmental protection therefore applicants who propose to alter resource areas under the commissions jurisdiction must 1 demonstrate that there is no practicable alternative a 76editors note see ch 139 wetlands protection  28518 belchertown code  2902  2 minimize impacts where they are unavoidable mitigate losses of wetland resource area where applicable or appropriate on at least a  basis limited projects are included in this requirement 3 no net change in stormwater runoff it is the policy of the belchertown conservation commission to require applicants to demonstrate that no significant change in offsite runoff will result from proposed work because increased runoff impacts land downstream and reduces natural groundwater recharge the commission may require measures such as stormwater detention basins to prevent increased runoff direct discharge of runoff into a resource area will not be allowed b resource areas the conservation commission has determined that certain additional areas of jurisdiction are significant to the protection of interests identified in the belchertown wetlands bylaw the commission presumes that the following additional resource areas are significant to those interests  isolated wetlands greater than 5000 square feet  ponds greater than 5000 square feet  ephemeral pools a these presumptions are rebuttable and may be overcome upon a clear showing that said land does not play a role in the protection of interests identified in the bylaw b 1 in addition it is the policy of the commission to advise applicants on three nonregulated wetland resource areas a intermittent streams upgradient of wetland resource areas isolated land subject to flooding below 310 cmr 1057 size thresholds b c isolated wetlands less than 5000 square feet 2 the commission will make every effort to identify these areas at the site will recommend locating them on the plans will encourage applicants to avoid impacts to these areas and will suggest possible measures to mitigate unavoidable impacts with respect to drainage and flood control 3 c vegetated buffer strip development proposed in the buffer zone can negatively impact the abutting resource areas negative impacts both from the construction and use phases of the project can include erosion siltation loss of pollution attenuation loss of groundwater recharge reduced water quality and loss of wildlife habitat a twenty d  2902 subdivision of land  2902   2903 values protected by the bylaw the following are the values under the belchertown wetlands bylaw fivefoot strip of continuous undisturbed indigenous vegetative cover along the resource area boundary within the onehundredfoot buffer zone shall be maintained where practicable in order to protect water quality improve water recharge reduce erosion and pollution to the adjacent wetland resource areas and provide wildlife habitat request for determination versus notice of intent many times applicants are confused regarding when to file a request for determination and when to file of a notice of intent for work in the buffer zone for a project to be issued a negative determination the commission must be assured that the potential for alteration of a resource area is so insignificant as to not require the oversight provided by an order of conditions and subsequent certificate of compliance therefore the commission may typically consider issuing a negative determination to projects that meet the following minimum criteria 1 there is no alteration of a wetland resource area 2 there is less than 1000 square feet of alteration in the buffer 3 no work will occur within 50 feet of a wetland resource area 4 leach field of a septic system is 100 feet from resource area a plan is included for permanent stabilization including loaming seeding and mulching 5 erosioncontrol measures are maintained until permanent vegetation is established 6 e a protection of public and private water supply b protection of groundwater and groundwater quality c protection of surface water and surface water quality d flood control e storm

which in the judgment of the commission will remove fill or alter an area subject to protection under the bylaw is subject to regulation under the bylaw and requires the filing of an application for permit  2907d 1 activities within the buffer zone any activity proposed or undertaken within 100 feet of an area specified in 1 5 hereinafter called the buffer zone which in the judgment of the commission will alter an area subject to protection under the bylaw is subject to regulation under the bylaw and requires the filing of an application for permit 2 activities outside the areas subject to protection and the buffer zone see 310 cmr 1002c 3 b where natural vegetation is absent as a result of mowing grazing or other disturbance the presence of hydric soils soils that are annually saturated as evidenced by the observed groundwater soil gleying or soil mottling within 18 inches of the surface shall provide positive determination of jurisdiction in cases where natural vegetation is absent as a result of filling or draining historic evidence and record may provide positive determination of jurisdiction c  2903 subdivision of land  2905   2905 general provisions burden of proof

rivers streams ponds and lakes isolated wetlands are likely to be significant to public or private water supply groundwater supply flood control storm damage prevention prevention of pollution and the protection of wildlife habitat isolated wetlands may be found either in areas with low flat topography or below sidehill seeps these areas provide temporary storage of water resulting from runoff rising groundwater or where groundwater breaks out of a slope forming a sidehill seep thereby providing for flood control and prevention of flood damage alteration can result in the lateral displacement of retained water into adjacent properties resulting in modified drainage patterns with the potential for property damage a isolated wetlands are areas where groundwater may discharge to the surface either by a rising water table or from a sidehill seep under some circumstances surface water may discharge b 1 g  29011 subdivision of land  29011  to the groundwater in these areas

definition critical characteristics and boundary isolated wetlands are freshwater wetlands as defined in these regulations that do not border on creeks rivers streams ponds and lakes isolated wetlands may occur in a depression or closed basin in otherwise flat topography in these areas water may pool above the surface at least once a year or may be contained in the top 18 inches of soil in addition

land subject to flooding see 310 cmr 1057 j variance see 310 cmr 1058 k rare species see 310 cmr 1059 l wildlife habitat evaluations see 310 cmr 1060 preamble ephemeral pools are usually isolated depressions or closed basins that serve in most years as ponding areas for runoff or high groundwater that has risen to the surface ephemeral pools are by definition of seasonal duration  accordingly the degree of wetness necessary for the establishment of a typical wetland plant community does not exist in most cases since the temporary nature of ephemeral pools precludes the presence of fish species these areas are able to support viable populations of several amphibian and invertebrate species which are highly vulnerable to fish predation the presence of a sustaining population of any 1 a  29011 subdivision of land  29012  species of fish at a site in question would rule it out as an ephemeral pool ephemeral pools are not located within resource areas under jurisdiction of the massachusetts wetlands protection act but serve as vernal pool habitat where one of these ponded areas is shown to be vernal pool habitat it shall be considered an ephemeral pool under these regulations and presumed significant to the protection of wildlife habitat 2 definition critical characteristics and boundary definition ephemeral pools are isolated depressions or closed basins which temporarily confine water during periods of high water table and high input from spring runoff snowmelt or heavy precipitation and serve as vernal pool habitat they are essential breeding sites for certain amphibians which require isolated areas that are generally flooded for at least two continuous months in the spring andor summer and are free from fish predators most of these amphibians remain near the breeding pool during the remainder of their life cycle many reptiles birds and mammals also feed here 1 critical characteristics temporality ephemeral pools generally fill up during the spring rains and snowmelt dry up during the summer and may fill again during the fall rains or during summer thundershowers an area where water stands on a yearround basis will not be considered to be a temporary wetland it may be an isolated wetland the cycle of filling and drying may occasionally miss a year due to dry conditions a isolated depressions shallow areas of no minimum size where water ponds in response to flooding high groundwater or inputs from rain and snow meltwater and which lack permanent inlets or outlets b organic accumulation the presence of a welldeveloped organic layer is a feature of most ephemeral pools these pools have generally existed since the end of the glacial period and will probably continue in their semiopen condition for many more thousands of years unless artificially altered these pools act as traps for organic matter especially during the autumn when they trap quantities of airborne leaves the presence of waterstained leaves in a depression which is otherwise dry is a good indicator that the area temporarily serves to pool water c 2 boundary because ephemeral pools are dry much of the year it may be necessary to determine their boundaries using indicators other than pooled water further because the area inundated varies so widely from year to year pooled water is not a good 3 b  29012 belchertown code  29012   29013 buffer zone indicator of extent an ephemeral pool boundary shall be determined using a combination of pooled water if present and the presence of a depression covered by watersoaked leaves water marks or lack of moss on trees buttressed tree trunks shallowrooted trees or adventitious roots on trees other indicators of the temporary pooling of water such as the presence of caddis fly cases or fingernail or pea clams can also be used the burden of proof for identification of an ephemeral pool shall be upon the conservation commission identification must be made prior to the close of a public hearing and shall follow the guidelines for vernal pool certification criteria established by the massachusetts division of fisheries and wildlife in the case of disputes hydrological calculations using the twoyear storm may be used to provide a determination of the boundary of an ephemeral pool presumption where a proposed activity involves the removing filling dredging or altering of an ephemeral pool the conservation commission shall presume that such an area is significant to the protection of wildlife habitat particularly amphibian breeding habitat this presumption is rebuttable and may be overcome upon a clear showing that the ephemeral pool does not play a role in the protection of wildlife habitat in the event that the presumption is deemed to have been overcome the commission shall make a written determination to this effect setting forth its grounds c general performance standards a proposed project in a ephemeral pool shall not result in the following any impairment of the capacity of the ephemeral pool as well as the area within 100 feet of the mean annual boundary of the ephemeral pool to provide wildlife habitat alterations may be permitted if they will have no adverse effects on wildlife habitat as determined by the procedures listed in 310 cmr 1060 1 endangering statelisted species which shall be protected under the procedures listed in 310 cmr 1059 2 d preamble it is the commissions experience that any project undertaken in close proximity to a wetland resource area has a high likelihood of resulting in some alteration of that area either immediately as a consequence of construction or over a longer period of time as a consequence of daily operation of the completed project these negative impacts from construction as well as longterm use in the buffer zone can include erosion siltation loss of groundwater recharge poor water quality characteristics and loss of wildlife habitat the commissions prime concern in the buffer zone is the ultimate impact on the adjacent wetland resource area from both the construction and use phases of the proposed activity the policy of the commission is to have the applicant maintain a strip of continuous a  29012 subdivision of land  29013  undisturbed indigenous vegetative cover in the buffer zone adjacent to the resource area to reduce erosion and pollution to the adjacent wetland resource area maintain water quality improve water recharge and provide wildlife habitat definition and critical characteristics definition the buffer zone is that area of land extending 100 feet horizontally outward from the boundary of any resource area specified in  2904a 1 critical characteristics where surface runoff or groundwater from the buffer zone drains toward the resource area vegetative cover and soils may filter runoff and provide uptake or renovation of pollutants from adjacent areas thereby protecting water quality within the resource area the vegetation and soils may slow surface runoff and permit infiltration of precipitation maintaining the hydrologic regime to which the resource area is adapted a indigenous vegetation is often used by wildlife for important functions such as nesting feeding and protective cover sites dense understory in wooded areas may provide nesting sites travel corridors and protective cover for a wide variety of fauna cutting of vegetation especially canopy trees alters the physical environment by allowing more light and air and may increase temperatures during the summer and decrease temperatures in winter b 2 b presumption a continuous twentyfivefoot vegetated buffer strip between development activities in the buffer zone and the resource area to be protected shall be presumed to be significant to the interests specified in the preamble above this is rebuttable and may be overcome upon a clear showing that said land will not play a role in the protection of said interests in the event that the presumption is deemed to have been overcome the issuing authority shall make a written determination to this effect setting forth the grounds the following activities within the twentyfivefoot buffer strip shall be presumed not to be significant to interests specified in the preamble above ongoing landscaping activities on existing developed lots continued mowing landscaped plantings and selective pruning provided that soil is not exposed to erosion there is no change in grade and sod cover or natural litter layer is maintained a construction or installation of fences or structures not

any work within the buffer zone shall not result in alteration of any resource area or if work within the buffer zone which alters a resource area is permitted by the commission the alteration of the resource area shall comply with the applicable performance requirements for the altered resource area and any other conditions the commission may require to enforce those performance requirements 1
