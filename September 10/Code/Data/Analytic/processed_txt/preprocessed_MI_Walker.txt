shows d offering and providing such booths andor cubicles encourages such activities which create unhealthy conditions e persons often frequent certain adult theatres and other adultoriented businesses for the purposes of engaging in sex within the premises of such adultoriented businesses f communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in adultoriented businesses g the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact h according to the best scientific evidence available aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts i sanitary conditions in some adultoriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities j these findings raise substantial governmental concerns and indicate that it is necessary to promulgate reasonable and uniform regulations for adultoriented businesses to protect the public health safety and welfare  52305 definitions the following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this article unless otherwise specifically stated  adult cabaret

other property within and downstream of the city are at times subjected to flooding  2 flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is also a danger to the natural resources of the city and the region  3 land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes increased flooding increased stream channel erosion and increased sediment transport and deposition  4 stormwater runoff produced by land development contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants  5 increases of stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution have occurred as a result of land development and cause deterioration of the water resources of the city and downstream municipalities  6 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution due to land development within the city have resulted in a deterioration of the water resources of the city and downstream municipalities  7 increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes and the sediments and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects within the city will absent reasonable regulation and control adversely affect the citys water bodies and water resources and those of downstream municipalities  8 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation of stormwater runoff from development  9 adopting the standards criteria and procedures contained in this chapter and implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects of stormwater runoff  10 adopting these standards is necessary for the preservation of the public health safety and welfare 11 illicit discharges contain pollutants that will significantly degrade the citys water bodies and water resources 12 illicit discharges enter the citys municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 direct connections eg wastewater piping either mistakenly or deliberately connected to the storm drains or indirect connections eg infiltration into the stormdrain system or spills connected by drain inlets 13 establishing the measures for controlling illicit discharges and connections contained in this chapter and implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects of illicit discharges  42803 purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to accomplish among others the following objectives 1 to reduce artificially induced flood damage  2 to minimize increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes from identified new land development  3 to minimize the deterioration of existing watercourses culverts and bridges and other structures  4 to encourage water recharge into the ground where geologically favorable conditions exist  5 to prevent an increase in nonpoint source pollution  6 to maintain the integrity of stream channels for their biological functions as well as for drainage and other purposes  7 to minimize the impact of development upon stream bank and streambed stability  8 to reduce erosion from development or construction projects  9 to preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resources by means of controlling increased flood discharges stream erosion and runoff pollution  and 10 to reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution wherever practicable from lands that were developed without stormwater management controls meeting the purposes and standards of this chapter 11 to reduce the adverse impact of changing land use on water bodies and to that end this chapter establishes minimum standards to protect water bodies from degradation resulting from changing land use where there are insufficient stormwater management controls  12 to regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 from stormwater discharges  13 to prohibit illicit discharges and connection to the municipal separate storm sewer system 14 to establish legal authority to carry out all inspection surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to endure compliance with this chapter  42803 applicability exemptions and general provisions 1 this chapter shall apply to any development site as defined in subsection 67512 and subsection 67514 which requires approval of a plat

performance standards in order to achieve the goals and purposes of this chapter the following three stormwater management zones zones a b and c are hereby established the zones are shown on the map attached as appendix a and made a part of this chapter 1 zone a represents areas which require the most protective stormwater management regulations the goal of this zone is to preserve the natural condition of water bodies included in it in whole or in part zone a is usually located in environmentally sensitive areas in the upper reaches of the watershed zone a has in general little impervious surface area and few stormwater facilities in this zone when site conditions permit infiltration of stormwater runoff shall be required rather than the directed flow of stormwater runoff into water bodies this stormwater management practice provides greater protection for surface water quality and also assists in augmenting stream base flow reduction of flash storm flows and prevention of stream bank erosion specifies design criteria for zone a in order that the volume and rate of stormwater runoff are controlled at predevelopment levels 2 zone b represents developed areas that have significant impervious surfaces and stormwater runoff facilities in place the goal of zone b is the control of stormwater runoff in order to prevent further destabilizing of streams and other water bodies in this zone the use of detention ponds the maintenance and enhancement of buffer strips and other measures to reduce directly connected impervious areas are specified in section 6744 for the achieving of the stormwater management standards applicable to zone b the management practices for this zone are intended to maintain existing water quality and to alleviate adverse downstream impact on water bodies 3 zone c consists of highly urbanized areas or areas where there has been significant modification of drainageways the amount of impervious surface area in zone c is generally greater than 25 percent among the measures required in zone c as stated in section 6744 are the use of sediment basins the maintenance and enhancement of buffer strips along water bodies and the reduction of impervious surface areas that are directly connected to water bodies an important element of stormwater management practice in zone c is the control and prevention of sedimentation in order to reduce pollution of water bodies  42803 design standards the design standards for stormwater runoff facilities for zones a b and c as described in section 6743 are the following zone a zone b zone c criteria high quality waters meets water quality standards less than 10% imperviousness degraded physical biological or water quality indicators 10% to 25% imperviousness heavily degraded physical biological or water quality indicators greater than 25% imperviousness stormwater management standards use infiltration basins infiltration trenches extended detention basins andor constructed wetlands maintain and enhance buffer strips use detention ponds  maintain and enhance buffer strips and reduce directly connected impervious area use sediment basins maintain and enhance buffer strips and reduce directly connected impervious area water quality control detain the first 05 of runoff from the contributing watershed with detention per zone b and infiltration where conditions permit or provide equivalent treatment detain the first 05 of runoff from the contributing watershed for 24 hours or provide equivalent treatment provide sedimentation control within the drainage system bank erosion control rate of release shall be limited to 005 cfsunit per acre for a twoyear storm event none stormwater runoff shall not exceed the capacity of the downstream conveyance system flood control detention with infiltration when conditions permit release rate of 013 cfsunit per acre per kcdc rules release rate of 013 cfsunit per acre per kcdc rules direct conveyance of stormwater runoff within the capacity of downstream system  42803 resolution to implement performance and design standards the city commission of the city may adopt a resolution establishing more detailed design and performance standards for stormwater runoff facilities consistent with the terms of this chapter and in order to further implement its goals and purposes  42803 article ix  other matters

operator predates the uniform video services local franchise act and has rightofway management and related provisions however that act states that as of  any provisions of such an agreement inconsistent with or in addition to the standardized uniform form of franchise agreement established by the mpsc are deemed unreasonable and unenforceable c telecommunications providers who obtain a

providers with open comparable nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral access to the public rightsofway and may not discriminate against a video service provider for the authorization or placement of a video service or communications network in the public rightsofway h the michigan constitution reserves reasonable control of their highways streets alleys and public places to local units of government which may exercise such authority police powers i the purpose of this article is to promote and protect the public health safety and welfare and exercise reasonable control over the public rightsofway by regulating the use and occupation of such rightsofway by video service providers that lack a metro act permit from the city this article does so by setting forth terms and conditions for such usage and occupation from the forms of metro act permit approved by the mpsc and approved by the legislature in section 61 of the metro act thus providing open comparable nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral access to the public rightsofway and not discriminating against a video service provider for the authorization or placement of a video service or communications network in

without limitation mcla  and article vii  29 of the 1963 michigan constitution by 1 minimizing disruption of the public rightsofway by regulating the access to and ongoing use of the public rightsofway by telecommunications providers and the construction installation operation and use of facilities in the public rightsofway to provide telecommunication services  2 ensuring that the city and the public are protected from liability for use of the public rightsofway by telecommunications providers  3 providing for the payment of nondiscriminatory permit fees which do not exceed the fixed and variable costs of granting permits and maintaining the rightsofway used by telecommunications providers  and 4 assisting telecommunications providers in understanding the citys requirements for use of the public rightsofway and providing a fair and nondiscriminatory policy for permitting the use of the public rightsofway by such providers b after  the michigan metropolitan extension telecommunications rightsofway oversight act 2002 pa 48 act 48 is effective  in order to comply with the requirements of act 48 the city adopted to add chapter 81 telecommunicationsmetro act to the city code regarding permits for telecommunications providers issued on or after  however a number of the citys existing permits and consent agreements with telecommunications providers for use of the public rightsofway dated prior to  incorporate by reference all or portions of this chapter 80 under sections 42 and 51 of act 48 those existing permits and consent agreements continue in force and effect in accordance with their terms and conditions subject to section 13 of act 48 regarding fee modification and any other applicable sections of act 48 notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or the city code this chapter 80 shall after  remain in effect solely for the limited purpose of applying to those public rightsofway permits and consent agreements in existence before  except as otherwise provided in act 48 and for no other purpose except as otherwise provided in this subsection 2 this chapter 80 shall have no application to telecommunications providers after   2998   102802 reservation of rights the issuance of a permit or permits under this chapter and the access to and use of the public rightsofway by a telecommunications provider shall not constitute a waiver of or otherwise adversely affect the following reserved rights 1 right to require franchise  of the 1963 michigan constitution and the city charter require that all public utilities obtain a franchise to conduct a local business within the city the applicability of this requirement to telecommunications providers may be challenged under dd of the michigan telecommunications act which purports to define telecommunications services as not constituting public utility services due to this and other legal and regulatory issues and to avoid the expense and delay of litigation that may be unnecessary the city hereby determines that telecommunications providers shall not be required at this time to obtain franchises for the transaction of local business within the city telecommunications providers shall be required to obtain and maintain a permit for access to and ongoing use of the public rightsofway and to otherwise comply with the terms of this chapter such a permit shall not constitute a franchise the city reserves the right to require telecommunications providers to obtain a franchise in the future to transact local business within the city 2 rights regarding takings claim certain cable or telecommunications providers have initiated or supported legal proceedings in which they contend that federal law grants them the right to physically occupy the rightsofway and other property of a municipality for the purpose of providing telecommunications service without compensating the municipality for the use or value of the property so occupied or the cost of acquiring and maintaining such property municipalities dispute that claim the city believes that if such a claim were sustained it would among other things constitute an unlawful taking by the united states in violation of the fifth amendment of the united states constitution the legal issues involved in such disputes have not been finally decided the city desires to act on applications for permits granting access to its public rightsofway at this time rather than wait for determination of these issues provided this can be done without waiver or loss of any rights of the city or a permittee therefore notwithstanding any other provision hereof a permittee is not precluded by this chapter from seeking relief from the fee provisions of section 8010 from any court or agency of competent jurisdiction if a permittee seeks such relief the city reserves the right to assert a takings claim and to take all action it deems necessary in support thereof neither this chapter nor the issuance or acceptance of a permit hereunder constitutes or will be claimed to constitute a waiver or relinquishment of any rights or defenses of either the city or the permittee in connection with these disputed issues and the acceptance of a permit constitutes an acknowledgment and agreement thereto by the permittee 3 option to obtain consent agreement the city finds that legislative legal and regulatory issues in connection with use of the public rightsofway by telecommunications providers and the resulting potential for litigation and delay are likely to have an adverse impact on the development of a healthy competitive telecommunications infrastructure in the community this would be detrimental to the city and its residents as well as to telecommunications providers the issues affect among other things both the cost to telecommunications providers and compensation to the city for the maintenance and use of its public rightsofway in order to promote certainty encourage competition and avoid litigation the city will at the request and sole option of an applicant or permittee consider entering into a consent agreement for use of the public rightsofway for the provision of telecommunications services on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to the city and the telecommunications provider it is the citys intent that such an agreement would satisfy the

obstruct vision distract disorient or confuse drivers or pedestrians or are improperly secured or constructed 3 to conserve and enhance community character by reducing visual clutter which can arise due to excessive signage temporary signage or other signage that is improperly located or unreasonably distracting 4 to promote uniformity in the size number and placement of signs within districts 5

different in kind and character from larger offsite signs while reasonable regulations are likely to minimize adverse secondary effects from onsite digital and similar signage in terms of preserving the character and repose of adjacent areas protecting property values and reducing traffic hazards caused by undue distractions those same regulations regarding similar offsite signs will not sufficiently minimize such adverse secondary effects due to the latters sheer size visibility and nature b permits required a sign permit shall be required for the erection use construction or

3810   8 32811 billboards billboards are by their size and nature different in scope impact and purpose from other types of signage in the city among other matters billboards advertise or communicate goods services or messages not conducted sold or generated on the lot where the billboard is located billboards are significantly larger in size than other types of standalone signage allowed in the city and their principal purpose is to attract the attention of the travelling public and to divert that attention from the road the potential impact of a billboard on adjacent areas is significantly greater than other types of signage moreover the potential for distraction to motorists and pedestrians is greater than for other signs recently more businesses desire to utilize advancements in technology which allow signs including billboards to change copy electronically eg utilizing an led or digital type of sign these newer technologies exacerbate the potential negative impacts of a
