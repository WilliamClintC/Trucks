be established within the city and to pay for the design rightofway acquisition and construction or reconstruction of major and minor stormwater facilities to the extent that such costs have been determined to be the responsibility of developed properties all of the proceeds of this fee are deemed to be in payment for use of the city stormwater system by the real property on and with respect to which the charge is imposed on the owners    reestablishment of stormwater fees the city council may by resolution change the amount of the stormwater utility or basin fees for a stormwater basin based upon revised estimates of the cost of installing facilities in the basin any change in the amount of the stormwater basin fee shall be effective only as to properties in a stormwater basin which

incidental thereto if there are amounts in the fund in excess of the amount required to satisfy the purpose of the fund the city council may by ordinance authorize the transfer of such excess amount to any other fund of the city    property owners to provide stormwater facilities the city council further finds determines and declares under all attendant circumstances that the owners of property within stormwater basins in the city should provide the stormwater facilities necessary for the drainage and control of flood and surface waters within stormwater basins and should provide the facilities required to convey such waters from the stormwater basin to major drainage ways therefore the cost of installing stormwater facilities in a stormwater basin should be assessed in whole or in part against the lands in the stormwater basin the city council further finds determines and declares that all real property within a stormwater basin will be benefitted by the installation of stormwater facilities within the basin since the development of elevated lands increases the runoff of stormwaters from such lands causing increased amounts of stormwater to flow onto adjoining lands of lower elevation the owner of such elevated land has a duty to prevent such increased runoff from doing damage to other lands which duty will be met if adequate stormwater facilities are installed in the stormwater basin to the extent possible the charges assessed against lands in a stormwater basin for construction of stormwater facilities should take into account the amount of stormwater which will run off such lands after they have been developed    establishment of stormwater basins after receiving a report and recommendation from the director the water and sewer board shall officially adopt a stormwater map which is on file with the city delineating the boundaries of the stormwater basin in the city and in areas which may be annexed such map may also indicate existing

the city council in providing a reimbursement procedure under this provide an appropriate incentive for developers of private property to pay for the initial construction of water sewer and storm sewer systems to connect their property with existing public water sewer and storm sewer systems by providing a process whereby a developer can recoup a portion of the initial construction cost of such water sewer or storm sewer systems the city council also recognizes that it is necessary for a developer to timely apply to the city for reimbursement and further that there shall be a limitation on the period of time expressed in years whereby a developer may recoup his or her cost      conditions invoking eligibility for reimbursement for connections to public water sewer and storm sewer systems property benefitting from water sanitary sewer or storm sewer service can be either contiguous or noncontiguous to the system noncontiguous development requires the construction of offpremise mains offpremise mains are defined as mains constructed to serve a property which is not contiguous to existing water sewer and storm sewer systems and which cross other private property or properties excluded from this definition are water sewer and storm sewer systems in the interior of the property initially served storm water detention or retention facilities constructed solely for the benefit of the property initially served are also excluded from this definition the measurement of the offpremise systems shall be from the point of connection to the existing public system along such main to the point of connection for future line extensions or services all persons desiring water sewer and storm sewer service for property abutting or in the drainage area of an offpremise main shall be required to pay reimbursement if all of the following circumstances exist a the offpremises system was constructed in accordance with city specifications and requirements with prior approval of the city at the expense of one 1 or more private persons who have obtained approval for reimbursement from the water and sewer board pursuant to   b the person against whom the reimbursement is to be assessed requests approval for additional line extensions or services which connect to the offpremise system either directly or indirectly within ten 10 years of the completion of the construction the initial tenyear period may be renewed for an additional fiveyear period or periods by action of the water and sewer board upon petition by the person or persons who paid for such initial construction if such renewal petition is not filed prior to the lapse of an initial or renewal period such renewal shall not be allowed  the granting or denial of a renewal period shall be completely at the discretion of the city council the city council shall first consider the recommendation of the water and sewer board and such recommendation may only be overridden by a vote of five 5 members of the

the property owners against whom the reimbursement may be assessed were notified by the initial developer of their opportunity to participate in the cost of construction prior to the completion of construction with respect to all owners of property directly abutting the offpremise system such notification shall be by both certified and firstclass mail postage prepaid with respect to all owners of property not directly abutting the offpremise system but in the drainage area of such offpremise system such notification shall be in the form of signs as approved by the public works director announcing such opportunity erected at the intersection of the offpremises main with all public streets and roads and left standing at all times during construction of the offpremise system      computation of reimbursement for connection to public mains to be eligible for reimbursement for an initial tenyear period a developer must seek prior approval from the water and sewer board the area subject to the reimbursement procedure described in shall consist of land tracts which the water and sewer board determines benefit from the offpremise system costs shall be proportionally allocated by the water and sewer board to the land area on a frontage flow capacity drainage area or other equitable basis if all conditions are met the developers seeking reimbursement approval shall submit to the water and sewer board a proposed formula for approval the allocations shall be calculated on a gross acreage if allocated on a drainage area basis and shall include all rights of way storm water facilities parks and other private land which may be dedicated to public purposes within each tract in each case the reimbursement will be computed by prorating the construction cost without any additional charges other than interest against the property served by the offpremise system the reimbursement shall be paid prior to the approval of plans for construction of additional extensions or when service taps are requested whichever comes first an interest component may be added but shall apply to the first tenyear period only and not to subsequent periods and it shall be equal to that of tenyear us treasury bills at the completion of construction as evidenced by the date of final approval by the city council eligibility for reimbursement and reimbursement formulas after recommendation of the water and sewer board must have final approval of the city council such approval to be had by a majority of those members present and voting     reimbursement procedure for private payment

hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the health safety and general welfare of the public b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage     statement of purpose it is the purpose of this promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects

the subdivision process 1 the three 3 steps required to obtain approval of a subdivision are 1 sketch plana review of the feasibility of the project including conceptual design legal ability to obtain water and sanitation location of geologic hazards identification of environmentally sensitive areas and wildlife habitat areas locations of parks schools and open space source of required services vehicular and pedestrian circulation and conformance with the evans comprehensive plan and zoning requirements  2 preliminary plana review of preliminary technical engineering  and 3 final plata review of all final engineering and construction plans execution of subdivision agreements provision of a letter of credit or cash to secure the construction of the public improvements described in the subdivision agreement and other legal requirements 2 each step is a distinct process involving the submittal of an application an application fee required plans and reports referrals of the proposal to other agencies and public hearingsmeetings at each step of the process the level of design and engineering increases in order to relieve the applicant from major and potentially unnecessary expenses in situations that may require a redesign and therefore a revision of expensive engineering or planning reports approval at any step in the process does not ensure approval at the next step 3 the sketch plan shall be reviewed and approved by the planning commission at a public hearing prior to submittal of the preliminary plan the sketch plan and preliminary plan processes may be combined upon the prior approval of the community development director based upon but not limited to the following factors design size public concern public facilities services access and
