illinois find that the village of inverness cook county illinois the village is a home rule municipal corporation as provided in article vii section 6 of the 1970 constitution of the state of illinois and pursuant to said constitutional authority may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs for the protection of the public health safety morals and welfare b the village president and board of trustees further find that the availability of affordable housing in the village is a matter pertaining to the public health safety and welfare and therefore the adoption of plans ordinances regulations and other legislative and administrative actions to provide for the development of affordable housing are matters pertaining to the government and affairs of the village and consequently are within the constitutional grant of home rule authority to the village c the village president and board of trustees further find that the few areas where infrastructure for public sanitary sewers and a public water service might be available have already been developed and the remainder of the village has already fully been developed with singlefamily homes which are supported by private wells and individual sewage disposal systems and to support redevelopment of existing singlefamily homes or singlefamily lots for this purpose would unfairly impact existing homeowners and their respective neighborhoods and would create an environmental disaster in terms of the health and sanitation regulations of this code which govern the installation and maintenance of individual private sewage disposal systems d the village president and board of trustees further find that the state of illinois has enacted the affordable housing planning and appeal act public act 93595 effective  as amended by public act 93678 and as now or hereafter amended collectively the act which provides for the designation of particular municipalities in the state as either exempt or nonexempt based on the amount of housing in those municipalities determined under the act to be affordable requires nonexempt municipalities to develop and submit to the state on or before  an affordable housing plan and provides that beginning  developers who have been denied land use approvals by a nonexempt municipality may appeal such a decision to a state housing appeals board in order to seek relief from the decision e the village president and board of trustees further find that the village has been identified by the illinois housing development authority as a municipality that will be nonexempt under the act and therefore would but for this chapter be subject to the requirements of the act aforesaid including possible appeal of local land use decisions to the state housing appeals board f the village president and board of trustees further find that the act does not preempt home rule authority and that there is considerable uncertainty over provisions of the act governing local land use decisions and possible loss of local control over those decisions and that the public interest would be best served by the village not ceding its final authority over local land use decisions to a state board or commission g the village president and board of trustees further find that the act constitutes both an unfunded mandate the implementation of which would require local expenditures which will result in little if any local impact and a one size fits all approach that does not consider the unique circumstances of individual communities including but not limited to for example the fact that the village of inverness is fully developed the fact that the village has extremely limited infrastructure and the fact that a significant number of affordable housing units are available immediately adjacent to or within a short distance of the village of inverness h the village president and board of trustees further find that it is extremely unlikely that any reasonable opportunity for the development of affordable housing within the village will be identified in the foreseeable future given the continually increasing cost of land within the village which makes it prohibitive to implement i the village president and board of trustees further find that the village will give due consideration to any viable opportunity to accommodate new affordable housing options within the village in the unlikely event that any such opportunities are ever presented to develop or redevelop significant parcels for residential uses in the village of inverness  sterling codifiers inc  27366 for this purpose and the village pledges to work on a cooperative basis with any such proposed developers to facilitate the development of affordable housing in inverness consistent with the other well reasoned zoning planning and environmental policies of the village j the village president and board of trustees further find that the village as a home rule municipality has the authority to adopt ordinances and to promulgate ordinances rules and regulations that pertain to its government and affairs section 6a of the illinois constitution provides that    except as limited by this section a home rule unit may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs including but not limited to the power to regulate for the protection of the public health safety morals and welfare the act does not preempt home rule authority based on the following 1 in article 7 section 6m the illinois constitution specifically provides that powers and functions of home rule units shall be construed liberally 2 the general powers granted in section 6a continue in force even if the general assembly adopts less stringent or conflicting statutes so long as the general assembly does not preempt the use of home rule powers 3 the general assembly has not preempted the power of the village to except itself from the coverage of the act the act does not contain home rule preemption and the general assembly failed to approve the act by the threefifths 35 majority constitutionally required to preempt the powers of a home rule unit 4 the act does not supersede the powers of home rule units of local government 5 in kalodimos v village of morton grove 103 ill2d 483 502 470 ne2d 266 1984 the illinois supreme court found that home rule is predicated on the assumption that problems in which local governments have a legitimate and substantial interest should be open to local solution and reasonable experimentation to meet local needs free from veto by voters and elected representatives of other parts of the state who might disagree with the particular approach advanced by the representatives of the locality involved or fail to appreciate the local perception of the problem 6 the act does not supersede the powers of home rule units of local government 7 the act does not contain any express statement that affordable housing is purely a matter of statewide interest or give the state exclusive authority over affordable housing on the contrary the act provides that each nonexempt unit of local government establish its own plans and policies for achieving levels of affordable housing 8 the acts requirement of local based planning is inconsistent with the type of exclusive state control required for home rule preemption this inconsistency is apparent not only in the language of the act but also in the application of the act ihda was charged with the responsibility of determining which communities fell within the ambit of the act out of the one thousand two hundred ninety eight 1298 municipalities in the state ihda determined that the act applied only to forty nine 49 municipalities or municipalities constituting approximately 47 percent of the states population based on the 2000 census all of the nonexempt communities identified by ihda are in cook lake dupage will mchenry or kane counties not one is downstate ihdas determination further validates that affordable housing is not purely a matter of statewide interest or concern 9 the act does not specifically limit local governments concurrent exercise of municipal planning development and zoning power or specifically declare the states exercise of those powers under the act to be exclusive rather the opposite is true the act requires the local exercise of authority and discretion in establishing plans and implementing regulations relating to affordable housing 10 there is no indication in the act that the provision of affordable housing and the acts attendant derogation of local land use planning and zoning regulations are not a subject within a home rule units government and affairs 11 the house floor debate on the act contains numerous statements and representations by the acts sponsor representative sloane that the act was not intended to apply to home rule units of local government k the village president and board of trustees further find that compliance by the village of inverness with the act is impractical and is not in the best interests of the village l the village president and board of trustees further find that the village of inverness comprehensively regulates planning zoning and development within its boundaries m the village president and board of trustees further find that the village also intends that pursuant to the provisions of this chapter all decisions about inverness housing needs and future development will continue to be made at the local level and not be subject to appeal to a state board or commission n the village president and board of trustees further find that based on all the foregoing the village intends this chapter to constitute the total comprehensive and exclusive regulation of the subject matter of affordable housing within the village of inverness generally by the village in the exercise of the villages home rule authority notwithstanding any provision of the act and that this chapter shall totally displace and preempt the act and all its provisions as permitted under the villages constitutional home rule authority 4122 purpose and policy this chapter codifies the villages abrogation of the act and any amendments thereto within the corporate limits of the village the village board of trustees has specifically found since the village is fully developed and that it comprehensively regulates planning zoning and development within its corporate limits that the villages compliance with the act and any amendments thereto is impractical and not in the best interests of the health safety and welfare of the village the village board of trustees has determined that the act shall not apply within the corporate limits of the village the village will give due consideration to any viable opportunity to accommodate new affordable housing within the village when opportunities are presented to develop or redevelop significant parcels for residential use within the village consistent with the other well reasoned zoning planning and environmental policies of the village 4123 exercise of home rule

and board of trustees of the village of inverness cook county illinois find that the village of inverness cook county illinois the village is a home rule municipal corporation as provided in article vii section 6 of the 1970 constitution of the state of illinois and pursuant to said constitutional authority may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs for the protection of the public health safety morals and welfare b the village president and board of trustees further find that the availability of affordable housing in the village is a matter pertaining to the public health safety and welfare and therefore the adoption of plans ordinances regulations and other legislative and administrative actions to provide for the development of affordable housing are matters pertaining to the government and affairs of the village and consequently are within the constitutional grant of home rule authority to the village c the village president and board of trustees further find that the few areas where infrastructure for public sanitary sewers and a public water service might be available have already been developed and the remainder of the village has already fully been developed with singlefamily homes which are supported by private wells and individual sewage disposal systems and to support redevelopment of existing singlefamily homes or singlefamily lots for this purpose would unfairly impact existing homeowners and their respective neighborhoods and would create an environmental disaster in terms of the health and sanitation regulations of this code which govern the installation and maintenance of individual private sewage disposal systems d the village president and board of trustees further find that the state of illinois has enacted the affordable housing planning and appeal act public act 93595 effective  as amended by public act 93678 and as now or hereafter amended collectively the act which provides for the designation of particular municipalities in the state as either exempt or nonexempt based on the amount of housing in those municipalities determined under the act to be affordable requires nonexempt municipalities to develop and submit to the state on or before  an affordable housing plan and provides that beginning  developers who have been denied land use approvals by a nonexempt municipality may appeal such a decision to a state housing appeals board in order to seek relief from the decision e the village president and board of trustees further find that the village has been identified by the illinois housing development authority as a municipality that will be nonexempt under the act and therefore would but for this chapter be subject to the requirements of the act aforesaid including possible appeal of local land use decisions to the state housing appeals board f the village president and board of trustees further find that the act does not preempt home rule authority and that there is considerable uncertainty over provisions of the act governing local land use decisions and possible loss of local control over those decisions and that the public interest would be best served by the village not ceding its final authority over local land use decisions to a state board or commission g the village president and board of trustees further find that the act constitutes both an unfunded mandate the implementation of which would require local expenditures which will result in little if any local impact and a one size fits all approach that does not consider the unique circumstances of individual communities including but not limited to for example the fact that the village of inverness is fully developed the fact that the village has extremely limited infrastructure and the fact that a significant number of affordable housing units are available immediately adjacent to or within a short distance of the village of inverness h the village president and board of trustees further find that it is extremely unlikely that any reasonable opportunity for the development of affordable housing within the village will be identified in the foreseeable future given the continually increasing cost of land within the village which makes it prohibitive to implement i the village president and board of trustees further find that the village will give due consideration to any viable opportunity to accommodate new affordable housing options within the village in the unlikely event that any such opportunities are ever presented to develop or redevelop significant parcels for residential uses in the village of inverness for this purpose and the village pledges to work on a cooperative basis with any such proposed developers to facilitate the development of affordable housing in inverness consistent with the other well reasoned zoning planning and environmental policies of the village j the village president and board of trustees further find that the village as a home rule municipality has the authority to adopt ordinances and to promulgate ordinances rules and regulations that pertain to its government and affairs section 6a of the illinois constitution provides that    except as limited by this section a home rule unit may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs including but not limited to the power to regulate for the protection of the public health safety morals and welfare the act does not preempt home rule authority based on the following 1 in article 7 section 6m the illinois constitution specifically provides that powers and functions of home rule units shall be construed liberally 2 the general powers granted in section 6a continue in force even if the general assembly adopts less stringent or conflicting statutes so long as the general assembly does not preempt the use of home rule powers 3 the general assembly has not preempted the power of the village to except itself from the coverage of the act the act does not contain home rule preemption and the general assembly failed to approve the act by the threefifths 35 majority constitutionally required to preempt the  sterling codifiers inc  170366 powers of a home rule unit 4 the act does not supersede the powers of home rule units of local government 5 in kalodimos v village of morton grove 103 ill2d 483 502 470 ne2d 266 1984 the illinois supreme court found that home rule is predicated on the assumption that problems in which local governments have a legitimate and substantial interest should be open to local solution and reasonable experimentation to meet local needs free from veto by voters and elected representatives of other parts of the state who might disagree with the particular approach advanced by the representatives of the locality involved or fail to appreciate the local perception of the problem 6 the act does not supersede the powers of home rule units of local government 7 the act does not contain any express statement that affordable housing is purely a matter of statewide interest or give the state exclusive authority over affordable housing on the contrary the act provides that each nonexempt unit of local government establish its own plans and policies for achieving levels of affordable housing 8 the acts requirement of local based planning is inconsistent with the type of exclusive state control required for home rule preemption this inconsistency is apparent not only in the language of the act but also in the application of the act ihda was charged with the responsibility of determining which communities fell within the ambit of the act out of the one thousand two hundred ninety eight 1298 municipalities in the state ihda determined that the act applied only to forty nine 49 municipalities or municipalities constituting approximately 47 percent of the states population based on the 2000 census all of the nonexempt communities identified by ihda are in cook lake dupage will mchenry or kane counties not one is downstate ihdas determination further validates that affordable housing is not purely a matter of statewide interest or concern 9 the act does not specifically limit local governments concurrent exercise of municipal planning development and zoning power or specifically declare the states exercise of those powers under the act to be exclusive rather the opposite is true the act requires the local exercise of authority and discretion in establishing plans and implementing regulations relating to affordable housing 10 there is no indication in the act that the provision of affordable housing and the acts attendant derogation of local land use planning and zoning regulations are not a subject within a home rule units government and affairs 11 the house floor debate on the act contains numerous statements and representations by the acts sponsor representative sloane that the act was not intended to apply to home rule units of local government k the village president and board of trustees further find that compliance by the village of inverness with the act is impractical and is not in the best interests of the village l the village president and board of trustees further find that the village of inverness comprehensively regulates planning zoning and development within its boundaries m the village president and board of trustees further find that the village also intends that pursuant to the provisions of this chapter all decisions about inverness housing needs and future development will continue to be made at the local level and not be subject to appeal to a state board or commission n the village president and board of trustees further find that based on all the foregoing the village intends this chapter to constitute the total comprehensive and exclusive regulation of the subject matter of affordable housing within the village of inverness generally by the village in the exercise of the villages home rule authority notwithstanding any provision of the act and that this chapter shall totally displace and preempt the act and all its provisions as permitted under the villages constitutional home rule authority  4122 purpose and policy this chapter codifies the villages abrogation of the act and any amendments thereto within the corporate limits of the village the village board of trustees has specifically found since the village is fully developed and that it comprehensively regulates planning zoning and development within its corporate limits that the villages compliance with the act and any amendments thereto is impractical and not in the best interests of the health safety and welfare of the village the village board of trustees has determined that the act shall not apply within the corporate limits of the village the village will give due consideration to any viable opportunity to accommodate new affordable housing within the village when opportunities are presented to develop or redevelop significant parcels for residential use within the village consistent with the other well reasoned zoning planning and

ill reg 243 effective  illustration g instructions for conducting percolation tests percolation tests shall not be made in frozen ground or ground that has been filled in the preceding 12 months percolation tests shall be performed in accordance with the following procedures 1 number and location of percolation tests select an area where the seepage field will be located when digging the holes avoid animal burrows large root channels etc at least 3 separate percolation tests shall be performed at the site of each proposed disposal area the percolation test holes shall be at least 50 feet apart at least one hole shall be located at the lowest elevation of the proposed absorption field area the 2 holes with the highest results shall be used to determine percolation rate 2 depth of percolation test hole dig or bore the holes with horizontal dimensions approximately 4 to 6 inches in diameter to the depth of the proposed seepage field or seepage bed 3 preparation of test hole a carefully pick the bottom and sides of the hole with a knife blade or sharp pointed instrument to remove smeared or smoothed soil and to provide a natural soil interface into which water may percolate b remove all loose material from the hole c add 2 inches of coarse gravel to protect the bottom from scouring and sediment a removable hardware cloth screen to line the lower part of the hole also helps prevent sloughing of the hole sides during testing 4 saturation and swelling of soil it is important to distinguish between saturation and swelling saturation means the void spaces between soil particles are full of water this can be accomplished in a very short period of time swelling is caused by the intrusion of water into the individual soil particle this is a slow process especially in a clay type soil and is the reason for requiring a prolonged soaking period a on the day prior to conducting the percolation test carefully fill the hole with water and keep it full for at least 4 hours the percolation test shall be conducted on the day following this presoaking at least 18 hours after presoaking is completed but prior to 30 hours after presoaking is completed cover the hole during this 18  30 hour waiting period in sandy soils with greater than 70% sand and less than 15% clay sand and loamy sand after the 4 hour presoak a percolation test may be attempted without the 18 hour waiting period if the percolation test results are greater than 45 minutes for a 6 inch drop in water the test must be repeated after the 18 hour waiting period if the percolation test results are 45 minutes or less the percolation rate shall be used to size the system b on the day of conducting the percolation test carefully fill the hole with water to 12 inches above the gravel c allow the water level to drop to a point 6 inches above the gravel if the water does not fall from 12 inches to 6 inches in 6 hours the percolation test is terminated and an alternate system is required d measure the last 6 inch drop in water level at thirty minute intervals until all the water has seeped away warning under no conditions shall measurements be taken from water filled to the top of the hole or on water 12 inches deep in the hole such results are completely invalid and will not be accepted results from the last 6 inches of drop in water are the only results that will be accepted 5 recording of results record results of all tests as the total minutes required for the last 6 inches of seepage if the last 6 inches of water has not seeped away at the end of 6 hours the soil must be considered unsuitable for seepage field disposal and the appropriate statement marked on the results form if there is more than a 30 minute difference between the highest 2 percolation tests use the larger result or perform additional percolation tests 6 calculating the percolation rate add the total minutes required for the last 6 inches of water to fall from the 2 holes with the highest result and divide by 2 if the average is less than 60 minutes use the percolation rate of 60 minutes if the average is greater than 60 minutes refer to illustration h of this appendix locate in the first column time minutes required for last 6 inches of water to fall where the highest 2 hole average fits and use the next highest result as the percolation rate for sizing and design an example of this procedure is as follows if 3 percolation tests are conducted with results of 120 minutes 140 minutes and 155 minutes the highest 2 hole average would be 140 + 1552 or 1475 minutes looking at illustration h of this appendix the next highest result would be 150 minutes the 150 minute rate would be used to size and design the subsurface seepage system 7 distribution of results the results of the percolation tests shall be given to the homeowner and shall be retained by the contractor for at least 5 years the percolation test data report shall be returned to the appropriate regional office

foot is equal to the average inside width of the chamber times an equivalency factor of 25 for example a chamber that has an average inside width of 125 feet provides an equivalent absorption area of  square feet per linear foot 125 feet times the 25 equivalency factor equals  square feet per linear foot to determine the length of chambers required first calculate the absorption area required for a gravel system based on illustration h exhibit a or illustration m exhibit a of this appendix then divide this area by the equivalent chamber absorption area per linear foot for example if a 3 bedroom house requires 870 square feet of absorption field and chambers 125 feet wide are being used then the length of chambers needed is 278 feet 870 square feet divided by  square feet per linear foot
