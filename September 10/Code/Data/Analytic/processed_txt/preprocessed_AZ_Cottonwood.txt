life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in special flood hazard areas which increase flood heights and velocities when obstructions are inadequately anchored this may cause damage in other areas uses that are inadequately flood proofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to flood loss c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare it is also the purpose of this chapter to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize

special flood hazard areas that they assume responsibility for their actions  9 participate in and maintain eligibility for flood insurance and disaster relief d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development activities which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in

variance criteria set forth in this section of this chapter is based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertaining to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners a variance cannot be selfcaused it is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are extremely rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b floodplain review board 1 the city council acting as the floodplain board may establish a board of review which may be the advisory board or a committee of the advisory board to sit in review and make decisions if the city council in its capacity as the floodplain board does not establish a separate floodplain review board then the city council in its capacity as the floodplain board shall act as the floodplain review board 2 the floodplain review board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter 3 in considering such applications the floodplain review board shall consider all technical evaluations relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and 4 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  5 the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  6 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  7 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  8 the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  9 the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  10 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  11 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  12 the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  13 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  14 the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water system and streets and bridges 15 upon consideration of the factors of b3 and the purposes of this chapter the floodplain review board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter 16 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice by the floodplain administrator that 17 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the regulatory flood elevation may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage or more  and 18 such construction below the regulatory flood elevation increases risks to life and property  19 the land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of state land pursuant to the flood relocation and land exchange program provided by ars  37610 a copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 20 the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance c conditions for variances 1 variances shall only be issued a upon a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances  b for the repair rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure  c upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief  d upon a showing of good and sufficient cause  e upon a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  andor f upon a showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water this includes only facilities defined in this chapter in the definition of functionally dependent use 2 variances shall not be issued within any floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 3 generally variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the regulatory flood elevation provided the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases  9152015 statutory references for arizona cities and towns the statutory references listed below refer the code

ars title 49 light pollution  491101 et seq is hereby incorporated by reference b mission statement to afford every citizen of cottonwood the flexibility to engage in the pursuit of safe inexpensive lighting practices for the purpose of commerce and private use without being impeded upon or impeding upon other citizens desiring a more pristine night time environment free from light pollution waste trespass or clutter while providing nighttime safety security and productivity c purpose and intent 1 the use of outdoor lighting is often necessary for adequate nighttime safety and utility but common lighting practices can also interfere with other legitimate public concerns principle among these concerns are 1 the degradation of the nighttime visual environment by production of unsightly and dangerous glare 2 unnecessary waste of energy and resources in the production of too much light or wasted light 3 interference in the use or enjoyment of property which is not intended to be illuminated at night and 4 the loss of the oftenneglected scenic view of the heavens due to increased urban skyglow it is hereby recognized that these different interests those of safety and utility and those of aesthetic appearance need not compete good modern lighting practices can provide adequate light for safety and utility without excessive glare or light pollution in nearly all cases careful attention to questions of when and where and how much nighttime lighting is needed will lead to better lighting practice from all viewpoints 2 it is also recognized that the topography and atmospheric conditions in northern arizona are uniquely suited for government military commercial and private astronomical observation in the area and that unnecessary or excessive uses of outdoor nighttime lighting have an adverse impact on astronomical observation even at relatively distant observatories 3 accordingly it is the intent of this encourage lighting practices and systems which will minimize light pollution glare light trespass and conserve energy while maintaining nighttime safety utility security and productivity d conflicting regulations in the event of conflict between the regulations set forth in this any other regulations applicable to the same area the more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern 102 e approved materials and methods of construction or
