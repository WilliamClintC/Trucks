increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature  b diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants  c alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loading  d reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading  e threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities  and f undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding g increases the publics cost

turner road across from the platter restaurant the president of prentice inc is mr thomas trudeau of trudeau construct located in bayfield wisconsin the property is described as govt lot #2 t47n r4w in ashland zoning the property is currently zoned as agricultural the land use plan designates the property to be rezoned in the future as suburban residential the suburban residential zoning requires a minimum lot size of at least v% acre the property owner has applied for a planned unit development pud designation for the project in general the pud designation allows the city and the developer to negotiate higher density mixed uses or development clustering in exchange for open space areas public amenities or protection of unique land characteristics the development proposal includes a request for mixed residential uses that would not normally be allowed under standard suburban residential zoning in exchange the project attempts to leave drainage ravines largely undisturbed tries to maintain scenic vistas of lake superior and reduces the number of building units from the number that would normally be allowed under standard suburban residential zoning site plan a detailed site plan based on a certified survey has been prepared showing the precise location and size of all proposed lots in addition the plan shows the following land uses and development densities size arrangement and location of all lots location of all buildings location of all public and private streets artesian well location locations of mature trees and vegetation locations of wetland areas site topography and drainage patterns rear yard setbacks for lots located on the south border of the project building set backs the rear yard set back for lots on the south side of the development will be at least 35 feet the 35 foot set back will be shown on the site plan wetlands the location of all known wetlands on the property will be shown on the site plan all wetlands areas will be undisturbed by the development a 20foot buffer zone will be provided around wetland areas development density the plan provides for the construction of 21 residential dwelling units on 14 lots the residential mix will include 1 sixunit condominium 2 twounit villas and 11 single family homes the plan asks for flexibility to change the use of the sixunit condominium site to a twounit villa if the market is stronger for villas the city of ashland will not permit the construction of additional condominium units other than the units shown on prentice heights plat f public improvements all public improvements in the housing development will be constructed to specifications established by the city of ashland the city engineer will oversee all design of public utilities and public improvements and will serve as the construction inspector for the project perhaps the most significant public improvement on the site will be the drainage plan natural drainage ravines and swales will remain largely unchanged as part of the design of the drainage plan a complete hydraulic analysis of surface water runoff will be done the hydraulic analysis will include documented information from usgs maps and undocumented features including artesian wells and upstream drainage impacts as a minimum the culverts will be sized to meet the water discharge created from a 25year storm the project will be served by a new sanitary sewer line that will be installed under or adjacent to the new city street the 8inch sewer line will flow by gravity to a main line located on turner road the turner road sewer main discharges into the turner road lift station which has sufficient capacity to accept the additional flows it is anticipated that private wells will be installed to provide water to the residential units however before construction the city engineer will complete a study to determine the feasibility of extending municipal water service from sanborn avenue to the project the developer proposes the construction of a new city street named prentice heights road the street will be built to city construction standards and will include curb and gutter a culdesac with a turn radius sufficient to meet the needs of emergency vehicles will be provided the vertical alignment of the public road will be controlled by the buildings finished floor elevations and the depth of public utilities the city may choose to delay the placement of asphalt on the road bed if there is concern about additional trench settling or high water content in the road base the delay in placing asphalt will not exceed one year from the completion of street base improvements electric and gas service will be extended to the lots prior to the completion of street construction no excavation materials or spoils materials from the project shall be deposited in ravines or negatively impact natural drainage patterns protection of vistas every effort will be made to protect or possibly enhance the view of lake superior for properties located south of the development each of the dwelling structures will be limited to single story construction as viewed from the street the only exception to this standard will be the sixunit condominium which will have four units on the main floor and two units on a second story each structure will be constructed with a 612 roof pitch some trees on the north border of the development may be removed or pruned in a way to enhance views for existing or proposed housing erosion control plan all slopes will be left untouched as much as possible as a minimum measure contractors will be required to place filter cloth and hay bales to control soil erosion additional measures to control erosion will be provided if the city engineer deems necessary all disturbed areas will be seeded and mulched after construction landscaping plan a color rendering of a site plan has been prepared to give an overall impression of the expected landscaping improvements to the site to the extent possible existing vegetation will be left untouched especially in the ravine and swale areas the goal of the landscaping plan will be to minimize the area utilized for manicured lawn developed grass and green space areas will be primarily limited to the areas immediately adjacent to the building areas and driveways a variety of shrubs and bushes will be used as selective screening between some of the building sites restrictive covenants declarations of restrictions and covenants will be provided for the development the restrictive covenants will not be less restrictive that requirements imposed by the city by will not be less restrictive than any formal condition attached to the approval of the development by the planning commission or city council the restrictive covenants will provide for an architectural review comrnittee to be formed membership on the review committee will include property owners as lots are sold with the review committee being comprising all of the owners of property at the completion of the development the city of ashland will be provided with a copy of the final version of restrictive covenants before construction and executed copies of the restrictive covenants will be provided to the city as lots are sold property values the general sale price of the condominium units will be in the low $100000 range villas will be marketed for approximately $150000 each and single family home values are expected to range from $140000 to $200000 main floor square footage for the housing units will be at least 1200 square feet timetable for development the length of time of the development will greatly depend on the sales of the lots construction of the public improvements are expected to begin by the late spring or early summer of 1997 construction of any housing is expected to begin during the middle part of summer 1997 it is anticipated that the project will be completely built out within approximately three years fencing assuming that the existing fence between adjoining property owners and the development property is properly located on the property boundary such fence shall remain intact and undisturbed however if the fence is not located properly the developer and the property owner will need to resolve the boundary issues pager 807b1 chapter 807b an ordinance to approve a pudgdp planned unit
