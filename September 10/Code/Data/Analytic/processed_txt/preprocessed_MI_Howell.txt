there are areas within the city where the intent is to place greater emphasis on regulating urban form and character of development as well as use and intensity of use the city also intends to encourage development by allowing a flexible mix of uses while requiring specific development standards that will provide a more compact walkable environment the formbased districts are intended to implement the vision goals and objectives of the city of howell master plan and any other applicable plans in addition to the general standards applicable to all formbased districts there are specific standards applicable to each district bpurpose the general purpose of these regulations is as follows 1promote new investment opportunities by allowing a wide range of potential uses and techniques to expand the employment and economic base 2ensure that development is designed for people in cars as well as on foot or bike creates attractive streetscapes and pedestrian spaces 3promote mixeduse development in both a horizontal and vertical form 4ensure reasonable transition between higher intensity development and adjacent neighborhoods 5increase options for people driving walking or biking to reach their destinations and reduce the need for onsite parking 6provide a more predictable development approval process cfactors for regulation these regulations are based on two 2 significant factors site context and building form 1site context is derived from existing and desired characteristics of an area and recognizes the inherent conditions of the areas where these regulations are applied sites are categorized by shape size orientation and location sites are also characterized by the type of street upon which the property is located 2building form addresses the manner in which buildings and structures relate to their lots surrounding buildings and street frontage the shape of the building the land area to volume ratio and the orientation of the building has a significant impact upon the character of an area building form standards control height placement building configuration parking location and ground story activation applicable to the site context 3regulations are tailored to meet a more specific intent of each district these districts and intents are set forth elsewhere in this applicability and organization aapplicability 1any new use or expansion of existing use that requires site plan review shall comply with the requirements of this other applicable requirements of this 2the requirements of this not apply to acontinuation of a permitted use

residential use and for smaller nonresidential use which is compatible with a residential setting site type a is generally located in areas which serve as a transition between the street and neighboring residential areas the building form selected for these sites must consider both the front elevation that fronts on the street but also the rearside elevation that is adjacent to residential in order to maintain compatibility with adjacent uses 2site type b small commercialoffice or mixed use sites made up mostly of lots in the onehalf 05 acre and smaller range the site type b category is reserved for the smallest singleuse sites developed for free standing commercial and office or mixed use developments site type b size and character may vary based on the unique characteristic of each parcel small retail and foodservice uses would often be found in this category as well as small multitenant office buildings or singletenant office buildings site type b sites must be designed to better integrate with their surroundings to contribute to a more cohesive district a more consistent building line and more efficient access between sites access for pedestrians and cross access for vehicles will help sites in this category reduce trips entering and existing from corridors and arterials when located at corners the buildings should frame and enhance street corners use of architecturally prominent features at the corners or prominent three dimensional site improvements fountains towers sculpture art etc groups of site type b properties may make excellent candidates for assembly to create more cohesive development projects 3site type c medium commercialoffice and mixed use sites the sites in site type c are mostly between onehalf 05 and two 2 acres in area and are located at the edges of larger site type d sites site type c size and character may vary based on the unique characteristic of each parcel this category can include free standing singleuse developments situated nearby one another  however the site type c category should be designed to consider of integration of adjacent parcels integration will allow for better interaction between users which could lead to a more readily shared customer and tenant base and could help reduce city traffic the setback and orientation of the buildings in site type c should be situated as to reinforce a consistent building line with minor variations primary building entries public areas administration areas and windows should be visible oriented and accessible from the primary street and parking facilities when located at corners the buildings should frame and enhance street corners use of architecturally prominent features at the corners or prominent three dimensional site improvements fountains towers sculpture art etc 4site type d large scale regional sites site type d properties are greater than two 2 acres in area but designed to function as one unit site type d size and character may vary based on the unique characteristic of each parcel walkability within and between sites and provision of supporting buildings and uses are important to the success of the very large site type d developments they should be designed with a mix of uses in mind to allow for users to obtain basic services on or immediately near the site especially within large office centers where hundreds of workers may populate the site during the day restaurants postal facilities and other daily needs should be integrated within existing buildings or permitted to exist in smaller outlot developments or nearby developments in site type a or b or c categories site design should strongly focus on putting the densest components of the project within close range of the primary rightofway to combat the vast open areas that frequently make such sites difficult or undesirable for pedestrians the development of these sites is often phased the phasing must include consistent building form treatment cbuilding form standards 1the mixeduse districts permit a series of building forms dependent on the site context the building forms set forth in tables 4a03c are established in this section as follows 2building forms are designated within each district location based on the regulating plan building forms are classified in the following manner apermitted
