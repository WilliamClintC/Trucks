commission shall not allow a crossconnection to exist within the public water supply system unless it is considered necessary and all appropriate approvals and permits have been issued  889 existing backflow prevention devices any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the commission to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health where the degree of hazard has increased as in the case of a residential installation converting to a business establishment any existing backflow preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure backflow preventer or a reduced pressure backflow preventer must be installed in the event that no backflow device was present  8810 periodic testing required the owner of any residential premises having a private well or other private water source will not be allowed a physical connection with the public water

necessary upon completion of the repair the device will be retested at the owners expense to ensure proper operation highhazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately in other situations a compliance date of not more than 14 days after the test date will be established the owner is responsible for spare parts repair tools or a replacement device parallel installation of two devices is an effective means of the owner ensuring that uninterrupted water service remains during testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such continuity e backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than specified above in in cases where there is a history of test failures and the commission feels that due to the degree of hazard involved additional testing is warranted cost of the additional tests will be borne by the owner f records the commission will initiate and maintain the following 1 master files on customer crossconnection tests andor inspections 2 master files on approved crossconnection installations copies of lists and summaries supplied

at a time a  8810 westminster code  8812   8813 strainers the commission strongly recommends that all new and retrofit installations of reduced pressure backflow preventers and double check valve assemblies include the installation of strainers located immediately upstream of the backflow device the installation of strainers will preclude the fouling of backflow devices due to both foreseen and unforeseen circumstances occurring to the water supply system such as water main repairs water main breaks fires periodic cleaning and flushing of mains etc these occurrences may stir up debris within the water main that will cause fouling of backflow devices installed without the benefit of strainers  8814 fee structure the initial backflow prevention device test is $50 all repeat tests are

directly connected impervious surfaces throughout the proposed development b following is a list of bmps which may be utilized and minimum guidelines for their design vegetated swales swales should have side slopes equal to or greater than three feet horizontal to one foot vertical and be constructed at minimum slopes to reduce flow velocities and encourage infiltration the swales should only hold water during and immediately after rainfall events and should be planted with vegetation suitable for soil stabilization stormwater treatment and nutrient uptake the water quality benefits

cigarette smoking is the chief preventable cause of death in our society  smoking is the most important health issue of our time a each year an estimated 350000 americans will die prematurely from the effects of smoking millions more live with crippled lungs and overstrained hearts cigarette smoking is a major cause of emphysema lung cancer chronic bronchitis and heart disease b furthermore tobacco smoke pollutes air in enclosed places and affects nonsmokers who are present 1 inhaling secondhand smoke makes the heart beat faster the blood pressure go up and the level of carbon monoxide in the blood increase 2 there is more cadmium in the smoke that drifts off the burning end of tobacco products than in the drag the smoker takes large doses of cadmium have been related to hypertension chronic bronchitis and emphysema 3 smoke from an idling cigarette contains even more tar and nicotine than an inhaled one 4 the amount of carbon monoxide in the blood of nonsmokers doubles in a poorlyventilated room filled with tobacco smoke even outside the room the inhaled carbon monoxide stays in the body for three or four hours 5 the nonsmoker is forced to breathe in smoke from the burning end of the cigarette as well as the smoke exhaled by the smoker 6 researchers have found that respiratory infections especially pneumonia and acute bronchitis are twice as common in young children whose parents smoke at home compared to those with nonsmoking parents 7 the united states surgeon general has said nonsmokers have as much right to clean air and wholesome air as smokers have their socalled right to smoke which i would redefine as a socalled right to pollute it is high time to ban smoking from all confined public places such as restaurants theaters airplanes trains and buses it is time that we interpret the bill of rights for the nonsmoker as well as the smoker 8 c  2481 portable bathrooms  2482   2482 definitions for the purpose of these regulations the following
