references sewers  see ch 143 sewer line extensions  see ch 325 user charges  see ch 330  3051 purpose and scope a the purpose of this chapter is to outline the methodology employed by the ellington water pollution control authority wpca in determining the sewer benefit assessments levied against those commercial and  220113 ellington code  3051  residential property owners especially benefited by the installation of a sanitary sewer system serving the crystal lake area b the crystal lake sewerage system was constructed to eliminate the public health hazards of undersized onlot disposal systems and raw wastewater discharges which occurred in this area the construction of the sewerage system was determined by the wpca to be the only feasible alternative to correcting this problem due to a large degree to the density of the dwelling units in the community c the sewer system has and will preserve the quality of crystal lake as well as the health and safety of the individual properties of which provide a special additional benefit to each property served the density and existing lot sizes in most cases precluded the repair replacement or construction of new onlot systems these same factors necessitated the development of a benefit assessment policy unique to the crystal lake area  3052 determination of benefit assessments a in determining the factors to be used in the determination of the benefit assessments the wpca evaluated the factors which it considered unique to the crystal lake area among these factors the following were considered to be significant 1 the crystal lake sewerage system was constructed to serve residential and to a small extent commercial uses around crystal lake permitted uses of property in the sewer service area as determined application of the town of ellingtons zoning regulations24 are for the most part singlefamily residential and in a limited area lake residence zone the lake residence zone as defined in  23011 of the town of ellington zoning regulations permits yearround singlefamily dwellings and seasonal use of singlefamily dwellings the wpca has assumed that the permitted use of the property has to be taken into account in the determination of the assessed value of the property by the tax assessor 2 the topography of the area necessitated the construction of a sewerage collection system which used both gravity sewers and lowpressure grinder pump sewers slightly more than 13 of all of the initial units served by the system required grinder pump service 3 the nature of the crystal lake community was initially that of several lakeside associations of summer cottages many of these dwelling units were constructed on lots of minimal size with little or no frontage on private roads over the years many of these cottages have been converted to yearround use b given the above factors the wpca has determined that the following items shall be used in the determination of sewer benefit assessments 1 a unit charge for each dwelling unit served by the sewerage system 2 a value charge based on the assessed value of each property served by the sewerage system 24editors note see ch 230 zoning  3051 water  3052  3 a connection charge which shall reflect the benefit of a towninstalled lateral connection to the collection system  3053 calculation of residential charge amended 1222008 a the sewer benefit assessment charge for residential property shall be the sum of the following two factors 1 unit charge new singlefamily and multifamily dwellings shall be assessed $3125 per bedroom  additions shall be assessed $3125 per bedroom for increased bedrooms of four or more or as set by the wpca after a public hearing 2 connection charge in addition to and in recognition of the further benefit conferred upon property where a connection has been joined to the sewer line to serve the property a connection charge of $1000 per connection shall be made a in the event of a future connection to the system whether by gravity or pressure system the connection charge shall be levied only if the future user connects to a lateral installed as part of the original construction of the system no connection charges shall be levied against future users who construction their own connection to the main lines of the system b multipledwellingunit structures shall be charged one connection charge for each connection to the sewerage system  3054 calculation of commercial charge a hotels motels rooming houses and bedandbreakfast operations all properties classified as commercial or mixed use residential commercial by the office of the ellington tax assessor shall be assessed application of the previously presented residential property formula see  3053a1 2 and 3 plus 14 of the existing residential unit charge for each additional unit b commercial properties this classification is intended to include all commercially classified properties with the exception of restaurants hotels motels rooming houses and bedandbreakfast operations 1 commercial properties shall be assessed a value charge connection charge and a unit charge value charge in addition and in recognition of the greater benefit conferred upon larger more valuable structures an assessment of 375% of the cost of construction as determined by the building department using the cost factors for building permits shall be made connection charges shall be as stated in  3053a2 commercial unit charges shall be $2200 for the first unit and  of the commercial unit charge for each additional commercial unit or fraction thereof for the purpose of this assessment formula a commercial unit is defined as 2500 square feet of commercial space amended 1222008 2 in the case of mixeduse properties residentialcommercial the residential formula shall be applied to the property first with the commercial unit charges applied subsequently c restaurants  3052 ellington code  3054  1 all properties classified as restaurants shall be assessed a value charge and connection charges as presented within the residential section of this chapter see  3053a1 2 and 3 plus a restaurant unit charge of $2200 for the first unit plus 12 of the restaurant unit charge for each additional unit or fraction thereof for the purpose of this assessment formula a restaurant unit is defined as each block of 12 persons the restaurant is permitted to seat as defined by the permit issued by the ellington fire marshal 2 in the case of mixeduse properties residentialrestaurant the residential formula shall be applied to the property first with the restaurant unit charges applied subsequently  3055 vacant land vacant land shall not be assessed by the wpca until such time as it is built upon and derives a direct benefit from the sewerage system owners of vacant land may approach the wpca and request the option of having a sewer benefit assessment levied against said vacant land based upon the application of this chapter for the purposes of this type of assessment levy the average mean residential assessment of $72582 shall be used for the determination of the value charge portion of the sewer benefit assessment formula the value charge portion of sewer benefit assessments levied in this manner shall be adjusted at the issuance of a certificate of occupancy and any increased amount due shall be subject to appreciation charges as described below and shall be due and payable at the time of levy  3056 other assessments a the wpca reserves the right to review and reassess properties if improvements thereto result in assessed value greater than 50% the use or classification of the property changes the property converts to yearround use from seasonal use or other reason which in the opinion of the wpca directly results in the increased value of property due to the special benefit of the availability of public sewers reassessments made in response to improvements in

to pay the costs of installing the sanitary sewer facilities which constitute this project after considering the various alternatives for assessment the wpca has concluded that there are four factors which are most significant first there is a general benefit to each property regardless of size or property value  second there is some greater benefit to larger or more valuable buildings  third the size of each property has a distinct bearing on the cost of construction  and fourth there are special costs incidental to a property becoming connected to the sewer system the wpca has analyzed and evaluated those factors b no assessment shall be made against any property in excess of the special benefit to accrue to such property in accord with the general statutes c pursuant to the above the

section d excess discharge added 1202009 1 findings all sewage effluent collected in the town of ellington is discharged for treatment to a facility in another town  and the town of ellington has been granted a limited quantity of flow that it is permitted to discharge to the treatment facilities any excess flow discharged from ellington results in a violation of its contract with the treating town and either jeopardizes ellingtons ability to discharge to that facility at all or results in a surcharge to ellington to cover the excess treatment costs incurred or excessive discharges that may violate the treatment plants permitted rate of discharge under its permit as a result the ellington wpca finds it necessary to discourage excessive discharges from its users and in the event that a user does discharge greater flow than it was permitted may impose the cost of that excess upon the user rather than all of the users and the wpca 2 purpose to address the foregoing issues the wpca does hereby adopt the following regulations 3 definitions as used in the following terms shall have the meanings indicated established flow  that quantity of average daily flow and that quantity of peak daily flow allocated to the user by the wpca at the time the user was permitted to connect to the sewerage system or as the quantity of flow may have been modified from time to time twoyear period  a rolling period of two years beginning on the first day of the billing cycle during which there is a sewage discharge greater than the established flow and ending on the last day of the billing cycle two years later subject to adjustment for any fluctuations in the beginning date of any billing cycle that may extend or shorten the period by a few days 4 first offense in the event a user is or has discharged effluent greater than his or its established flow during a single time or period within any twoyear period then the wpca shall notify the user who shall immediately conduct an investigation to determine the cause of the excess discharge and will take such action as necessary to correct the condition or problem to reduce the discharge to the established flow or less if the discharge is reduced to or below the established  3306 sewer line extensions  3306  flow for the billing period next after the notification there will be no increase in the user rate 5 subsequent offense in the event a user is or has discharged effluent greater than his or its established flow a second time or any additional times within any twoyear period then the wpca may impose a charge on the excess discharge for the full billing period of that second or additional excess discharge equal to three times the standard rate for that user and shall continue that rate until the user reduces its discharge to or below the established rate of discharge 6 in the event that the wpca determines that the continued excess discharge is or will jeopardize its contractual relationship with the treating town andor cause it to be subject to any enforcement action by the connecticut department of environmental protection then it may issue an order to the user to cease any and all discharges to the ellington sewer system and seek enforcement of this order superior court as a violation of the ellington sewer  appeals a any user which feels its user charge is unjust and inequitable may make written application to the wpca requesting a review of the user charge said written request shall where necessary show the actual or estimated average flow andor strength of its wastewater in comparison with values upon which the charge is based including how the measurements or estimates were made b review of the request shall be made by the wpca and if substantiated the user charges for that user shall be recomputed based on the revised flow andor strength data and the new charges shall be applicable to the next billing cycleperiod appendix crystal lake fire district 36editors note
