consequences to residents 441 need for municipal services in unincorporated areas 1 the unincorporated areas to be considered for annexation into the city are located within davis county the expansion area is identified generally as being north and west of the current city boundaries extending westward 2 the need for municipal services in this area would most likely hinge on accommodating development desiring to become a part of the city future needs for community growth will encompass a variety of land uses including low to medium density residential some commercial near the areas of the proposed legacy highway and open space and wetlands history 1109 1209 442 plan for extension of municipal services 1 community growth in the identified annexation area would require the extension of full municipal services these services and infrastructure will be extended into areas on an asneeded basis the plan contains a review of the municipal services and their providers as well as the current status and their ability for extension the plan should be referred to whenever considering the affect of extending services to facilitate an annexation petition 2 currently sewer services in the annexation area are handled tank which limits the potential for significant growth in the area the development of the sewer lift station in the city has made it possible for some land west of the station to connect to the station however a complete evaluation of the capacity and capabilities of the station will be necessary 3 concerns for drainage and flooding will also exist in the designated area for annexation natural and storm drainage channels and canals in the area will require extension ground water issues will need to be evaluated and may necessitate a ban on basement construction methods history 1109 443 how the services will be financed 1 financing of infrastructure expansion will for the most part be paid by the developers of the properties requiring the expansion properties in the unincorporated davis county area will be required to be annexed into the city in order to be connected to the municipal services 2 the city may elect to participate in the financing of some city facilities which will improve service to existing development these costs will be met by various means the city may chose to use general funds impact fees special improvement districts bonding grants or other financial means history 1109 1209 444 an estimate of the tax consequences to residents 1 property taxes from residential properties generally do not cover the full costs of providing services to those residences if all annexation areas are developed solely as residential the annexation of these properties will result in an increase to the citys burden of paying for the services required by the development to decrease the tax burden areas near the proposed legacy highway corridor have been identified for potential commercial uses 2 the plan has an example of comparison of tax rates for property within the city and property in the unincorporated portion of the county in the plan area a similar study for both residential and commercial would need to be accomplished at the time of application review to accurately evaluate the increase upon properties being annexed into the city history 1109 clinton city ordinances title 4 annexation blank page clinton city ordinances

utility poles etc that dominant the view of the driver or pedestrian the streetscape tells residents and visitors how the city as a whole feels about the environment safety aesthetics and its sense of order among other things a useful attractive and safe streetscape is one that necessarily regulates the size location and design of business signs because a proliferation of poorly designed oversized

clinton city central business district design standards and guidelines 123 28191 legislative intent in enacting this chapter of the zoning ordinance special notice has been taken of the fact that the goals of citizens and landowners of clinton often conflict or compete the prior method of zoning regularly forced a winnertakeall solution to the resolution of conflicts between neighbors or adjoining property owners whenever a proposed commercial use encountered objections the city council had only two choices either to permit the use to the detriment of the objectors or to prohibit it entirely to the detriment of the landowner who proposed it whenever a use was permitted usually by virtue of a rezoning the preexisting adjacent users were largely unprotected from any of its negative impacts this chapter has been designed to protect and accommodate both competing interests this has inevitably and properly led to some form of compromise in arriving at these compromises every possible consideration has been given to the public interest individual property rights and externalities while compromise implies mutual concessions or losses it also implies  and this chapter has been designed to provide  mutual gains and benefits it is the goal of this chapter that both the burdens and the benefits which it like any scheme of public regulation implies be rationally and fairly distributed among the citizens and property owners of clinton 28192 establishment of economic development zone this zone is intended to accommodate most of the economic development expected in clinton during the next twentyyear period it consists of the areas where economic development should logically locate as a consequence of planned public facilities and associated capital expenditure this zone provides for development of a generally suburban character it provides for necessary commercial and institutional uses 123 28193 introduction the purpose of the regulations contained in this chapter is to allow maximum utilization of land in the zone while insuring against detrimental impacts on the environment neighboring properties and the public interest this regulatory approach has been termed performance zone because it permits a use to be developed on a particular parcel only if that use on that parcel meets performance standards which have been enacted to insure against the use causing or having the potential to cause the negative impacts mentioned above the format of the regulations in this chapter differs somewhat from that of the rest of the ordinance because performance zoning requires that consideration be given to site parcel characteristics and the range of impacts which any use such as office or retail store may have 1 definitions28 123 high volume traffic

development as outlined in 281914 28198 sight capacity calculation purpose 123 site capacity for any proposed development is equal to the net buildable area of the site multiplied by the floor area factor or impervious surface ratio whichever is more restrictive the site capacity calculation provides the mechanism for subtracting from the base site area all portions of a site inappropriate for

greater intensity may include greater impervious surface coverage with associated increased runoff heat generation reduced percolation and open space increased bulk and height of buildings increased traffic with associated noise and congestion signs and exterior lighting visible from neighboring property late hours of operation and other nuisances thus for example and office use on any lot may meet the standards at intensity class iv v vi vii or viii the range of intensity classes open to a use does not affect whether it can locate on its lot but only how it can develop on that lot performance standards are specified for each intensity class  exceeding any single standard in an intensity class moves a use to the nexthigher intensity class in the event that a use does not appear

planting required thereon both the amount of land and the type and amount of planting specified for each bufferyard requirement of this ordinance are designed to ameliorate nuisances between adjacent land uses or between a land use and a public road the planting units required of bufferyards have been calculated to insure that they do in fact function as buffers 2 bufferyards shall be required to separate different land uses form each other in order to eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as dirt litter noise glare of lights signs and unsightly buildings or parking areas or to provide spacing to reduce adverse impacts of noise odor or danger from fires or explosions clinton city zoning performance standard zone 12 281916 location of bufferyards 163 164 1 to determine the type of bufferyard required between two adjacent parcels or between a parcel and a street the following procedure shall be followed a identify the land use category of the proposed use by referring to table 194 b identify the use category of the land uses adjacent to the proposed use by onsite survey c identify the land use intensity class of all adjoining land uses by referring to table 1914 clinton city will supply this information d classify any street adjacent to the proposed use by referring to the clinton city transportation master plan e determine the bufferyard required on each boundary or segment thereof of the subject parcel by referring to table 1917 2 281918 specifies the bufferyard required between adjacent land uses the requirements are expressed in terms which are further described and detailed in 281918 3 bufferyard specifications are detailed and illustrated in table  the bufferyards illustrated constitute the total bufferyard required between the two adjacent land uses any of the options contained in table  for the required bufferyard shall satisfy the requirement of buffering between adjacent land uses 4 responsibility for bufferyards a when a

provide all additional plant material andor land necessary to provide the total bufferyard required between those two uses by 281918 28 d any development within the performance zone located against an adjacent vacant parcel in a residential zone this first use shall provide the buffer which requires next to a residential use with a class iii land use intensity classification 123 e existing plant material andor land located on the preexisting first developed land use which meets the requirements of this chapter f may be counted as contributing to the total bufferyard required between it and the second adjacent land use to develop 5 streetscape landscaping requirements the requirements mentioned in this section do not in any way supersede those found within of this title with regards to parking lot screening but are to help enhance the streetscape the landscaping along the street can be included in the calculation for landscaping requirements a specifications for bufferyards required against adjoining streets are stipulated in table  b during the site plan review the planning commission will evaluate pedestrian access buffer areas to ease access between the development and the public way as a minimum placement of this access will evaluate slope construction texture snow removal safety and continued access from the area of the buffer to structures c if the planning commission determines that a fence is necessary to be part of a street buffer due to public safety fences will be of a decorative nature selected from the f#w wrought iron type fences or f2b berms if a fence is required the buffer can be deleted in width by 5feet however at no time will the buffer be less than 10feet deep d buffers at corners in order to facilitate the sight triangle where buffers meet at intersection corners the minimum depth of the corner buffer will be equal to the larger buffer for a distance of 40feet from the corner e where a development includes a public rightofway to be developed as a street both sides of the street will be developed with a buffer if there is property adjacent to the rightofway that is not part of the development the buffer on that side of the street will be developed with either a street buffer or a bufferyard standard whichever is the greater f exceptions to the streetscape landscaping requirements shall apply only to the location of the parking area and not that of the building 165 a reduction of the depth requirement on adjacent streets may be reduced from one 1 to but not beyond five 5 feet if it is determined that the evaluation of the

found within this title 28202 prairie style architecture 1 general a the ideas and principles of prairie architecture evolved on the drafting boards of chicago illinois beginning in the 1890s following the lead of frank lloyd wright a group of architects developed over the course of the next 25 years a style of architecture that was unique to america b frank lloyd wright believed that rooms in victorian era homes were boxedin and confining he attempted to refine american housing by designing houses with low horizontal lines and open interior spaces prairie houses were designed to blend in with the flat prairie landscape c many other architects produced prairie homes throughout the american midwest the style was popularized by pattern books and a subtype of the style the american foursquare became one of the most common housing forms in the united states 2 elements of prairie style architecture a elements common to the prairie style of architecture include i simple clean and bold ii horizontal lines massing and patterns iii predominance of hipped roofs with a low roof pitch gabled roofs used for accents entries etc iv large wide overhanging eaves v detailing  ornamentation on windows handrails etc emphasizing horizontal lines vi fenestration  clustering and repetition of windows vii use of geometric shapes viii use of square columns ix long low walls fencing x contrasting color schemes b similar to prairie style architecture is the craftsman style which was a popular style from the early 1900s to 1930 although the prairie style has been selected as the preferred architectural style for the clinton city central business district use of the craftsman style architecture is also deemed acceptable although many elements are the same between the two styles the following are examples of some elements in the craftsman style which vary from the prairie style i exposed rafters ii more use of vertical patterns iii more use of wood and siding iv trellises 3 why was the prairie style chosen for clinton a in april of 199 the city presented with its first commercial development and during the development of the project the planning commission and city council desired to create a cohesive look and aesthetic theme within the central business district of the city at the direction of the council the clinton city zoning central business district design standards 5 planning commission surveyed the existing structures within the city and surrounding area looking for an architectural theme that could be utilized to establish individuality within the district the commission focused its attentions on the existing old church located at 1387 west on 1800 north as a prominent architectural feature within the city b research determined that this structure constructed in 1910 was of a design that predominately exhibited the features of prairie architecture which was prominent in the eastern portion of the us at the time the commission after additional research recommended that the council direct staff to indicate to potential developers the desire for this type of architecture in all future commercial development in the central business district at that time the staff utilized a field guide to american houses by virginia and lee mcalester as a reference in the latter part of 200 the council recognized that the pressure for commercial development within the city mandated a greater emphasis in order to maintain the architectural design desired it was this greater concern that dictated the development of this document 4 goal of using the prairie style architecture goal to achieve a professional and a uniform appearance among all clinton city downtown businesses following the prairie style architecture as shown in the attached exhibits uniformity implies a complimentary look not cookiecutter sameness with variance options and some flexibility within the adopted design standards the desired effect of
