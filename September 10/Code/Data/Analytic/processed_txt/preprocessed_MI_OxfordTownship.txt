the dramatic increase in the number of wireless charter township of oxford 556 zoning effective  communication facilities reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of the change of federal law and policy in and relating to the federal telecommunications act of 199 it is the policy of the township that all users should collocate on attached wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support structures in the interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this section as stated above and as stated in a purpose and intent if a provider fails or refuses to permit
