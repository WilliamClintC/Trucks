enacting this as follows 1 the ability to make reasoned judgments resist peer pressure and understand the consequences of improper behavior increase with age knowledge and experience all of which are likely to increase as a person grows older and these factors justify the application of a curfew to minors but not adults 2 juvenile crime especially nighttime crime has increased over the years and jurisdictions enforcing a nocturnal juvenile curfew have experienced a reduction in crime and noncriminal mischief  3 in recent years minors have increasingly been victims of violent crime and the adoption and enforcement of a curfew ordinance will tend to reverse this trend 4 curfew ordinances tend to reinforce parental authority and supervision  definition of minor for the purposes of this

gatherings or events where alcohol is served to consumed by or in the possession of underage persons  enforcement  purpose intent and findings the city council finds determines and declares that this chapter has been enacted based upon the following facts and purposes 1 the occurrence of parties gatherings or events on private property where alcoholic beverages are served to consumed by or in the possession of underage persons is harmful to the underage persons themselves and is a public nuisance  and 2 according to local state and federal surveys alcohol is overwhelmingly and consistently the most widely used drug at all adolescent age levels and a child who begins alcohol use prior to age 15 is four times as likely to experience alcohol dependence than one who refrains from alcohol use until age 20 or older  and 3 the occurrence of parties gatherings or events on private property where alcoholic beverages are served to consumed by or in the possession of underage persons is harmful to the underage persons themselves and is a public nuisance  and 4 the city of norco has made numerous and substantial efforts to enforce underage drinking and consumption laws despite these efforts use of alcohol by youth remains a serious problem in the city contributing significantly to the incidence of adolescent crime addiction sexual assault truancy driving under the influence of alcohol and motor vehicle crashes involving alcohol and causing injury andor death  and 5 underage persons often obtain alcoholic beverages at gatherings held at private residences or at rented residential or commercial premises that are under the control of a person who knows or should know of the service to possession by andor consumption of alcoholic beverages by underage persons persons responsible for the occurrence of parties gatherings or events on private property over which they have possession or control have failed to ensure that alcoholic beverages are not served to consumed by or possessed by underage persons at these gatherings  and 6 control of parties gatherings or events on private property where alcoholic beverages are served to consumed by or possessed by underage persons is necessary when such activity is determined to be a public nuisance  and 7 persons held responsible for abetting or allowing parties gatherings or events where alcoholic beverages are served to consumed by or possessed by underage persons will be more likely to properly supervise or to stop such conduct at parties gatherings or events held on property in their possession or under their control  and 8 in the past and present law enforcement fire and other emergency response services personnel have responded and are required to respond sometimes on multiple occasions to parties gatherings or events on private property at which alcoholic beverages are served to consumed by or possessed by underage persons and responses to such gatherings result in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources of the city which are underwritten by general municipal taxes paid to the city by its taxpayers and residents and also result in a delay of responses to regular and emergency calls to the rest of the city  and 9 problems associated with parties gatherings or events at which alcoholic beverages are served to consumed by or possessed by underage persons are difficult to prevent or deter unless the city has the legal authority to penalize said action  and 10 the intent of this chapter is to protect the public health safety and enjoyment of residential property and general welfare  and 11 of the state of california business and professions it unlawful for a person under the age of 21 years to purchase or attempt to purchase or consume alcoholic beverages and makes it unlawful for any person to sell any alcoholic beverage to any person under the age of 21 years  and 12 the city council of the city of norco therefore determines that this chapter is a reasonable and necessary means to protect and promote the health safety and general welfare of the youth and other residents of the city of norco   definitions for the purpose of this

adopt the following floodplain management regulations  findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city of norco are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated flood proofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public

areas of special flood hazard  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate

other development to determine if it is proposed within a mudslide area 2 permits shall be reviewed to determine that the proposed site and improvement will be reasonably safe from mudslide hazards factors to be considered in making this determination include but are not limited to a the type and quality of soils b evidence of ground water or surface water problems c depth and quality of any fill d overall slope of the site and e weight that any proposed development will impose on the slope 3 within areas which may have mudslide hazards the floodplain administrator shall require that a a site investigation and further review be made by persons qualified in geology and soils engineering  b the proposed grading excavation new construction and substantial improvement are adequately designed and protected against mudslide damages  c the proposed grading excavations new construction and substantial improvement not aggravate the existing hazard by creating either onsite or offsite

hazard 4 within zone e on the flood insurance rate map a setback is required for all new development from the ocean lake bay riverfront or other body of water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip this buffer shall be designated according to the floodrelated erosion hazard and erosion rate in relation to the anticipated useful life of structures and depending upon the geologic hydrologic topographic and climatic characteristics of the land the buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes such as for agricultural forestry outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only  variance procedure nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  appeal board in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this ordinance and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the city manager in the office of the riverside county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land the city manager will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency  conditions for variances generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to the elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in this chapter to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement or other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance upon

case without prejudice or comparison to similar type or age building which may have greater or lesser earthquake resistance generalities or stereotypes are to be avoided in the evaluation process by focusing on the specifics of the structural system of the building in question and the local geology of the land on which the building is constructed 4 level of investigation some buildings will require extensive testing and field investigation to uncover potential structural deficiencies while others will allow the same level of overall evaluation by a less complicated process due to simplicity of design or the availability of original or subsequent alteration design and construction documents it is the responsibility of the engineer performing the evaluation to choose the appropriate level of investigation which will produce a report that is complete and can serve as a sound basis for a conclusion on the collapse hazard the building may present 5 format for the report the following is a basic outline of the format each engineering report should follow this outline is not to be construed to be a constraint on the professional preparing the report but rather to provide a skeleton framework within which individual approaches to assembling the information required by the ordinance may be accomplished it also will serve as a means for the city to evaluate the completeness of each report a general information a description of the building including i the street address  ii the type of occupancy use within the building with separate uses that generate different occupant loads indicated on a plan showing the square footage of each different use  iii plans and elevations showing the location type and extent of lateral force resisting elements in the

preparing the report such a request shall provide evidence that adequate information concerning the required items can be determined by alternate means or that conclusions can be made about the item without following the solution called for in the appropriate appendix the purpose of granting such exceptions shall be to reduce the costs or disruption that would result from taking required actions when it can be shown that they are unnecessary to provide information available by other equivalent means in no case will an exception be granted which would result in an item not being completely evaluated the decision of the chief building official in granting exceptions is final  review of reports 1 the city shall utilize the services of civil or structural engineers to assist the building

collocation or modification increases the width more than 20 feet from the edge of the wireless tower or the width of the wireless tower at the level of the appurtenance whichever is greater  3 the proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved not to exceed four  or 4 the proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the wireless tower including any access or utility easements currently related to the site b for towers in the public rightsofway and for all base stations a substantial change occurs when 1 the proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than 10 percent or 10 feet whichever is greater  2 the proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than six feet from the edge of the wireless tower or base station  3 the proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground when there are no existing groundmounted equipment cabinets  4 the proposed collocation or modification involves the installation
