township the recording of local law is an aspect of municipal history and as the community develops and changes review and revision of old laws and consideration of new laws in the light of current trends must keep pace the orderly collection of these records is an important step in this evercontinuing process legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records it must be available and logically arranged for convenient use and must be kept uptodate it was with thoughts such as these in mind that the township council ordered the following

effectively enforced taught in the homes internalized and adhered to for generations all for the good of minors for the furtherance of family responsibility and for the public good safety and welfare b the township council finds that the curfew meets a very real local need and has been over the years a significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency and should be updated and amplified in the light of bristols local situation and facts the curfew hours declared by this article take into consideration the danger hours for nocturnal crime and for accumulations of minors with potential risks incident to immaturity  06  15  2005  872 bristol code  873 c bristol is a stable family community parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the norm  legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a demonstrated effectiveness over the years  as parental control increases the likelihood of juvenile delinquency decreases  and there is a continuing need for the nocturnal curfew for minors which has achieved and will continue to achieve under local conditions the purposes hereinbefore stated  873 definitions and word usage a for the purposes of this article the following terms phrases words and their derivations shall have the meanings given herein minor  any person under the age of 18 or in equivalent phrasing often herein employed any person 17 or fewer years of age parent  any person having legal custody of a minor 1 as a natural or adoptive parent  2 as a legal guardian  3 as a person who stands in loco parentis  or 4 as a person to whom legal

persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home to implement that thought with additional precision and precaution numerous exceptions are expressly defined in  875 more and more exceptions become available with increasing years as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation which is intended by use of the meaningful phrase be or remain found constitutional in baker v borough of steelton 17 dauph 171912 street  a way or place of whatever nature open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case of a sidewalk thereof for pedestrian travel the term street includes the legal rightofway including but not limited to the cartway of traffic lanes the curb the

administrative offices and police station township  the township of bristol bucks county pennsylvania year of age  continues from one birthday such as the 17th to but not including the day of the next such as the 18th birthday making it clear that 17 or fewer years of age is hereby treated as equivalent to the phrase under 18 years of age the latter phrase in practice unfortunately having confused a number of persons into the mistaken thought that eighteenyearolds might be involved similarly for example 11 or fewer years of age means under 12 years of age b when not inconsistent with the context words used in the present tense include the future words in the plural number include the singular and words in the singular number include the plural the word shall is always mandatory and not merely directory  874 curfew for minors established it shall be unlawful for any person 17 or fewer years of age under 18 to be or remain in or upon the streets within the township of bristol at

by a parent of such minor to take said parents place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified area 3 when exercising first amendment rights protected by the united states constitution such as the free exercise of religion freedom of speech and the right of assembly such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by first delivering to the managing director a written communication signed by such minor and countersigned if practicable by a parent of such minor with their home address and telephone number specifying when where and in what manner said minor will be on the streets at night during hours when this article is otherwise  06  15  2005  875 bristol code  875 applicable to said minor in the exercise of a first amendment right specified in such communication 4 in case of reasonable necessity but only after such minors parent has communicated to the township police station personnel the facts establishing such reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a designated time for a described purpose including points of origin and destination a copy of such communication or of the police record thereof duly certified by the chief of police to be correct with an appropriate notation of the time it was received and of the names and address of such parent and minor shall be admissible evidence 5 when the

termination has been given in writing to and duly filed for immediate reference by the chief of police or the officer assigned by him on duty at the police station thus encouraging here as in other exceptional situations conduct on the part of minors involved in such activities and striking a fair balance for any somewhat conflicting interests 7 when authorized by special permit from the managing director carried on the person of the minor thus authorized as follows when necessary nighttime activities of a minor may be inadequately provided for by other provisions of this article then recourse may be had to the managing director either for a regulation as provided in 8 or for a special permit as the circumstances warrant upon the managing directors finding of necessity for the use of the streets to the extent warranted by a written application as judicially approved in people v walton 161 p 2d 498 502  503 cal app 1945 signed by a minor and by a parent of such minor if feasible stating the name age and address of such minor  the name address and telephone number of a parent thereof  the height weight sex color of eyes and hair and other physical characteristics of such minor  the necessity which requires such minor to remain upon the streets during the curfew hours otherwise applicable  and the street or route and the beginning and ending of the period of time involved by date and hour the managing director may grant a permit in writing for the use by such minor of such streets at such hours as in the managing directors opinion may reasonably be necessary in an emergency this may be handled by telephone or other effective communication with a corresponding record being made contemporaneously either to the managing director or if unavailable to the police officer authorized by the managing director to act on his behalf in an emergency at the police station 8 when authorized by regulation issued by the managing director in other similar cases of reasonable necessity similarly handled but adapted to necessary nighttime activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on an individual special  06  15  2005  875 curfew  876 permit basis normally such regulation by the managing director permitting use of the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity media and agencies such as the schools and shall define the activity the scope of the use of the streets permitted the period of time involved not to extend more than 30 minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity and the reason for finding that such regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the purposes of this article 9 when the minor carries a certified card of employment renewable each calendar month when the current facts so warrant dated or reissued not more than 45 days previously signed by the chief of police and briefly identifying the minor the addresses of his home and of his place of employment and his hours of employment 10 when the minor is with parental consent in a motor vehicle this contemplates normal travel from excess of caution this clearly exempts bona fide interstate movement this also exempts interstate travel beginning or ending in bristol 11 when the minor is 17 years of age if and when the managing director shall have determined by formal rule first reported to the township council spread upon its minutes and so reported in the press finding the facts as to the extent minimal of juvenile delinquency in such age group permitting such rule currently in the best interest of said minors and of the township then the managing director by such formal rule covering a period of time designated therein or until rescission thereof not exceeding one year from the date thereof may take appropriate action excepting designated minors minors in a defined group or area or all minors as the current facts may warrant 17 years of age at the date or attaining 17 years of age during the period that such formal rule is and remains in effect b each of the foregoing exceptions and their several limitations such as provisions for notification is severable as hereinafter provided but here reemphasized  and additional also severable exceptions broadening with the progress toward maturity of minors enrolled respectively in elementary junior high and high schools will be considered by the

subdivision and land development  see ch 177 zoning  see ch 205 article i general provisions  1731 statement of findings the governing body of bristol township finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of  1732 stormwater management  1732  05222020 public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e through project design impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized to maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality groundwater recharge stream base flow and aquatic ecosystems the most cost effective and environmentally advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is project design minimizing impervious surfaces and sprawl avoiding sensitive areas ie stream buffers floodplains steep slopes and considering topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime f public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater g federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes h nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the municipality  1732 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote health safety and welfare within the delaware river south watershed by minimizing the damages described in  1731a designed to a promote alternative project designs and layout that minimize impacts to surface and groundwater b promote nonstructural best management practices bmps  1732 bristol code  1732 05222020  c minimize increases in stormwater volume d minimize impervious surfaces e manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at their source by regulating activities that cause these problems f utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems as much as possible g encourage recharge of groundwater where appropriate and prevent degradation of groundwater quality h manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source requiring a minimum of structures and relying on natural processes i focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources j maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the municipality and the commonwealth k meet legal water quality requirements under state law including regulations at 25 pa 4a requiring protection and maintenance of existing uses and maintenance of the level of water quality to support those uses in all streams and the protection and maintenance of water quality in special protection streams l address the quality and quantity of stormwater discharges from the development site m provide a mechanism to identify stormwater controls necessary to meet npdes permit requirements n implement an illegal discharge detection and elimination program that addresses nonstormwater discharges into the municipalitys separate storm sewer system o preserve and restore the floodcarrying capacity of streams p prevent scour and erosion of

neshaminy creek watershed stormwater management aka neshaminylittle neshaminy stormwater management   1742 stormwater management  1743  05222020  1742 statement of findings the governing body of the municipality finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development and redevelopment throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens c a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater is an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater f federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes  1743 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health safety and welfare within the neshaminy creek watershed by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime and by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in  1742 designed to a meet legal water quality requirements under state law including regulations at 25 pa to protect maintain reclaim and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this commonwealth b minimize increases in stormwater volume and control peak flows c minimize impervious surfaces  1744 bristol code  1745 05222020  d provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and management e preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible f manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source requiring a minimum of structures and relying on natural processes g focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources h preserve and restore the floodcarrying capacity of streams i prevent scour and erosion of streambanks and streambeds j provide standards to meet national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permit

university of pennsylvania paul w meyer curator dr ann f rhoads plant pathologist paul sell urban forestry intern september 1980 introduction in response to state legislation regulating runoff from sites undergoing construction many developers have constructed stormwater detention basins these basins ranging in size from a few thousand square feet to several acres are now a common sight in new housing developments where they constitute a continuing maintenance problem because of the extensive grading required to create a basin the fmished site usually consists of exposed subsoil in a disturbed condition berms surrounding the basins are subject to erosion cement aprons at inlet and outlet pipes are an attempt to reduce washouts at these points as is the use of special paving surfaces at emergency spillways in lower makefield township most completed detention basins have been seeded with grass and are mowed every few weeks during the growing season a fairly expensive solution to the maintenance problem because of the soil conditions grass establishment has been uneven allowing for continued erosion problems several basins have natural wet areas which cannot be mowed one is actually a retention basin with a permanent pond surrounded by a secondary basin in all areas periodic flooding is a factor which must be considered although inundation for more than a few hours is unusual we have approached the problem of developing a landscape design for a typical detention basin with the following goals in mind 1 the mature landscape should not have a negative effect on the hydrological function of the basin 2 the landscaped basins should be aesthetically pleasing and compatible with the surrounding land use 3 the landscaped basins should require a minimum of maintenance once the original plantings have become established the basic concept on which we have based our plan involves the creation of a mixed meadow of native or naturalized grass species and compatible wild flowers after an initial period of establishment a single annual mowing should be adequate to maintain the meadow where basins adjoin existing woodland or hedgerows we have suggested planting appropriate trees and shrubs in a naturalistic manner to blend in 177 attachment  06152005 bristol code with the surroundings we also suggest the use of selected trees and shrubs at sites within the basins for visual interest shade wildlife habitat and screening difficult areas such as steep slopes and stream and pond edges have also been addressed this report includes lists of plants for each situation including nursery sources basin floors in the detention basin floors an established meadow of native and naturalized wildflowers and grasses would provide a pleasing lowmaintenance landscape two types of meadow situations exist basin floors which are usually welldrained but subject to occasional flooding and permanently wet areas each area requires somewhat different plant species but there is considerable overlap a typical meadow mix includes wildflowers and prairie or meadow grasses clumpforming as opposed to matforming grasses should be used to allow space for the wildflowers to fill in and because they are more ornamental suggested wildflowers and grasses and their sources are listed in the appendix to save on seeding time and labor costs and for areas too wet to work with equipment we recommend hydroseeding the application of a slurry of seed and water to the soil the slurry may also contain fertilizer and wood fiber  then the technique is called hydromulching the wood fiber helps to hold the seed in place until germination occurs because of the extensive grading involved in creating a detention basin the floor usually consists of subsoil and a soil test by a reputable laboratory should be taken to determine the nutrient requirements the recommended amount of fertilizer which can be added to the seedwater slurry should be a conventional fast release form so it is available to the germinated seedlings the preferable times for meadow seeding are april 1 to may 1 and september 1 to october 1 a table of wildflower and grass seeding rates is included in the appendix meadow grasses and wildflowers require two years for good establishment to discourage annual weeds during the initial period a quick shortlived relatively noncompetitive nurse crop such as wild canadian rye elvmus canadensis is recommended during the first two years three mowings per year at a height of eight inches may be necessary to discourage weedy invaders while allowing the meadow plants to establish themselves after establishment one annual mowing in either late fall or early spring should be sufficient to maintain the meadow wet edges in areas that remain wet all or most of the time a mixture of woody and herbaceous swamp species is appropriate pond banks and stream edges can be stabilized by such herbaceous plants as cattails reed canary grass bulrushes swamp rose mallow purple loosestrife or swamp smartweed or woody species such as bald cypress blackgum sweetgum shadbush river birch red osier dogwood and winterberry holly playing fields relatively level areas in or around the detention basin might be utilized as playing fields by the neighboring children because of the nature of the basin it would not be appropriate for highly organized sports but it would be suitable for activities like touch football frisbee games and kite flying 177 attachment  06 15  2005 subdivision and land development in existing basins these should be located on the higher end of the basin away from the drainage pipe new basins could be designed so the playing field is at a slightly higher elevation than the lowest point of the basin through proper engineering the playing field could be well drained most of the time being flooded only briefly by heavier rainstorms in most cases the field would again be usable three or four days after being flooded the playing field surface should be evenly graded and covered with at least three inches of topsoil stockpiled from the site before construction soil tests should be taken and the required amendments added to ensure quick establishment of the turf thereby preventing erosion the seeding mix should consist of a mixture of 25 pounds of kentucky fescue 31 plus five pounds of perennial ryegrass per acre straw mulch or hydromulching is critical in preventing erosion and protecting the young grass seedlings once established the playing field will require mowing at twoandonehalfinch height every two weeks in the spring and every three weeks thereafter because of the mowing required playing fields should only be installed in neighborhoods where such a facility is needed and where use justifies the periodic mowing wooded areas where detention basins adjoin wooded areas we suggest the planting of trees and shrubs selected to blend in with the surroundings these plantings might be used to extend a woodland edge down the bank of a basin or to continue an existing hedgerow part way around the basin in such areas plantings should be of sufficient density to eliminate the need for mowing in addition scattered clusters of trees and shrubs might be located within the basin for aesthetic interest to create shaded areas to provide wildlife habitat and for wind control or visual screening plants to be located within the basins should be selected from the list of trees and shrubs tolerant of wet soils  those for planting on rims or banks should be species tolerant of dry soil conditions see appendix deciduous trees and shrubs should be planted during the spring late march to midmay or fall early october until the ground freezes tulip poplar magnolias and sweetgum are exceptions which should only be planted in the spring evergreens are best moved in late summer or early fall midaugust to late september the township should encourage the contractor to wait for the proper season for planting but it may be advisable to require a performance bond to cover the work for this type of planting we recommend trees of one to oneandonehalfinch caliper and shrubs in the two to threefoot size range balled and burlapped nursery stock is generally preferred however with careful handling bare root plants may be very satisfactory and considerably less expensive bare root nursery stock must be planted in the early spring while the trees are still dormant or late in the season after winter dormancy has set in a detail drawing is attached see appendix showing planting procedures for balled and burlapped stock placement of the top of the root ball three to four inches above the original soil line is important to the successful establishment of trees in wet areas heavy mulching will prevent excessive drying between rains slopes slopes require special attention due to the problem of erosion where slopes are gentle a mixture of meadow grasses and wildflowers as recommended for basin floors is suggested wherever possible slopes should be limited to 15 percent grade this not only decreases the erosion potential but also allows for periodic mowing 177 attachment  06  15  2005 bristol code where slopes are steeper we suggest the use of herbaceous groundcovers such as crown vetch coronilla varia birdsfoot trefoil lotus corniculatus or tiger lilies hemorocallis fulva if crown vetch or birdsfoot trefoil are seeded a nurse crop such as perennial rye will be necessary to provide cover while the permanent plants become established dense spreading shrubs are also suitable cover on steep slopes or where you wish to limit access for instance around inlet and outlet pipes species for this purpose are identified by an asterisk on the list of shrubs tolerant of dry soils included in the appendix a heavy mulch should be used during the period of establishment of shrub plantings screen plantings with a landscape management plan for the entire detention basin area complete perimeter screening of the site may not be necessary or desirable presently entire sites are often screened with a line of white pines around the basins though this is an effective buffer rows of white pine do not complement the existing landscape nor do they make the most of attractive open spaces which often adjoin the detention basin furthermore the use of only one species could lead to serious problems if a new insect or disease should become prevalent early in the design phase the site should be reviewed to determine both the assets and liabilities of the property unsightly views to be hidden as well as good views to be preserved should be identified screen plantings should consist of clusters of evergreens interspersed with groupings of deciduous trees and shrubs deciduous plants should be chosen to add flowers and ornamental diversity to the landscape as well as provide food and shelter for wildlife native plants or plants with a naturalistic appearance should be used whenever possible evergreens in a single cluster should all be the same species but on any given site several evergreen species should be used to ensure that the entire stand is not eliminated by a single insect or disease problem size of the clusters could vary from three to fifteen plants depending on the scale of the project these should usually be planted in staggered curvilinear fashion to match the form of the land large evergreen trees like white pine should not be planted closer than fifteen feet on center if a high percentage of immediate opacity is required increase the depth of the planting refer to the appendix for lists of evergreen and deciduous plants suitable for screening 177 attachment  06 15
