particular services in order to determine fees owed to the city the following proportional methodology shall be applied the combined bundled revenues derived from a subscriber shall be allocated to each of the bundled tied or combined services in the proportions that the standard published rate for each of the services as realistically offered by grantee or an affiliated entity to and paid by subscribers who receive only the individual service bears to the sum of such rates for all of the bundled tied or combined services  except that a grantee may use an alternative methodology if the results of such alternative allocation are reasonably equivalent to the results which would be derived from the proportional methodology specified in this provision grantee shall bear any burden of proof regarding whether the actual methodology used is reasonably equivalent to the proportional methodology for purposes of this paragraph reasonably equivalent shall mean the revenue associated with any particular service resulting from the alternative allocation is within five percent 5% of the amount resulting from the proportional methodology if a particular service is not realistically offered on a stand alone basis and thus it may be impracticable to apply the methodology for a particular service the standard published rate of a competitor offering a comparable stand alone service may be used in the allocation subject to the approval of the city furthermore for purposes of this paragraph realistically offered shall mean at least five percent 5% of subscribers for a particular service receive only that service and pay the standard published rate for that service if a grantee offers bundled cable services and noncable services to subscribers a grantee shall fairly and

determine if the tax is being levied and collected in accordance with this chapter e to prevent evasion of franchise fees city tax or in lieu fees revenues of affiliates derived from the operation of the cable communications system to provide cable communications service will be treated as the revenue of the operator  but nothing herein shall be read to permit the city to charge a fee on affiliate revenues where the revenues were also included in the calculation of the revenues of a grantee f persons who provide cable services or other cable communications services to subscribers for a fee via a cable communications system and whose revenues are not included in the franchise fees specified above may be charged a fee by the city equal to five percent 5% of the gross revenues of such person derived from the provision of such other service over the cable communications system unless prohibited by state or federal law g the fact that a fee is paid based on revenues derived from one type of service provided over a cable communications system does not excuse an operator from its duty to pay fees and taxes imposed by the city on other types of services provided over that facility as an example and not as a limitation of the foregoing a cable communications operator who pays a franchise fee on revenues derived from the provision of cable communications services must pay the fees imposed upon noncable service providers to the extent that it provides such services and consistent with applicable law h general rules for payment of fees 1 unless otherwise specified in a franchise

municipal other applicable law 5 in the event any payment is not received within thirty 30 days from the end of the calendar quarter grantee shall pay in addition to the payment or sum due interest

unless otherwise provided by this chapter or some other provision of the zoning on   site requirements for residential zones a purpose the purpose of this section is to establish basic site requirements for residential zones in redmond these requirements implement redmonds comprehensive plan the growth management act the multicounty planning policies and the countywide planning policies while also protecting redmonds residential areas from public nuisances incompatible uses and other hazards b site requirements in zone use charts each zone use chart in rzc  forth the basic dimensional standards for residential development in that zoning district rzc  additional general requirements applicable to all zoning districts some site requirements may be modified as provided in rzc  c allowed density 1 purpose the purpose of the allowed density requirement is to a help maintain a consistent and compatible land use pattern in redmonds residential neighborhoods  b serve redmonds planned housing needs  and city of redmond  redmond zoning rmc title 21  c prevent public nuisances that result from a lack of adequate open space and the over utilization of public facilities 2 requirements the allowed density as shown in each residential zone use chart in rzc  represents the maximum number of dwelling units that may occupy an acre of land exclusive of bonuses and exclusive of accessory dwelling units 3 calculations when calculating allowed density for any given site in the city the gross area of the site is multiplied by the allowed density per acre that applies to the zone where the site is located the result is the maximum number of units other than adus that may occupy that site please note that any available density bonuses are calculated on the base density calculating maximum number of dwelling units example r4 zone allowed density of 4 units per acre gross site area 21780 square feet x 443560   2 maximum allowed dwelling units 4 north redmond residential development and conservation overlay density transfer and limitations the residential development and conservation overlay zone is applied to those properties within the north redmond neighborhood and adjacent preannexation areas as shown on the zoning map this designation establishes a maximum for the underlying zoning at r4 in those areas determined to be developable in the critical areas report submitted at the time of application for development additionally for those areas determined to be critical areas and the associated buffers densities may be transferred to developable areas at a maximum of one unit per acre see figure a below a rezone for higher densities beyond the established r 4 four units per acre may not occur in addition to the allowed density bonus incentives are applicable as designated in the north redmond neighborhood plan or elsewhere in the redmond zoning of redmond  redmond zoning rmc title 21  figure a north redmond residential development and conservation overlay density transfer d minimum required density 1 purpose the purpose of minimum required density is to a help establish a consistent and compatible land use pattern in redmond residential neighborhoods  b provide for the efficient use of land  c provide for the efficient use of public facilities and services  and d reduce public nuisances that often result when undeveloped areas are urbanized 2 relationship to allowed density while allowed density places an upper limit on the number of units that may be located on a site the minimum required density establishes a lower limit when taken together the site calculations for allowed density and minimum required density create an upper and lower range that defines the number of units that may be built on a site exclusive of accessory dwelling units one important difference between allowed density and minimum required density is that allowed city of redmond  redmond zoning rmc title 21  density is calculated using gross site area while minimum required density uses the net buildable area of a site 3 requirements the minimum required number of dwelling units for a site is equal to the sites net buildable area multiplied by the sites allowed or zoned density and multiplied again by the minimum required density percentage the net buildable area calculation is explained below in subsection d4 of this section the minimum required density percentage as well as the allowed density for each residential zone is shown in the zone use charts in rzc   net buildable area calculation net buildable area for the purpose of determining the minimum required number of dwelling units for a site shall be calculated by subtracting areas where building is prohibited or subject to significant restrictions from the gross area of a site the area remaining after these exclusions from the gross site area represents the net buildable area the following exclusions from the gross site area and only these exclusions may be used in determining net buildable area a critical areas and shoreline areas where development is prohibited or restricted shall be excluded from the net buildable area these critical areas and shoreline areas shall include landslide hazard areas  category i wetlands  class i streams  floodways  floodplains  critical areas buffers  the area waterward of the line of the ordinary high water mark on lake sammamish regardless of the extent of ownership  lands required to be maintained in open space  and native growth protection areas b surface water retention areas that are dedicated or otherwise held in common shall also be excluded from the net buildable area c public rightsofway private streets and access corridors parks and open space that are dedicated or otherwise held in common and aboveground public facilities shall also be excluded from the net buildable area d for example where gross site area equals 87120 square feet or two acres the following calculation is made to determine net buildable area calculating net buildable area example gross site area 87120 square feet  critical areas and buffers 6100 square feet  public rightsofway 15680 square feet   net buildable area 65340 square feet 15 acres e in order to avoid the expense of technically assessing a sites net buildable area a builderdeveloper may elect to apply the minimum required density percentage to the gross area of the site instead of the net buildable area in order to determine the minimum required number of units 5 minimum required density calculation the formula for determining a sites minimum required number of dwelling units is shown below city of redmond  redmond zoning rmc title 21  calculating minimum required density net buildable area x allowed density x minimum required density percentage   minimum required number of units example gross site area   87120 square feet 2 acres net buildable area   65340 square feet 15 acres allowed density   6

minimum tract area in order to develop a site this is simply the land area that is part of the development application existing rightsofway are excluded from the calculation b lot frontage some zones require a minimum lot frontage in order to develop a site calculate this by measuring the length of the lot abutting a public or private street or access corridor see figure a for an example city of redmond  redmond zoning rmc title 21  figure a minimum lot frontage c setbacks 1 all zones require minimum or maximum setbacks setbacks shall be measured a from the property line b at right angles or as near to right angles as possible c in a plane horizontal to the ground city of redmond  redmond zoning rmc title 21  2 the front of the lot is the side nearest the street or access corridor that provides the primary access the rear is opposite the front or as nearly so as the lot shape permits the sides are 90 degrees to the front or as nearly so as the lot shape permits figure b building setbacks d impervious surface area all zones have impervious surface area limits calculate impervious surface area by summing the area of all impervious surfaces on the site developments can meet impervious surface area requirements on a lotbylot basis or on a developmentwide basis e height 1 all zones set limits on building height to calculate the height of a structure a draw the smallest rectangle possible around it b find the midpoint of each side of the rectangle c calculate the finished grade at that point d average the elevations for the four midpoints e subtract the result from the buildings highest elevation 2 hose towers when associated with a fire station chimneys antennae smoke and ventilation stacks flagpoles heating cooling and ventilation equipment mechanical

of all structures on the site excluding parking structures c divide the gross floor area by the gross site area d use the same units eg feet or acres for both site and structure area 2 for properties under a common ownership that are contiguous or separated only by rightsofway far may be calculated based on the average far across those properties and density and impervious surface coverage may be transferred among contiguous properties provided the properties meet other applicable regulations g landscaped area many zones require minimum landscape areas calculate a sites landscape area by subtracting area devoted to building parking storage or accessory uses and stormwater detention ponds from the total site area a landscape area may include patios plazas walkways walls and fences water features such as fountains or pools and planting areas stormwater detention ponds may count toward the landscape area total if they are integrated with landscaping h lot coverage many zones have

administrator to determine compliance with the citys transportation concurrency policies and regulations 2 certificate of concurrency a proposed development passes the transportation concurrency test if the mobility unit mu demand from the proposed development is less than or equal to the unallocated mu supply from tfp the administrator shall issue a certificate of concurrency to a proposed development that passes the concurrency test a valid certificate of concurrency is necessary for development approval a certificate of concurrency shall include an adequate description of the development proposal to which the certificate applies and any further information necessary to administer this division the certificate may not be transferred to another proposed development unless approved by the administrator city of redmond  redmond zoning rmc title 21  a certificate of concurrency shall be valid for 180 days the certificate of concurrency will remain valid if a complete development application is received by the city within 180 days of the certificate being issued and subsequently for the duration that development application is under review by the city a certificate of concurrency will continue to be valid for the same period of time as the development approval granted by the city if the development approval does not have an expiration date the certificate of concurrency shall be valid for one year and then up to two oneyear extensions upon approval by the administrator 3 certificate of concurrency denial a certificate of concurrency will be denied if the unallocated mu supply is less than the mu demand from the proposed development 4 administrators decision and appeal process decisions made by the administrator pursuant to this division may be appealed as specified in rmc 310 impact fees 5 expiration a certificate of concurrency shall expire a if a complete application for the development for which concurrency is reserved is not made within 180 days of issuance of the concurrency certificate if a certificate of concurrency expires before a complete development application is submitted to the city the developer must wait 30 days before submitting another concurrency application request for the same development  or b if either the related development application expires or is denied or if the related development approval expires or is revoked by the city g available options when the mobility unit mu supply is insufficient to serve a proposed development 1 if a development is tested for transportation concurrency and does not pass the developer may a reduce the size of the proposed development until the mu demand is equal to or less than the mu supply that is available  b delay the proposed development until the city or others increase the mu supply  c obtain supplemental mitigation by purchasing sufficient mus to serve the mu demand of the proposed development  d upon approval by the administrator a developer may implement tdm strategies as supplemental mitigation provided that the mu demand from a proposed development is reduced due to the elimination of trips and the tdm strategies become a legal project approval condition of the development the administrator will determine consistent with accepted engineering and planning practice the appropriate reduction in trips and mode split to be applied to the proposed development and shall review and approve the tdm strategies proposed by the developer provided that i these strategies shall be prenegotiated and approved by the administrator  city of redmond  redmond zoning rmc title 21  ii there shall be methods to monitor and enforce tdm performance and a fallback plan which would be implemented if the development fails to achieve tdm goals within two years  iii the tdm strategies become a condition tied to all future owners of the development and property  and iv the tdm strategies meet the criteria of subsection g3 below 2 payment for and timing of supplemental mitigation if allowed by the administrator a developer may provide funding in an amount equal to the citys estimated cost of the necessary mus the cost per mu supplied shall be indexed for inflation using the same method used to update transportation impact fees the administrator with the concurrence of other affected city departments may provide for latecomer agreements as provided by state law or for other reimbursement from properties benefited by the improvements unless the city council finds reimbursement to be inappropriate the administrator may require that a developer build or implement a transportation improvement rather than provide funding funds for transportation improvements must be paid by the developer to the city prior to issuance of a building permit final plat approval or other approval requiring improvements under this section  provided that the developer may at the administrators option submit an assurance device in a form approved by the administrator a developer providing supplemental mitigation may receive credit towards payment of required transportation impact fees credit determination shall be made according to rmc 310 impact fees 3 supplemental mitigation decision criteria  acceptable supplemental mitigation requires a finding by the administrator that a the supplemental mitigation meets the definition outlined in rzc definitions  or if a developer proposes as supplemental mitigation a transportation improvement that is not identified in the citys transportation facilities plan tfp the transportation improvement must first be considered and approved as an amendment to the comprehensive plan before the supplemental mitigation is approved b the mu supply is available concurrent with the development or that a financial commitment is in place to complete the improvement that provides the mu supply within six years c the effect of the improvement would not result in a reduction or the loss of another transportation objective including but not limited to maintaining high occupancy vehicle lanes sidewalks paths trails or bicycle lanes d any adverse environmental impacts of the proposed transportation improvement can be reasonably mitigated city of redmond  redmond zoning rmc title 21  e the improvement is consistent with accepted engineering and planning standards and practices f where practical transportation improvements required as part of supplemental mitigation should be made at locations most impacted by the development g a developer proposing tdm strategies demonstrates that the mu demand is reduced the developer must have additional strategies to address a situation where the reduction in mu demand is not met by the developers initial tdm strategies h notwithstanding the foregoing the administrator has the authority to require correction of a documented safetyrelated deficiency 4 supplemental mitigation denial process if the administrator determines that the proposed supplemental mitigation does not meet the requirements of this section the administrator may deny the issuance of a certificate of concurrency the redmond comprehensive plan transportation element describes these demands as follows to achieve redmonds transportation vision the policies have been developed with a common understanding of the concepts of mobility circulation and access mobility is the ability to travel over distances  circulation is the ability to move about within an area connecting different localized land uses  and access is the ability to get to individual destinations 2 redmond comprehensive plan transportation element p 93  effective on   transportation management program a applicability 1 all development applications that warrant transportation mitigation are required to comply with this division a transportation management program tmp is required a when a nonresidential development generates demand for more than 25 mobility units provided that under this requirement in mixed use developments a tmp is required only for the nonresidential portion of the development  b in order for a development to achieve concurrency as

purposes of this chapter are to 1 preserve the citys important environmental features while allowing development to occur if compatible with and in consideration of these critical areas  2 assure the conservation and protection of critical areas from loss or degradation by classifying and designating the same and to restrict land uses and development which are incompatible with environmentally critical areas  3 achieve no net loss of core preservation areas within fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas which includes riparian corridors and minimize impact to and retain character of quality habitat areas and protect species of concern priority species and species of local importance  4 avoid wetland impacts and achieve a goal of no net loss of wetland function value and acreage  and where possible enhance and restore wetlands  5 achieve no net loss of structure value and functions of natural systems within frequently flooded areas and to employ no net impact floodplain management in order to avoid impacts to upstream and downstream properties and substantial risk and damage to public and private property and loss of life  6 protect critical aquifer recharge areas by avoiding land use activities that pose potential contamination and minimize impacts to recharge areas application of strict performance standards  city of redmond  redmond zoning rmc title 21  7 avoid and minimize potential impacts to life and property from geologic hazards such that sites are rendered as safe as one not containing such hazard levels of study and analysis application of sound

flooding  b protect unique fragile and valuable elements of the environment including ground and surface waters wetlands and fish and wildlife and their habitats  c direct activities not dependent on critical area resources to less ecologically sensitive sites and mitigate unavoidable impacts to critical areas by regulating alterations in and adjacent to critical areas  and d prevent cumulative adverse environmental impacts to water quality wetlands and fish and wildlife habitat and the overall net loss of wetlands frequently flooded areas and habitat conservation areas  10 provide standards guidelines and criteria to guide application of these critical areas goals and policies when considered with other goals and policies of the rzc including those pertaining to natural features and environmental protection  11 serve as a basis for exercise of the citys substantive authority under the state environmental policy act sepa and the citys sepa rules  12 protect critical areas in accordance with the growth management act and application of best available science as determined according to wac 365195900 in consultation with state and federal agencies and other qualified professionals  and 13 coordinate environmental review and permitting of proposals to avoid duplication and delay b findings the city finds that 1 redmond contains certain areas that can be identified and characterized as environmentally sensitive or critical such areas within the city include fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas wetlands frequently flooded areas geologically hazardous areas and critical aquifer recharge areas and their associated buffers 2 past growth patterns have in some cases contributed in natural disasters which threaten public health and safety and that by preventing development on certain critical areas the city can better maintain public health safety and welfare in addition by preserving features that provide for clean water fisheries and wildlife the city can city of redmond  redmond zoning rmc title 21  help maintain a positive ecological balance that provides for the immediate and longterm public welfare 3 critical areas perform a variety of valuable and beneficial biological and physical functions that benefit the city and its residents some types of critical areas may also pose a threat to human safety or to public and private property the functions of critical areas include the following a fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas wildlife areas are ecosystems composed of unique interacting systems of soils geology topography and plant and animal communities they consist of landbased areas and aquatic areas wildlife habitat provides opportunities for food cover nesting breeding and movement for fish and wildlife within the city  maintains and promotes diversity of species and habitat within the city  helps to maintain air and water quality  controls erosion  serves as areas for recreation education and scientific study and aesthetic appreciation  and provides neighborhood separation and visual diversity within urban areas riparian corridors are essential for wild fish populations healthy riparian zones are dynamic ecosystems that perform various functions that form salmonid habitat some of the major functions include producing and delivering large and small woody debris to shorelines and stream channels  shoreline protection and habitat formation  removing sediments and dissolved chemicals from water  moderating water temperature  providing favorable microclimate  providing habitat for terrestrial animals  and providing proper nutrient sources for aquatic life additionally aquatic areas and their associated buffers store and convey stormwater and floodwater  recharge groundwater  and serve as areas for recreation education and scientific study and aesthetic appreciation the citys overall goal shall be no net loss of riparian corridor functions and values b wetlands wetlands are fragile ecosystems which serve a number of important beneficial functions wetlands assist in the reduction of erosion siltation flooding ground and surface water pollution and provide wildlife plant and fisheries habitats wetlands destruction and impairment may result in increased public and private costs or property losses wetland buffers serve to moderate runoff volume and flow rates  reduce sediment chemical nutrient and toxic pollutants  provide shading to maintain desirable water temperatures  provide habitat for wildlife  protect wetland resources from harmful intrusion  and generally preserve the ecological integrity of the wetland area c frequently flooded areas floodplains and other areas subject to flooding perform important hydrologic functions and may present a risk to persons and property floodplains help to store and convey storm water and flood water  recharge ground water  provide important areas for riparian habitat  and serve as areas for recreation education and scientific study development within floodplain areas can be hazardous to those inhabiting such development and to those living upstream and downstream floods also cause substantial damage to public and private property that result in significant costs to the public and individuals city of redmond  redmond zoning rmc title 21  d critical aquifer recharge areas potable water is an essential lifesustaining element aquifer recharge areas provide a source of potable water and contribute to stream discharge during periods of low flow certain portions of the citys planning area are susceptible to contamination of drinking water and watercourse supplies infiltration of pollutants soil to ground water aquifers wellhead protection zones 1 2 and 3 are designated as critical aquifer recharge areas under the provisions of the growth management act rcw a and are established based on proximity to and travel time of groundwater to the citys public water source wells e geologically hazardous areas geologically hazardous areas include areas susceptible to erosion sliding earthquake or other geological events they pose a threat to the health and safety of citizens when incompatible commercial residential or industrial development is sited in or near areas of significant hazard some geological hazards can be reduced or mitigated by engineering design or modified construction so that risks to health and safety are acceptable when technology cannot reduce risks to acceptable levels building in geologically hazardous areas should be avoided 4 identification
