increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes if inadequately or improperly managed this stormwater runoff can deplete groundwater resources and increase flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition  this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants  increases of stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollutants have occurred in the past as a result of land development and contribute to the degradation of the water resources of the township of waterford  all lands of the township of waterford lie within the pinelands area and therefore development in the township of waterford is subject to the requirements of the pinelands

board 7 no tree is to support any scaffolding signs temporary utility or any other device h planting procedure any vegetation delivered to a site which is not planted immediately shall be heeledin to prevent desiccation trees and bushes should be planted according to the following recommended horticultural procedures 1 plantings should be wellformed and healthy nursery grown stock the root ball should be inspected to ensure that it is undamaged of good quality soil and that it encompasses the entire root system  17672 insurance  17672  2 planting should take place when trees and bushes are dormant because transplanting during this period greatly increases the chances of success 3 planting holes should be dug two times as wide and 1 12 times as deep as the root ball topsoil and subsoil should be mixed thoroughly with sphagnum peat moss or according to the recommendations of the county agricultural agent and a layer six inches to seven inches of the mix placed in the bottom of the hole fertilizer should not be added to the soil mix since it can burn new tender roots slowing down the growth of the plant or even killing it the soil in the bottom of the hole should be tamped down without compacting it 4 plantings should be positioned in the planting hole so that trunks are straight and the base is at the finished grade of the new location and at the same depth as it was when it was growing roots should be spread evenly throughout the hole and soil added carefully 5 the backfilled soil should be tamped in place and the hole filled to the top of the root ball the added soil should be tamped gently but not compacted and a ring of soil two inches to three inches high should be formed around the edge of the planting hole to aid in watering 6 plantings should be watered with a fertilizerwater solution the amount of fertilizer depending on an analysis watering should be thorough and done slowly and gently to avoid damage to the soil structure 7 saucers shall be designed to catch and hold the maximum amount of water either from natural precipitation or irrigation and shall be a minimum of four inches higher than the finished grade the area within the watering saucer should be filled to a depth of two inches to three inches with mulch saucers placed on slopes shall be level at the top and perpendicular to the tree trunk 8 tree trunks should be coated with an insecticide to reduce the chances of attack by borers the specific insecticide can be recommended by the county agricultural agent 9 all newly planted trees and shrubs should be pruned balled and burlapped and containergrown plants should be shaped lightly and have broken and damaged branches removed bare root plants require much heavier pruning to reduce the water demand by the top of the plant in order to compensate for the roots lost when the plants were dug up onethird to 12 of the leaf area should be removed by thinning the branches and reducing their length pruning should retain the natural form of the tree or shrub  the central leader or top of a newly planted tree should never be removed since this will destroy its natural growth habit  17672 waterford code  17672  10 if properly planted shrubs will not have to be staked although oversized bushes may need some support trees should be staked in accordance with good nursery practice 11 special planting techniques may be necessary when planting in heavy poorly drained or sandy soils recommendations of the county agricultural agent should be followed 12 after planting an adequate supply of water and even amount of moisture shall be maintained plant conditions should be carefully observed and if the soil is dry three inches to six inches beneath the surface water should be added immediately the water should be applied slowly preferably irrigation so that it soaks in and does not run off as a general rule plantings in welldrained soils should be watered one inch per week and those in lighter sandy soils two inches per week except during periods of heavy rainfall 13 dead or dying trees which have been transplanted by virtue of the requirements of this section shall be replaced by the developer during the next recommended planting season i staking procedures trees over six feet in height must be staked in the following manner 1 two stakes shall be driven a minimum of two feet into undisturbed soil

property adopted 10122011 by   2301 purpose the township of waterford finds and declares that the resolution of the conflict between the right of the smoker to smoke and the right of the nonsmoker to breathe clean air involves a determination of when and where rather than whether a smoker may legally smoke it is not the public policy of the township of waterford to deny anyone the right to smoke however the township of waterford finds that in government buildings owned or leased by the township of waterford and on all public property owned or leased by the township of waterford the right of the nonsmoker to breathe clean air supersedes the right of the smoker to smoke in addition to the deleterious effects upon smokers tobacco smoke is at least an annoyance and a nuisance to a substantial percentage of the nonsmoking public and a substantial health hazard to a smaller segment of the nonsmoking public furthermore smoking creates a substantial health hazard to the youth of the township who may be participating in activities in buildings or properties owned or leased by the township therefore the purpose of this chapter is to protect the interest of nonsmokers in public buildings and on public property owned or leased by the township and to allow smokers the right to smoke only in designated areas established by the township  2302 definitions as used in this chapter the following terms shall have the meanings indicated public building  any building or portion of a building owned or leased by the township of waterford public property  any real property or portion
