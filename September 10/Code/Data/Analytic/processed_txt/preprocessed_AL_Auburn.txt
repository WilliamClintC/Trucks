authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the city of auburn alabama does ordain as follows  92011 findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city of auburn alabama are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities  92011 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  2 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  3 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion  4 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and 5 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  92011 objectives the objectives of this article are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  3 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  4 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  5 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  6 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  and 7 to ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area  92011 division 2  general provisions lands to which this article applies this article shall apply to all areas of special flood

residential land use to higher residential densities and smallscale commercial office and institutional use has occurred in a haphazard manner much of it prior to enactment of current zoning regulations this district provides regulations that permit redevelopment of an urban character it provides for intermediate residential densities and necessary commercial and institutional uses the rdd is designed to target areas where a combination of public investment in capital improvements and publicprivate actions to renew and redevelop land and structures will stabilize transitional neighborhoods thereby reducing the cost of growth in auburn the rdd may not accommodate a substantially larger population as a result of redevelopment but the character stability and vitality of the district are projected to improve immensely like the cdd this district allows many and varied uses while placing emphasis on minimizing or buffering any nuisances between uses this therefore imposes

expenditures this district provides regulations that permit development of both urban and suburban character it provides for low to moderatedensity residential development and for necessary commercial and institutional uses iii5 the cdd is designed to minimize the costs of extending or expanding public services it is a planned logical accommodation of growth and is intended to serve areas suitable for development and to avoid unsuitable areas uses that are so large as to be of regional importance are not permitted by right because these uses require specialized and different evaluation and have special locational considerations which may make a separate zoning district appropriate major uses such as a regional shopping center will be considered as conditional uses manufactured home parks commercial support uses and road service uses are permitted conditionally and industrial uses are not permitted the cdd allows many and varied uses while placing the emphasis on minimizing or buffering any nuisances between uses segregation of uses has never provided adequate protection especially at the boundaries of use districts this the likelihood  and desirability  of considerable

circulation between properties and uses 30416 industrial district i this district is intended to accommodate industrial areas that must be segregated because of negative impacts that cannot be made compatible with other uses application of performance standards the creation of this separate district for industrial use recognizes not only nuisances but also infrastructure and operational incompatibilities between its permitted uses and those of other districts accordingly the standards for this district are designed to accommodate intensive industrial uses that generate nuisances which either cannot be handled by technology or which are nearly impossible to police locational criteria for this district focus on transportation requiring that sites have access to a railroad an airport or a major expressway 30417 planned development district pdd this district is intended to provide an opportunity for a land development process with the greatest flexibility available to the developer consistent with the provisions of these regulations and the provisions included in the master development plan for the subject property the pdd designation may be requested and considered

assign the appropriate zoning designation article iv general regulations introduction the purpose of the regulations contained in this to allow maximum utilization of land while insuring against detrimental impacts on the environment neighboring properties and the public interest this insurance is provided by separating the incorporated area of the city of auburn into 19 zoning districts and

developed on a particular parcel only if that use meets performance standards which have been enacted to insure against the use causing or having the potential to cause the negative impacts mentioned above the format of the regulations in this particularly in this differs somewhat from that of traditional zoning ordinances because performance zoning requires that consideration be given to site parcel characteristics and the range of impacts that any land use may have use regulations identify the category of use and define the specific uses shown in table 41  table of permitted uses table 41 indicate which land uses may locate by right by conditional use or are not permitted in each zoning district in addition provides special developments standards for uses that are permitted or

a landowner or his representative obtain permits from alabama department of environmental management adem or the u s army corp of engineers for proposed impact to the stream or stream buffers then these approved mitigation impacts and plans would supersede the applicable requirements of these sections of the ordinance the regulations that these permits do not affect shall be applicable to the proposed development site reclamation of undeveloped land in the event that construction of a development has not begun in accordance with the provisions of this or has not been completed within one year of initiation said development shall be reviewed by the planning commission at its next regular meeting following the expiration of the oneyear period at this meeting the planning commission

installation of streets utility lines and stormwater management facilities  laying structural foundations  and completion of any stage of a development approved under a staging plan pursuant to a however the clearing and grubbing of land in the absence of other improvements shall not by itself constitute evidence of reasonable progress upon a determination that reasonable progress is not being made the planning commission may require the owner of the development site to restore the land to the same condition that existed prior to the initiation of the development if such restoration is not feasible the city engineer and the planning director shall determine and prescribe an acceptable condition or degree of reclamation  at the very least the site shall be sodded or planted in grass and

and large enough to address the open space characteristics cited throughout  no dwelling unit shall be located more than 750 feet from designated open space the planning commission may waive this distance requirement where the developer proposes a major recreational facility which will occupy at least 50 percent of the required open space for the development no more than ten 10 percent of the dwelling units in the development may be occupied before this facility is completed and available for use where intervening nonrecreational properties separate a dwelling unit from an open space area

the open space areas shall be used only as provided in the site plan shall note the entity or entities having ownership and maintenance responsibility openspace areas may be owned preserved and maintained as required by this any of the following mechanisms or combinations thereof a common ownership of the open space by a homeowners association which assumes full responsibility for its maintenance b deedrestricted private ownership that shall prevent development andor subsequent subdivision of the openspace land and provide the maintenance responsibility this arrangement shall be noted on the site plan andor subdivision plat full and proper legal documentation shall be submitted to the planning director prior to commencement of development activities land use intensity classification and bufferyards and structure height all land uses that are permitted by this been assigned a land use intensity class designation this classification system separates uses on the basis of the type and degree of nuisance or negative impact they are likely to impose on land uses adjacent to them iv43 bufferyards are required to protect one class of use from adverse impacts caused by a use in another class or to ameliorate the impact two uses in the same class may have on one another bufferyards between two uses in the same land use intensity class are not required in this classes vxi because the principal intent is to buffer residential uses found only in classes iiv from nonresidential uses however the planning commission may require bufferyards between two uses of the same intensity in classes vxi or between two uses of different intensity where bufferyards are not required by the it appears that problems will result from placing unlike land uses side by side without a bufferyard this regulation benefits both the developer and the adjoining landowners because it allows the developer several options from which to choose in developing the property while insuring each neighbor adequate protection regardless of the developers choice each land use is listed in one or more use intensity classes a use must meet all the standards specified for that use in table 44 the standards that apply to the highest intensity class for a use shall be the maximum intensity permitted for that use there are standards that set maximum density impervious surface ratio floor area and height steeples bell towers clock towers cupolas and similar ornamentalarchitectural features may exceed structure height by a maximum of 25% of the height limit of the respective zoning district chimneys ventilators utility service structures solar panels flag poles fire escapes stairway enclosures or elevator enclosures may exceed height limit by 12 feet exclusions from structure height are parapet walls limited to a height of four feet and balustrades or railings that rise less than six feet from the floor or roof from which they extend exclusions shall not exceed in cross sectional area 25 percent of the ground floor area of the building exclusions from structure height shall not include accessory rooftop structures such as greenhouses pigeon houses enclosed recreational or commercial amenities and similar structures unenclosed accessory rooftop recreational amenities such as swimming pools and jogging tracks shall be permitted where the amenity exclusive of safety railings does not exceed the height limit of the respective zoning district land use intensity class standards in keeping with the concept that performance should be the relevant measure of any land use regulations the following uses according to their respective impacts all uses within a use class are considered to have an equal impact on neighboring uses a developer may develop at an intensity that will minimize nuisances to neighbors or provide a denser bufferyard if the land is developed at greater intensities the impacts of greater intensity may include greater impervious surface coverage with associated increased runoff heat generation reduced percolation and open space increased bulk and height of buildings increased traffic with associated noise and congestion signs and exterior lighting visible from neighboring property late hours of operation and other nuisances thus for example an office use on any lot may meet the standards of intensity classes v vi vii viii or ix see table 44 the range of intensity classes open to a use does not affect whether it can locate on its lot but only how it can develop on that lot performance standards are specified for each intensity class  exceeding any single standard in an intensity class moves a use to the next higher intensity class in the event that a use does not appear in the next higher intensity class it may

nuisances between adjacent land uses or between a land use and a public road the purpose of the buffer is to separate different land uses from each other in order to eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as dirt litter noise glare of lights signs and unsightly buildings or parking areas or to provide spacing to reduce adverse impacts of noise odor or danger from fires or explosions in addition to creating a separation a buffer determines the building setback for all performance developments except where other setbacks are more restrictive a structure in a performance development may require a setback greater than the width of the bufferyard depending on the height of the structure this determination shall be made in accordance with the requirements set forth in iv47 the purpose of the planting is to create a visual separation between uses and to enhance the beauty of the city this is accomplished protection and planting of trees particularly those trees recognized herein as canopy and understory trees the intent is to derive all the benefits of having trees shrubs and other plant materials among the benefits are minimizing temperature elevation reducing noise and wind reduction reducing stormwater runoff and flooding preventing soil erosion producing of oxygen fostering air quality dioxide absorption providing shelter and food for birds and other wildlife and softening the visual impact of development from public view and adjacent property all these benefits contribute to a higher quality of life and enhance the appeal and economic value of both

for all development adjacent to all streets general landscaping requirements 42201 landscaping requirements this the general planting required on a particular development site a tree inches per acre system shall be used to determine the number and types of trees required on a development site table 48 specifies the required inches per acre and the required number of shrubs based on the size of the development site the procedure for calculating the number and types of trees required on a development site is as follows a determining the total tree inches required on a development site to obtain the required number and type of planting materials find the tree inches that correspond with the acreage of the development site if the acreage of the development site is not a whole number round the acreage to the nearest whole number in order to obtain the total tree inches multiply the tree inches by the actual acreage of the development site round all numbers to the nearest whole number this number is the total inches of trees to be planted on the development site if the property abuts a conventional residential subdivision see for additional tree inches to be added to the total inches of trees calculated b determining the minimum number of canopy and understory trees before determining the number of canopy and understory trees a  ratio canopy tree inches to understory tree inches iv51 shall be applied to the total tree inches once tree inches for each type have been determined the tree inches will be converted into the number of trees to be required on the site canopy trees multiply the total inches of trees by sixty percent 60% to get the tree inches to be devoted to canopy trees to convert the tree inches to actual tree count the inches for canopy trees should be divided by 2 which is the minimum caliper for canopy trees the quotient is the number of canopy trees to be planted on the development site understory trees take the total tree inches and multiply it by forty percent 40% to get the tree inches to be devoted to understory trees to convert the inches to actual tree count the inches for understory trees should be divided by one 1 which is the minimum caliper for understory trees this number is the actual number of understory trees to be planted on the development site again this number may be diminished by any applicable tree preservation credits see  example 15 acres  53 inches tree inches for 2 acres   795 round to 80 inches of trees 80  60%   48 inches 48  20 caliper   24 canopy trees 80  40%   32 inches 32  10 caliper   32 understory trees the owner would be required to plant 24 canopy trees and 32 understory trees for a total of 56 trees if the owner decides to plant all canopy trees he would plant 40 canopy trees and no understory trees on the development site c minimum standards an owner shall be allowed to exceed the minimum number of trees on a development site as long as the total required tree inches have been met the total tree inches required on a development site may be met by planting all canopy trees but not by planting all understory trees the maximum number of understory trees shall not exceed forty percent 40% of the total tree inches d shrubs the number of shrubs to be planted on the development site is found on table 48 the number of shrubs is determined by the size of the development site if the acreage of the development site is not a whole number round the acreage to the nearest whole number in order to obtain the number of shrubs per acre then multiply the number of shrubs per acre by the actual acreage of the development site the product is the number of shrubs to be planted on the development site example 15  84 shrubs for 2 acres   126 shrubs e landscaping near utilities canopy trees shall not be placed within 10 feet of existing or proposed underground utilities or on designated utility easements 42202 street frontage landscaping requirements required buffer width see table 47 canopy trees inches per 100 feet understory trees inches per 100 feet shrubs number of per 100 feet 10 feet 3 inches 3 inches 8 15 feet 4 inches 4 inches 10 sites with narrow street frontages in proportion to the total acreage may be granted a waiver by the planning director or his designee the applicant is required to request the waiver in letter form with the submitted landscape plans iv52 existing trees located in the street frontage buffer area may receive credits if the trees are protected in accordance with the required number of canopy tree inches must be installed unless the planning director or his or her designee deems that the canopy tree will conflict with utilities in such cases the total number of tree inches may be installed using understory trees example a street has a linear frontage of 250 feet and requires a 15 foot buffer using the table above they would be required to have at least five 5 2inch canopy trees ten 10 1inch understory trees and 25 shrubs this would equate to 20 tree inches in the bufferyard including 10 canopy and 10 understory tree inches using the tree inch method the applicant could use larger trees to reduce number of total trees required if the applicant used 4inch canopy trees and 2inch understory trees he or she could install three 3 canopy trees and five 5 understory trees furthermore the applicant could install five 5 4inch canopy trees and not be required to install any understory trees should a street master tree plan be implemented for a particular street which the development site fronts  the plantings from the street tree master plan will supersede the street frontage requirements for that particular frontage 42203 residential buffer landscaping requirements additional planting materials shall be added to the landscaping requirements for property that abuts a conventional subdivision twenty 20 tree inches per 100 linear feet of buffer area shall be added to the inches per acre requirements for any property lines abutting conventional residential development the  ratio shall be applied to the tree inches to determine the number of canopy versus understory trees to be planted shrubbery shall be provided between plantings at thirtyfive 35 shrubs per 100 feet planting materials for a residential buffer shall be installed in the buffer area along the property lines abutting a conventional residential subdivision under no circumstances can these inches be allocated to other areas on the development site development sites which are separated from conventional subdivisions by the railroad rightofway are exempt from this requirement 42204 offstreet parking landscaping requirements wherever a bufferyard required under overlaps or coincides with a parking area as defined in this the bufferyard shall take precedence  planting required under this be placed in another location existing canopy understory and shrub species may be counted as contributing to the total landscaping required provided they are located within areas addressed by this type and quantity of plant materials that satisfy the requirements of this specified in plant materials landscape areas shall be provided in the interior parking area to break the expanse of pavement provide visual relief and minimize temperature elevation from the expanse of asphalt landscape areas shall consist of planter islands planter strips or peninsula types in order to count toward the offstreet parking landscape requirements a planter island planter strip or peninsula shall have a minimum area of threehundred four 304 square feet with a minimum width of nine 9 feet hereafter referred to as contributing landscape areas peninsulas may be designed within or adjacent to the interior parking area the square footage of each planter island planter strip or peninsula within the parking lot must be shown  all contributing landscape areas should be designated on the landscape plan by shading or otherwise differentiated from any noncontributing landscape area foundation landscaping landscaping immediately adjacent to building shall not be considered interior parking area landscaping figure 41 graphically illustrates the area that constitutes the interior parking area and the landscape area types the total area provided for offstreet parking landscaping shall comply with one of the following options option 1 one 1 contributing landscape island is required for every sixteen 16 parking spaces in a parking lot the requirements of this apply to all offstreet parking areas containing twelve 12 or more paved parking spaces if an existing parking lot is expanded or improved to add twelve 12 or more spaces it shall comply with the offstreet parking landscaping requirements of this ordinance within the expanded or improved portion iv53 option 2 a minimum of 10% of the interior parking lot shall be landscaped the boundary of the interior parking area must be shown on the landscape plan the interior parking lot area is that area inside of the parking lot curb or edge of pavement consisting of parking spaces drive aisles driveways and immediately adjacent areas including all landscape areas the maximum distance in any direction between islands and peninsulas shall be one hundred eighty 180 feet and one hundred twenty 120 feet for planter strips measured from the closest landscaped planting area curb edge a minimum of one 1 canopy tree shall be required for and must be planted in each contributing landscaped island or peninsula regardless of the tree credits received larger contributing landscape areas shall require one 1 additional canopy tree for each additional three hundred four 304 square feet of area ie a six hundred eight 608 square foot contributing landscape area requires two 2 canopy trees any additional landscaped areas beyond the required number may be planted with understory trees andor shrubs one 1 canopy tree per onehundred 100 linear feet shall be planted in continuous planter strips the remaining area shall be landscaped with shrubs andor other ground covering in some instances these requirements of may require planting materials in excess of those required by existing canopy trees located elsewhere on the development site shall not count as contributing to the landscaping requirement for parking areas all planting areas shall be protected from vehicular intrusion by the installation of curbing or other wheel stops parked vehicles may hang over the interior landscaped area no more than two and a half feet as long as curbing or other wheel stops are provided to insure no greater overhang or penetration of the landscaped area the city of auburn planning department andor planning commission may vary the minimum offstreet parking landscaping requirements if specific circumstances andor site conditions warrant such action under no circumstances can the landscaped areas be less than ninety 90 square feet with a minimum width of five 5 feet the type and quantity of plant materials that satisfy the requirements of this specified in plant materials 42205 placement of plants and structures the exact placement of required plants and structure types shall be the decision of each user  however no less than 40% of the general landscape material installed on a development site must be located in a
