this chapter b scope the provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area including but not limited to the subdivision of land  filling grading and other site improvements and utility installations  construction alteration remodeling enlargement improvement replacement repair relocation or demolition of buildings structures and facilities that are exempt from the florida building   placement installation or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings  installation or replacement of tanks  placement of recreational vehicles  installation of swimming pools  and any other development c findings of fact the city commission hereby finds and declares that 1 because of variations in rainfall and the amount of stormwater runoff flooding is a natural recurring phenomenon 2 the floodprone areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life property damage health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which could adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 3 these flood losses are caused in part by the cumulative effect of obstructions and fill in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in floodprone areas of uses vulnerable to damage by floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damages 4 flooding and lands that are subject to flooding floodprone lands serve the following important functions in the hydrologic cycle and ecological system a floodprone lands provide natural storage and conveyance of floodwaters  b the water on flooded lands may provide recharge to groundwater and is a basic source of flow to rivers streams and estuaries  c temporary storage of surface waters on floodprone lands regulates flood elevations and the timing velocity and rate of flood discharges  d floodprone lands and the natural vegetation thereon maintain water quality by reducing erosion removing nutrients and other pollutants and allowing sediment to settle 5 development of floodprone lands is inconsistent with their natural functions and improper management of floodwaters have the following significant adverse impacts on the health safety and welfare of the community a the owners of homes and business structures located in frequently flooded areas and their customers guests employees children and future generations are subjected to unreasonable risk of personal injury and property damage b expensive and dangerous search and rescue and disaster relief operations must be conducted when developed properties are flooded c roads and utilities associated with development are subject to damage from flooding at great expense to taxpayers and rate payers d flooding of developed properties leads to demands for government to construct expensive and often environmentally damaging projects to control floodwaters e loss of natural water storage capacity leads to reduction in the available water supply and a reduction in the stormwater treatment effectiveness in these areas f the level velocity frequency and duration of flooding on other lands are often increased when floodwaters are obstructed diverted displaced or channelized g water quality is degraded freshwater inflows to estuaries are disrupted and valuable wetland and wildlife habitat is lost h property values are lowered and economic activity is disrupted by damaging floods d coordination with the florida building chapter is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the florida building cited asce 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the florida building e warning the degree of flood protection required by this chapter and the florida building as amended by this community is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations larger floods can and will occur flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes this chapter does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas will be free from flooding or flood damage the flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of title 44
