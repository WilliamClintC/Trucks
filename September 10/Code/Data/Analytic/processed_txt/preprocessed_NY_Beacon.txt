health services act of the mental hygiene law of the state of new york municipal identification program  421 legislative findings intent and purpose a the city council finds that many residents of the city of beacon oftentimes do not have access to various forms of identification and thus have difficulty obtaining services such as bank accounts access to health care services as well as access to publicgovernment buildings this barrier leaves thousands of individuals including immigrants homeless people transgender people senior citizens young people and those who have been formerly incarcerated without access to critical services it is the intent of the city council to build the city of beacons standing as a welcoming and inclusive center for all residents without regard to a persons race national origin religion sex sexual orientation gender identity disability immigration housing or financial status b residents lack of access to acceptable forms of identification also raises public safety concerns for the city residents without access to bank accounts often carry large amounts of money on their person or store it in their home making them targets for crime in addition residents who cannot produce proof of identity are often reluctant to report crimes to the police that they suffer or witness studies show that immigrant populations in particular are victimized by crime at rates similar to or greater than the general population but immigrant populations report crime at lower rates than the general population this underreporting of crime poses a serious public safety problem and erodes the ability of law enforcement to function effectively in the city c a city of beacon identification card would serve to reduce the impact of the abovementioned conditions improve public safety and enable all city of beacon residents to participate more fully in and become an integral part of the community a city of beacon identification card

their support for the implementation of a drugfree zone program including the installation of appropriate signs around school grounds  1012 planning and implementation the beacon city council requests that the public works department immediately begin the planning and implementation of this program by consulting with the appropriate city departments and other agencies to allow for the enforcement of the provisions of the penal law and the imposition of the increased penalty provisions set forth therein upon the proper creation of these drugfree zones 40editors note the preamble to this resolution read as follows whereas the proliferation of drugs in our society is recognized as one of the most threatening and dangerous problems being faced by our youth  and whereas the beacon city council supports programs which educate our young people about the dangers of illegal narcotics and which seek to prevent abuse problems before they get started  and whereas the new york state division of substance abuse services supports recently enacted legislation which allows municipalities to in effect create drugfree zones in areas frequented by children by providing for increased penalties for the sale of illegal drugs within 1000 feet of school grounds  and whereas such drugfree zones are intended to create a zone of safety for school children and to give moral support to young people who want to resist the use of illegal drugs  and whereas the effective application of this program would require the cooperation of a variety of government agencies including the police the courts the district attorney and the public and private school systems now therefore be it  1011 drugs  1012  dumpsters and clothing bin containers general references garbage rubbish and refuse

significant effect on the environment and do not require environmental impact statements type ii actions are listed on the environmental clearance form in  10715 herein 3 type iii actions or classes of actions are actions which are neither type i nor type ii and which may have a significant effect on the environment if they can reasonably be expected by the agency to lead to one of the following consequences a a substantial adverse change to ambient air or water quality or noise levels or in solid waste production drainage erosion or flooding  1075 environmental quality review  1076  b the

owners to recognize their responsibility to ensure that activities occurring on their property conform to the law and do not adversely affect their neighborhoods unduly burden the citys resources and

health safety and welfare of the public residing within this jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in  1901 hereof this chapter seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives a land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  c clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation  e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow  f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality  g stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  h the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety i regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development  1901 slaughterhouses  1902   1903 statutory authority in accordance with  10 of the municipal home rule law of the state of new york the city of

department while evaluating a facility will rely on experience assistance from local health department officials and the crossconnection control program manual h existing inuse backflow prevention devices any existing backflow prevention device shall be allowed by the department to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow prevention device or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health where the degree of hazard has increased as in the case of a residential installation converting to a business establishment any existing backflow prevention device must be upgraded to a reducedpressureprinciple device or a reducedpressure principle device must be installed in the event that no backflow prevention device was present i periodic testing 1 all testers of backflow prevention devices shall be approved by the nysdoh pursuant to of of the new york state sanitary nycrr  2 the testing of backflow prevention

to the requirements of the nysdoh and the dcdoh test results shall be submitted to the department within 30 days of the completion of such testing late submissions of annual test results shall be subject to an administrative processing fee in the amount of $25 3 any backflow prevention device which fails during a periodic test will be repaired or replaced when repairs are necessary upon completion of the repair the device will be retested at the owners expense to ensure correct operation highhazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow prevention device fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately in other  21912 beacon code  21912  situations a compliance date of not more than 30 days after the test date will be established the owner is responsible for spare parts repair tools or a replacement device parallel installation of two devices is an effective means of the owner ensuring uninterrupted water service during testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such continuity 4 backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than specified above in cases where there is a history of test failures and the water supply operator feels that due to the degree of hazard involved additional testing is warranted cost of the additional testing will be borne by the owner 5 testing is not

the homeowner as deemed necessary by the department 2 the owners must be aware that installation of a residential dual check assembly results in a potential closed plumbing system within the residence as such provisions may have to be made by the owners to provide for thermal expansion within the closed loop system ie the installation of thermal expansion devices andor pressure relief valves k strainers the department strongly recommends that all new retrofit installations of reducedpressureprinciple devices and double check valve backflow prevention devices include the installation of strainers located immediately upstream of the backflow prevention device the installation of strainers will preclude the fouling of the backflow prevention devices due to both foreseen and unforeseen circumstances occurring to the water supply system such as water main repairs water main breaks fires periodic cleaning and flushing of mains etc these occurrences may stir up debris within the water main that will cause fouling of backflow prevention devices installed without the benefit of strainers l penalties for offenses  corrective action 1 any person violating any provision of this chapter

districts one of the essential characteristics of a healthy downtown business district is a high degree of continuity between adjacent retail and service uses so that consumers can conveniently walk

this case residential uses residences which are located at the front of the ground floor of the buildings on main street are believed to be more injurious to the health and vitality of this business
