provisions the town of livermore falls may institute any appropriate action including injunction or other proceedings to prevent restrain or abate violations hereof article ix sewer extensions public sewer extensions may be constructed by the town under public contract if in the opinion of the selectmen the number of properties to be served by such extensions warrants its cost under this arrangement the property owner shall pay for and install the building sewer from the public sewer to his residence or place of business in accordance with the 23 requirements of property owners may propose sewer extensions within the town by drafting a written petition signed by a majority of the benefiting property owners and filing with the selectmen the cost of such extensions may be assessed to the benefited property owners in any manner determined by the selectmen if the town does not elect to construct a sewer extension under public contract the property owner builder or developer may construct the necessary sewer extension if such extension is approved by the selectmen in accordance with the requirements of they must pay for the entire installation including all expenses incidental thereto each building sewer must be installed and inspected as previously required and the inspection fees shall be paid therefore design of sewers shall be as specified in  the installation of the sewer extension shall be subject to periodic inspection by the superintendent and the expenses for this inspection shall be paid for by the owner builder or developer the superintendents decisions shall be final in matter of quality and methods of construction the sewer as constructed must pass the exfiltration test required in before it is to be used the cost of sewer extension thus made shall be absorbed by the developers or the property owners including all building sewers all extensions to the sanitary sewer system owned and maintained by the town shall be properly designed in accordance with the recommended standard for sewage works as adapted by the great lakes upper mississippi river board of state sanitary engineers plans and specifications for sewer extensions shall be submitted to and approval obtained from the superintendent before construction may proceed the design of sewers must anticipate and allow for flows from all possible future extensions or developments within the immediate drainage area sewer design shall be in accordance with the following provisions pipe material shall be pvc minimum classification standards to be sdr 35 no standard strength clay pipe nor nonreinforced concrete pipe shall be used minimum internal pipe diameter shall be 8 inches joint preparation and assembly shall be in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations wye branch fittings shall be installed for connection to buildings sewers in accordance with pipe shall be firmly and evenly bedded on a minimum of 6 inches of screened gravel with stone size not exceeding 1 inch 24 manholes shall be constructed at all changes in slope or alignment or at intervals not exceeding 400 linear feet the manholes shall be constructed with a poured 3000 psi concrete base 8 inches thick steel toweled concrete or mortar bench walls and inverts and precast four foot diameter concrete manhole barrel sections with tapered top sections as specified by astm c 478 the manhole frame and cover shall be the standard design of the town and shall be set with no less than one two inch concrete riser underneath to allow for later adjustment to elevation all joints shall be sealed against infiltration all public sewers shall satisfy requirements of a final exfiltration test before they will be approved and sewage flow accepted from them by the town this test can either be conducted hydraulically or pneumatically the hydraulic test consists of filling the pipe with water to provide a head of at least 5 feet  above the top of the pipe or 5 feet  above the ground water whichever is higher at the highest point of the pipe line under test and then measuring the loss of water from the line by the amount which must be added to maintain at the original level in this test the line must remain filled for least 24 hours prior to taking of measurements exfiltration shall be measured by the drop of water level in a stand pipe with closed bottom end or in one of the sewer manholes available for convenient measuring when a standpipe and plug arrangement is used in the upper manhole of a line under test there must be some positive method of releasing entrapped air in the sewer prior to taking measurements the length of sewer shall in no event exceed 1000 feet  for either type of test and in the case of sewers laid on a steep grade may be limited by the maximum allowable internal pressure on the pipe and joints at the lower end of the line the test period wherein the measurements are taken shall not be less than two hours in either test and the maximum allowable rate of leakage shall not exceed 100 gallons per mile of pipe per 24 hours per inch of nominal pipe diameter for purposes of determining this maximum allowable rate of leakage manholes shall be considered as a section of 48 inch diameter pipe 5 feet long and the equivalent leakage of allowance shall be 45 gallons per manhole per 24 hours the pneumatic test consists of blanking both ends of the pipe with air locks and introducing air mechanism in one of the air lock units to 35 pounds per square inch pressure with a known permeability of the pipe 25 the only variable is the pipe diameter and the minimum allowable time in minutes for a 10 pound per square inch pressure drop is found by multiplying the pipe diameter in inches by  if leakage exceeds a specified amount by either test the necessary repairs or replacements required shall be made to permanently reduce the leakage to within the specified limit all extensions of public sewers constructed at the expense of the property owner builder or developer after approval and acceptance by the superintendent shall become the property of the town and shall thereafter be maintained by the town said sewers after their acceptance by the town shall be guaranteed against defects in materials or workmanship for 18 months the guarantee shall be in a form provided for by the town at the sole discretion of the town a completion bond or certified check may be demanded as part of the guarantee no builder or developer shall be issued a building permit for a new dwelling or structure requiring sanitary facilities within the town unless a suitable and approved method of waste disposal is proposed all new developments shall be provided with an approved system of sanitary sewers pump station design
