enterprise zones from the curp in 2016 lincoln way enterprise zone and central clinton enterprise zone as such the lincoln way enterprise zone and the central clinton enterprise zone are no longer designated as urban revitalization areas two other areas previously identified as enterprise zones are now designated as commercialindustrial revitalization areas  those areas include lyons business and technology park urban revitalization area and the manufacturing meadows urban revitalization area bthe city previously designated the new directions area as a separate urban revitalization area however in 2016 the city council determined that the desired level of revitalization had been attained in that area and therefore the city removed the new directions area from the curp as such the new directions area is no longer designated as an urban revitalization area cwith the adoption of amendment no 1 to the plan in 201 the city council determined that the desired level of revitalization has been attained in two of the commercialindustrial revitalization areas the margaret place urban revitalization area and the margaret place east urban revitalization area therefore the city removed the
