but it is also a fundamental and important truth that with each new house and each cut tree the environment and ecology of the town changes therefore the control and maintenance of a reasonable balance between new development and the preservation of the towns natural resources is a legitimate area for public concern and legislation it is therefore the intent of the town that this article

proposal for apartment development will be reviewed separately and judged by standards designed to protect both the special quality of the site and its environs and the town and its environment
