 planning and zoning thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances

users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 cfr subchapter n parts 405471 a where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the director may imposeequivalent concentration or mass limits b when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users c when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the director shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr 4036e da ciu may obtain a netgross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this note see 40 cfr 40315 1categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city upon request of the industrial user the applicable calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the requirements of subsection f1d 2 hereof are met       2 criteria aeither the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters bcredit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere c credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result ewhen a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the  director the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsections f1e1a below 1to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must aemploy or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  c provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the long term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  d not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and e have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits 2 an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must amaintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  b continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  c continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the director whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in paragraph f 1e1c of this notification of a revised production rate the director will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and d continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraphs f1 e1a of this long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit        3 when developing equivalent mass limits the director a will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  b upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and c may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment the industrial user must also be in compliance with the prohibition of bypass f the director may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the director g once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived h many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or 4day average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation note see 40 cfr 4036c8 i any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the director within two 2 business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the director of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate note see 40 cfr 4036c9 2  state requirements and limitations on discharges

maintenance fund may never have an unencumbered balance of more than twenty percent 20% of the cost of original improvement as adjusted to current costs once the fund has reached the twenty percent 20% maximum assessments will abate until such time as monies are withdrawn from the fund to maintain repair or replace some element of the stormwater management system the annual assessment is determined by dividing the maximum maintenance fund balance by six 6 years the entire maintenance fund amount is apportioned to the lots within the subdivision on a fair and equitable formula in order to establish the appropriate amount to be assessed to each property   upon special request the rate of assessment may be partially abated over the initial five 5 year period following subdivision approval this abatement is to allow developers time to sell individual lots without creating an undue strain on cash flow during the early phases of development beginning with the fifth year of the schedule the assessment is collected at the full rate generally using this assessment schedule where payments in the first five years are partially abated it requires between nine 9 and ten 10 years

subdivided area sooner or later becomes a public responsibility in that roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided the welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many important respects the guidance of land development in harmony with community objectives is therefore a matter of serious public concern and it is in the interest of the public the developer and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards cthese subdivision regulations and the major thoroughfare plan certified copies of which are filed in the office of the county clerk are designed for the harmonious development of the subdivided area for a coordinated
