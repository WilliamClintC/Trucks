ii south lebanon township stormwate management ordinance article i general provisions statement of findings the south lebanon township board of supervisors finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the township and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c a stormwater management plan shall be required for any regulated activity as defined by at both the preliminary and final submittal stages as an integral part of the final stormwater management plan erosion and sediment pollution control measures shall be included and accompanied by an approval letter from the lebanon county conservation district d inadequate maintenance of stormwater facilities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines flood plain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases pollution of water resources e reasonable regulation of connections and discharges to municipal separate stormsewer systems is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment f stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality g federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to obtain a permit for stonnwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant

native vegetation to treat and capture runoff 2 wetlands may be constructed to contain an environment of shallow marsh where pollutants can be removed combination of settling absorption retention plant uptake and biological decomposition wetland designs are best suited for larger watersheds and must be accompanied by a landscaping plan which specifies plan species planting arrangement bed preparation and operationmaintenance requirements additionally wetlands shall be planted with three 3 or more plant species for diversity and survival plus at least fifty 50 percent of the wetland area must be planted anci maintained in plant cover specific wetland types and guidelines are a shallow wetlands these systems are configured with several varying levels of marsh areas containing a meandering water pathway from the forebay to a micropool at the outlet water depths usually range from 6 to 18 b pocket wetlands wetlands for small location where a seasonal high water table is needed to help sustain the water elevations 3 infiltration systems are designed to capture stormwater runoff and infiltrate it into the ground these systems are best adapted for small drainage areas and effectively reduce runoff volume remove many pollutants recharge the groundwater and contribute to maintaining stream baseflows specific infiltration systems types and guidelines are a infiltration trench shallow excavations that are lined with geotextile fabric and filled with stone to create an underground water reservoir which gradually percolates into the surrounding subsoil infiltration trenches are especially useful for connection to roof drains larger trenches will require an under drain to a stormwater conveyance system b infiltration basin south lebanon township stormwater management a large open depression basin which collects stonnwater for percolation the basin surface should be vegetated with deep rooted plants to enhance infiltration soils slope geology and hydrogeology may restrict use of these basins c porous pavement low traffic or overflow parking areas may be designed with porous pavement a porous asphalt layer which pennits runoff to drain into an underground stone area where it can infiltrate into the subsoil d depressed pervious area these facilities are useful for capturing runoff within a parking lot island they are designed lower than the surrounding areas contain permeable soils with a filtration system or a beehive drain and often contain an underdrain for excess runoff plants shrubs and trees enhance performance and aesthetics contributing parking areas require curb cuts curbs with weep holes or similar design to facilitate runoff discharge to the pervious area 4 filtering systems are effective for filtering sediment and other pollutants from runoff by passing it soil sandsoil mix vegetation a structural filter or any combination thereof filtered runoff is then infiltrated or drained to other onsite facilities these systems may be integrated into landscaped areas and parking islands where plantings will add aesthetic enhancements specific filtering systems types and guidelines are a sand filter an underground chamber or bed with sand designed to filter pollutants as water drains with an underdrain system for discharge of the filtered water to a stormwater conveyance system b bioretention system these designs utilize a mixture of sand and permeable soil underneath a planted landscaped depression to collect and treat surface water runoff bioretention areas are especially advantageous for parking lot islands and snow storage location c riparian buffer strip along streams wetlands and lakes an area of land which is vegetated with a combination of trees shrubs and herbaceous plants this land strip is designed to protect the water resource by filtering pollutants improving the habitat and cooling the waterways by shading the riparian buffer strip shall include 100 year flood plain or be a minimum of twenty five 25 feet wide from the edge of the nonnal water level whichever is greater south lebanon township stormwater management d vegetated filter strip these bmps are characterized by grass or low growing vegetation on a uniformly sloped area which is designed to intercept sheet flow water runoff between an impervious surface and the stonnwater conveyance facilities vegetated filter strips reduce water velocities and trap sediment and pollutants they require good vegetation and soil permeability and should be avoided on steep slopes they are best used along small parking lots should be a minimum of twenty 20 feet wide in the direction of water flow and normally are designed equal in size to the impervious area draining to the filter strip e vegetated swale a broad shallow low gradient swale with a dense stand of medium height vegetation which is designed to trap pollutants and promote infiltration f water quality inlet underground boxlike structure such as an oilgrit separator which is used to remove sediment and hydrocarbons from water runoff originating from parking lots and heavy traffic areas with the potential for petroleum discharges these facilities are used close to the source of the runoff and currently include other products such as stormceptor and vortechnics 5 open channels convey filter and percolate stonnwater runoff they are often use as an alternative to or component of a storm sewer system specific open channel types and guidelines are a grass swale grass swales filter pollutants as stormwater runoff is drained to other areas these facilities are best combined with other bmps and may include check dams or minor depressions storage to reduce water velocity and encourage infiltration an underbedding of mixed sand and soil with a pipe or stone underdrain will improve the use of infiltration and ground water recharge b lined channel rip rap concrete or other erosions resistant material may be used to line a channel to prevent

adjusted however so that lots on one 1 side of the street will not be excessively below the street grade b natural drainage  subdivisions shall be designed particularly on land of very gentle slopes to take every advantage of natural grades so that all the land can be drained without excessive grading unless water courses or drainage ways are enclosed the plan shall be adjusted so that rear lot lines shall be approximately parallel to the natural or straightened course and only where such plan is not possible should side lot lines be arranged parallel to an open drainage course easements for

natural features  natural features irregulatities changes in level brooks lakes hilltops and other focal points within the site and distant views outside the subdivision shall be integrated in the design to obtain variations and interest in each neighborhood and more attractive building sites trees topsoil and other natural resources shall be preserved and utilized in the development of the subdivision d driveways  private driveways shall be designed to furnish safe and convenient access with reasonable clear sigh distance at intersection with street steep slopes shall be traversed diagonally to minimize grades driveway grades shall not exceed 15% slope the south lebanon township board of supervisors may require paving of driveways ex ceeding 10% slope to minimize erosion
