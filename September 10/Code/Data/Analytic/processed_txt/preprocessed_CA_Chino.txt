adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific

purpose and intent a in 197 the residents of the city of chino adopted the current mobilehome park rent stabilization ordinance as of the chino municipal adopting the ordinance the residents made the following findings 1 that there was a shortage of spaces for the location of mobilehomes resulting in a low vacancy rate and rising space rents for mobilehome owners 2 that mobilehome owners have invested substantial sums in their mobilehomes and appurtenances 3 that alternate sites for the relocation of mobilehomes are difficult to find 4 that moving and installation of mobilehomes is expensive with possible damage to them 5 that the purpose of that chapter is to protect the owners of mobilehomes from unreasonable space rent increases but recognizing the owners of mobilehome parks were entitled to receive a fair return on their investment 6 and that another purpose of the ordinance is to encourage mobilehome owners to maintain and improve their mobilehomes and to assure that space rent increases do not deter such owners from so doing b the residents of the city of chino find that there continues to be a shortage of mobilehome spaces in the city of chino in the past twenty years no new mobilehome parks have been built in the city of chino while other housing type has continued to be constructed further the population of the city of chino has increased by twelve and one half percent from the 1990 to the 2000 because of this shortage there is a low vacancy rate and rents are presently rising and causing concern among a substantial number of mobilehome park residents because of the high cost of moving mobilehomes and related potential damage to them  the requirements relating to the installation of mobilehomes including permits landscaping and site preparation  the lack of alternative sites for mobilehomes and the substantial investment of mobilehome owners there is an imbalance in the supply of mobilehome park spaces compared to the demand for such spaces resulting in pressure to increase space rents c mobilehome owners are in the unique position of having made a substantial investment in a mobilehome that is situated on land that is rented or leased therefore both the park owner and the mobilehome owner have a financial stake in the relationship additionally because mobilehome park spaces are virtually unavailable and relocating difficult and costly the closure of a mobilehome park or its change of use has serious consequences for mobilehome owners who may find it impossible to relocate a comparable park d the current mobilehome park rent stabilization ordinance has become difficult to administer for a number of reasons including the unwillingness of mobilehome park owners and mobilehome owners to serve as members on the mobilehome park review committee as currently required delays in the hearing process due to the inability to constitute the committee an absence of more clear definitions and standards and the prohibition against amending the ordinance without a vote of the residents of the city of chino e for these reasons among others the residents of the city of chino find and declare the necessity to protect mobilehome owners from unreasonable space rent increases while at the same time recognizing the need of park owners to receive a fair return on their investment in their mobilehome parks in addition the residents of the city of chino find that it is necessary to permit the city council to amend this ordinance from time to time depending on changes in circumstances that are not now foreseeable

hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations  2008   findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city of chino county of san bernardino are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative affect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss  2008   legislative purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone mudslide ie mudflow or flood related erosion areas these regulations are designed to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruptions  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  g ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  2008   methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes regulations to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas  2008   definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall

outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only  2008   nature of variances the issuance of variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actual risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of this chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of his chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the governing body to help protect the residents and their property from flooding this duty is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements of this chapter should be quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  2008   conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvements and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the planning commission need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to the elevation which the planning commission believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county of san bernardino recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  2008   appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the planning commission shall hold a public hearing and consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors and standards specified in this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the specific plan general plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c variance may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a d are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of the factors of the purposes of this chapter the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  2008 regulation of ephedrine purchases legislative purpose a the city council finds that there is a current and immediate threat to the public health safety and welfare in

modifications because of climatic geological and topographical conditions within the city of chino the findings of need contained herein address each of these conditions and present the local situations which cause the established amendments to be adopted a the community experiences frequent low humidity summer temperatures exceeding one hundred degrees fahrenheit and severe santa ana winds reaching gusts of ninety miles per hour adverse climatic conditions increase the likelihood of fire minor fires can rapidly spread because of the climate and vegetation b the community periodically experiences drought and a resultant limited water supply the limited rainfall and storage capacities and continued consumption demands require sound management of water resources and conservation where possible there is a need for changes and modifications in the california building and california plumbing which will contribute to water conservation and water for suppression of large fires c the community is located in an area of continuing seismic activity existing and planned development is at risk from damage and fire because of this activity d the configuration and type of existing development require additional review wood construction including wood shingle and wood shake roofing presents extreme adverse fire conditions as does the close proximity of some buildings e there are a number of significant barriers and obstructions to quick emergency response these include increased vehicular traffic on surface streets  additional traffic signals  freeway expressways and storm drain channels which bisect the city  and the california institution for men existing older streets were in some cases designed as storm drains and become impassable during heavy rainfall f the community is located in an air quality nonattainment region research conducted by the south coast air quality management district and reflected in the 2003 clean air plan describes emissions and pollutants caused by incomplete combustion of wood burning devices such as fireplaces emissions and pollutants may be greatly reduced with the use of gasfired type fireplaces clean air vehicles such as cng compressed natural gas automobiles also reduce emissions and pollutants installation of a gas line within a private garage to provide for future cng vehicles will allow for these types of reductions g according to government statistics drowning is the number one cause of accidental death for children under the age of five in california arizona and florida nationally drowning is the second leading cause of accidental deaths to children under five years of age between 1990 and 199 there were five thousand eight hundred three children five years of age or under that were drowning

water capacity of 2000 gallons  2016   findings the city council hereby finds that the proposed amendments to the fire code are reasonable and necessary because of local climactic geologic and topographical conditions within the chino valley independent fire district district this finding is supported and based upon the following express findings which address each of these conditions and present the local situation which make the proposed amendments necessary 1 the climate weather patterns within the district include frequent periods of drought and low humidity adding to the fire danger fire season can be yearround in this region 2 during the summer months the dry winds and existing vegetation mix to create a hazardous fuel condition which has resulted in large loss vegetation and structure fires summer temperatures exceeding one hundred degrees 100 and severe santa ana winds frequently occur and can move a fire quickly throughout areas of the district multiple shifting wind patterns throughout the canyon areas add to the difficulty in suppressing fires 3 because of weather patterns the district has experienced a need for water conservation due to the storage capacities and consumption and a limited amount of rainfall drought conditions future water allocation is not fully dependable while sound management of the water resources is possible demands and possible critical depletions on an already stressed water supply can most assuredly be predicted 4 features located throughout the district are major roadways highways freeways and flood control channels which create barriers and slow response times other unique factors which create barriers and slow response times are the multiple canyons located within the district and the large california institute for men property 5 the topography is also very steep in large areas of the district affecting the rate of fire spread and response times 6 due to the sloping in the regional valley where the district is located as well as the present street and storm drain design heavy rainfall causes roadway flooding and landslides which at times may make an access route impassable 7 the district has within its boundaries active seismic hazards seismic activity within the district occurs yearly and a fire potential exists with these active faults existing structures and planned new development are at serious risk from an earthquake this risk includes fire collapse and the disruption of water supply for firefighting purposes areas can also become isolated as a result of bridge overpass and road damage and debris 8 structures in close proximity to each other pose an exposure problem which may cause a fire to spread from one structure to another as well as to the wildland area 9 for practical and cost reasons many new structures are built of wood construction many existing structures also have wood shake roofs the potential for a conflagration exists due to the design and density of current structures 10 electrical supply and telephone communication failures occur due to high winds as well as others reasons water supply pumps and early notification cannot always be counted on 11 narrow and winding streets with little circulation and streets designed as storm drains impede emergency vehicle access and evacuation routes  2016 california existing building code footnotes  11

between background and letterssymbols use significant contrast between the signs lettersymbol color and its background color if there is little contrast in the hue shade or tint and intensity brightness between the background and lettersymbol colors it will be difficult to read 6 avoid too many different colors the use of too many different colors will overwhelm the basic function of

proportion of the lower storefront b signs can be used to establish facade rhythm scale and proportion where such elements are weak in the building design on buildings having a monolithic or plain facade signs can be used to establish or continue appropriate design rhythm proportion and scale c the proportion of letter area to sign background area should be carefully considered if the letters take up too much of the background area they may be harder to readlarge letters are not necessarily more legible than smaller ones generally letters should not appear to occupy more than seventy percent of the signs background area 9 pedestrian signs signs oriented to pedestrians should be smaller in scale the pedestrianoriented sign is usually read from a distance of fifteen to twenty feet

international is pleased to provide the following building valuation data bvd for its members the bvd will be updated at sixmonth intervals with the next update in february 2018 icc strongly recommends that all jurisdictions and other interested parties actively evaluate and assess the impact of this bvd table before utilizing it in their current code enforcement related activities the bvd table provides the average construction costs per square foot which can be used in determining permit fees for a jurisdiction permit fee schedules are addressed in of the 2015 international building ibc whereas addresses building permit valuations the permit fees can be established by using the bvd table and a permit fee multiplier which is based on the total construction value within the jurisdiction for the past year the square foot construction cost table presents factors that reflect relative value of one construction classificationoccupancy group to another so that more expensive construction is assessed greater permit fees than less expensive construction icc has developed this data to aid jurisdictions in determining permit fees it is important to note that while this bvd table does determine an estimated value of a building ie gross area x square foot construction cost this data is only intended to assist jurisdictions in determining their permit fees this data table is not intended to be used as an estimating guide because the data only reflects average costs and is not representative of specific construction this degree of precision is sufficient for the intended purpose which is to help establish permit fees so as to fund code compliance activities this bvd table provides jurisdictions with a simplified way to determine the estimated value of a building that does not rely on the permit applicant to determine the cost of construction therefore the bidding process for a particular job and other associated factors do not affect the value of a building for determining the permit fee whether a specific project is bid at a cost above or below the computed value of construction does not affect the permit fee because the cost of related code enforcement activities is not directly affected by the bid process and results building valuation the following building valuation data represents average valuations for most buildings in conjunction with ibc this data is offered as an aid for the building official to determine if the permit valuation is underestimated again it should be noted that when using this data these are average costs based on typical construction methods for each occupancy group and type of construction the average costs include foundation work structural and nonstructural building components electrical plumbing mechanical and interior finish material the data is a national average and does not take into account any regional cost differences as such the use of regional cost modifiers is subject to the authority having jurisdiction permit fee multiplier determine the permit fee multiplier 1 based on historical records determine the total annual construction value which has occurred within the jurisdiction for the past year 2 determine the percentage % of the building department budget expected to be provided by building permit revenue 3 example  b0 the building department operates on a $300000 budget and it expects to cover 75 percent of that from building permit fees the total annual construction value which occurred within the jurisdiction in the previous year is $30000000 permit fee the permit fee is determined using the building gross area the square foot construction cost and the permit fee multiplier permit fee   gross area x square foot construction cost x permit fee multiplier example type of construction iib area 1st story   8000 sq feet  2nd story   8000 sq feet  height 2 stories permit fee multiplier    use group b 1 gross area business   2 stories x 8000 sq feet    16000 sq feet  2 square foot construction cost biib   $16519sq feet  3 permit fee business   16000 sq feet  x $16519sq feet  x    $1982300 important points  the bvd is not intended to apply to alterations or repairs to existing buildings because the scope of alterations or repairs to an existing building varies so greatly the square foot construction costs table does not reflect accurate values for that purpose however the square foot construction costs table can be used to determine the cost of an addition that is basically a standalone building which happens to be attached to an existing building in the case of such additions the only alterations to the existing building would involve the attachment of the addition to the existing building and the openings between the addition and the existing building  for purposes of establishing the permit fee multiplier the estimated total annual construction value for a given time period 1 year is the sum of each buildings value gross area x square foot construction cost for that time period eg 1 year  the square foot construction cost does not include the price of the land on which the building is built the square foot construction cost takes into account everything from foundation work to the roof structure and coverings but does not include the price of the land the cost of the land does not affect the cost of related code enforcement activities and is not included in the square foot construction cost square foot construction costs a b c d group 2015 international building  ia ib iia iib iiia iiib iv va vb
