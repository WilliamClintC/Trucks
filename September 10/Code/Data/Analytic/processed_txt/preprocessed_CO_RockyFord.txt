for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the health safety and general welfare of the public b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage    292016 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and

against flood damage at the time of initial construction 3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
