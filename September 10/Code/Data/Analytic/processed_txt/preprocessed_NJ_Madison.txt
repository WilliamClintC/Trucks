6f of this section when it can be demonstrated that the information requested is impossible to obtain or it would create a hardship on the applicant to obtain and its absence will not materially affect the review process a intent and purpose the governing body of the borough of madison finds that riparian lands adjacent to streams lakes or other surface water bodies that are adequately vegetated provide an important environmental protection and water resource management benefit it is necessary to protect and maintain the beneficial character of riparian areas by implementing specifications for the establishment protection and maintenance of vegetation along the surface water bodies within the jurisdiction of the borough consistent with the interest of landowners in making reasonable economic use of parcels of land that include such designated areas the purpose of this section is to designate riparian zones and to provide for land use regulation therein in order to protect the streams lakes and other surface water bodies of the borough of madison  to protect the water quality of watercourses reservoirs lakes and other significant water resources within the borough of madison  to protect the riparian and aquatic ecosystems of madison  to provide for the environmentally sound use of the land resources of the borough and to complement existing state regional county and municipal stream corridor protection and management regulations and initiatives the specific purposes and intent of this section are to  195379 madison code  1953710  1 restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the water resources of the borough of madison  2 prevent excessive nutrients sediment and organic matter as well as biocides and other pollutants from reaching surface waters by optimizing opportunities for filtration deposition absorption adsorption plant uptake biodegradation and denitrification which occur when stormwater runoff is conveyed buffers as stable distributed sheet flow prior to reaching receiving waters  3 provide for shading of the aquatic environment so as to moderate temperatures retain more dissolved oxygen and support a healthy assemblage of aquatic flora and fauna  4 provide for the availability of natural organic matter fallen leaves and twigs and large woody debris fallen trees and limbs that provide food and habitat for small bottomdwelling organisms insects amphibians crustaceans and small fish which are essential to maintain the food chain  5 increase stream bank stability and maintain natural fluvial geomorphology of the stream system thereby reducing stream bank erosion and sedimentation and protecting habitat for aquatic organisms  6 maintain base flows in streams and moisture in wetlands  7 control downstream flooding  and 8 conserve the natural features important to land and water resources eg headwater areas groundwater recharge zones floodways floodplains springs streams wetlands woodlands and prime wildlife habitats b statutory authority the municipality of the borough of madison is empowered to regulate land uses under the provisions of the new jersey municipal land
