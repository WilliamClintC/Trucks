cottage housing project to show some of the major features  legislative findings the common council makes the following legislative findings 1 cottage housing is a new type of housing in wisconsin rapids that can fill an unmet housing need 2 cottage housing can provide opportunities for homeownership that may not otherwise exist 3 cottage housing responds to demographic trends occurring locally in the region and nationally these include a declining household size and more people living alone and longer 4 it is not possible to define specific areas in the city where cottage housing should be developed rather cottage housing is a development option that developers can explore 5 cottage housing will likely have the same or fewer people than the singlefamily homes that could be built on the site 6 given the size restrictions on the housing unit the bulk of a cottage housing project is similar to the singlefamily homes that could be built on the site 7 cottage housing is consistent with the citys comprehensive plan and supports the findings in the housing study completed in 2016 8 rather than codifying all parameters of cottage development the standards in this article are intended to provide sufficient guidance without becoming overly prescriptive with the understanding that the city and the developer will work together to craft a detailed development plan that meets community

identification of required bufferyard standard the required bufferyard standard is determined using exhibit 167 first determine which of the two zoning districts allows the most intense development next find that zoning designation at the top of the table and then move down the column to the cell where the zoning designation of the other district intersects if a bufferyard is required a letter will be shown in that cell if the parcel being developed adjoins land in the town that municipalitys zoning classification that most closely corresponds to the citys zoning classification is used to determine bufferyard requirements step two  identification of detailed bufferyard requirements in the next step the developer chooses how the required standard will be met for each standard a variety
