operations of radiodispatched tow truck services that on a contract basis make periodic patrols of the parking facilities of large apartment and multifamily residential complexes to locate and tow away or impound illegally or improperly parked motor vehicles while providing a useful service to the property owners or lessees in question andor their apartment managers have resulted in numerous complaints to the city from residents concerning the methods employed and the substantial fees charged and have led to an inordinate number of public disturbances and serious altercations requiring the response of city police officers bmany of the citizen complaints received by the city council at the several public hearings held concerning this matter have indicated that many of the problems

vehicle drivers who may park in improper places  2the lack of personal involvement from the apartment owners or managers in connection with the vehicle impoundment so as to preclude any input concerning pertinent facts or variable situations which might affect the impound process  3the apparent swiftness of the entire impoundment procedure which often results in the towing of vehicles parked improperly for only very brief periods  and 4effective process to dispute the towing of a vehicle but only the remedy of an immediate large cash payment to retrieve ones vehicle to avoid an

purpose athe purpose of this chapter is to promote public safety and welfare by reducing the risk of death or injury that may result from the effects of earthquakes on unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings such buildings have been widely recognized for sustaining lifehazardous damage including partial or complete collapse during moderate to strong earthquakes bthe provisions of this chapter are intended as minimum standards for structural seismic resistance established primarily to reduce the risk of life loss or injury compliance with these standards will not necessarily prevent loss of life or injury or prevent earthquake damage to rehabilitated buildings this chapter does not require analysis or alteration of existing electrical plumbing mechanical or fire safety systems unless they constitute a hazard to life or property cthis chapter provides systematic procedures and standards for identification and classification of unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings based on their present use priorities time periods and standards are also established under which these buildings are required to be structurally analyzed exh a 1990  scope of chapter the provisions

evaluated on an individual basis without prejudice or comparison to similar type or age buildings which may have greater or lesser earthquake resistance generalities or stereotypes are to be avoided in the evaluation process by focusing on the specifics of the structural systems of the building in question and the local geology of the land on which the building is constructed blevel of investigation some buildings will require extensive testing and field investigation to uncover potential structural deficiencies while others will allow the same level of overall evaluation by a less complicated process due to simplicity of design or the availability of original or subsequent alteration design and construction documents it is the responsibility of the engineer performing the evaluation to choose the appropriate level of investigation which will produce a report that is complete and can serve as a sound basis for a conclusion on the collapse hazard the building may present cformat for the report the following is a basic outline of the format each engineering report should follow this outline is not to be construed as a constraint on the professional preparing the report

alternatives in determining whether the purposes of this chapter would be better served under the proposed alternative the review authority should consider 1whether implementation of an alternative would overly concentrate inclusionary units within any specific area and if so must reject the alternative unless the undesirable concentration of inclusionary units is offset by other identified benefits that flow from implementation of the alternative in issue  and 2the extent to which other factors affect the feasibility of prompt construction of the inclusionary units on the property such
