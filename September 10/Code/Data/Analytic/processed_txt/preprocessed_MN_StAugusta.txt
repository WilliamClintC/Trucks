peace officers may issue cease and desist orders and restoration and replacement orders b cease and desist orders sitespecific cease and desist orders may be issued when the enforcement authority has probable cause that a drain or fill activity is being or has been conducted in a wetland and does not qualify for an exemption or a noloss determination and is being or has been conducted without prior approval of a replacement plan by the city of st augusta a cease and desist order will not be issued if the landowner has a valid certificate of exemption or noloss from the city of st augusta or has evidence to support an exemption otherwise 1 the enforcement authority may issue a cease and desist order upon discovery of the drain or fill activity  2 the order may be withheld to give the landowner time to produce the evidence required by the city of st augusta to the enforcement authority of qualification for an exemption or noloss determination  or 3 a cease and desist order may be issued with an effective date three weeks from the date of issuance the enforcement authority may exercise this option when the enforcement authority cannot readily make a determination on the facts and circumstances to deny a landowners claim of exemption or noloss and continued drain or fill activity would not cause irreparable harm to the wetland  the enforcement authority will advise the landowner that the landowners application if any for an exemption or noloss determination should be made immediately to the city of st augusta and that whatever drain and fill work the landowner has done may require restoration according to a restoration plan designed by the soil and  water conservation district if the application for exemption or noloss determination is denied the enforcement authority issuing a cease and desist order will submit copies to the soil and water conservation district city of st augusta  and department  if an application for an exemption or noloss determination is triggered by a cease and desist order the city of st augusta or the technical evaluation panel will make a decision within three weeks from the date of application the city of st augusta or the technical evaluation panel will review evidence of exemption or noloss produced by the landowner inspect the site if necessary and determine 1 if the area in question is a wetland  and 2 if the activity qualifies for an exemption or noloss determination in cases where the cease and desist order has been issued to the city of st augusta the determination of exemption or noloss will be made by the board of soil and water resources if the decision is that the activity is exempt or results in a noloss determination the decision maker will issue a certificate of exemption or noloss request

shall immediately notify the soil and water conservation district the department the enforcement authority and the landowner c restoration and replacement orders the enforcement authority will issue a restoration order or replacement order when the drain or fill has already been completed when discovered or after a cease and deist order has been issued and the landowner does not seek an exemption or noloss determination within three weeks or the city of st augusta denies the application promptly upon being informed by the enforcement authority of the need the soil and water conservation district staff person shall inspect the site and prepare a plan in consultation with the city of st augusta for restoring the site to its prealtered condition unless the soil and water conservation district person concludes that restoration is impossible the soil and water conservation district shall incorporate its plan into a restoration or replacement order and send it to the enforcement authority for service in person or by certified mail to the landowner the restoration order will specify a date by which the andowner must either 1 restore the wetland according to the soil and water conservation district plan and obtain a certificate of satisfactory restoration from the soil and water conservation district  or  2 submit a replacement plan to the city of st augusta the order will state that it will be canceled when the landowner obtains a certificate of exemption or noloss from the city of st augusta or a certificate that restoration has been completed according to an approved restoration plan otherwise  the landowner must restore the wetland in the manner required by the restoration order  if the soil and water conservation district determines that restoration will not restore all the loss caused by the drain or fill activity the enforcement authority may order a combination of restoration and replacement or may order replacement rather than restoration as determined by the soil and water conservation district the order will direct the landowner to obtain replacement plan approval from the city of st augusta the order must specify that if replacement plan approval is not obtained the l ndowner must restore the wetland in a manner determined by the soil and water conservation district each cease and desist restoration and replacement order will tell the landowner that violation of the order is a misdemeanor  if as part of a misdemeanor proceeding the court orders restoration or replacement the soil and water conservation district will determine which is appropriate and if it is restoration the method of restoration if the court orders replacement the landowner must follow the replacement plan process in this the court orders

avoidance  a avoidance will be required when indicated by special considerations as stated in this wetland dependence determination i based on information provided by the applicant the city of st

will consider the following in evaluating alternatives as applicable a whether the basic project purpose can be reasonably accomplished using one or more other sites in the same general area that would avoid wetland impacts an alternate site will not be excluded from consideration only because it includes or requires an area not owned by the applicant that could reasonably be obtained  used expanded or managed to fulfill the basic purpose of the proposed project  b the general suitability of alternate sites considered by the applicant  c whether reasonable modification of the size scope configuration or density of the project would avoid impacts to wetlands  d efforts by the applicant to accommodate or remove constraints on alternatives imposed by zoning standards or infrastructure including request for conditional use permits variances or planned unit developments  and e the physical economic and demographic requirements of the project economic considerations alone do not make an alternative not feasible and prudent iii if the city of st augusta determines that a feasible and prudent alternative exists that would avoid impacts to wetlands it will deny the replacement plan
