1 land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds increasing stormwater runoff rates velocities volumes and pollutant loads and increase flooding channel erosion and pollutant transport and deposition in rivers and streams  2 land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds increasing stormwater runoff rates velocities volumes and pollutant loads and consequently alter water levels and fluctuations and increase pollutant transport and deposition in wetlands  3 land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds increasing stormwater runoff rates velocities volumes and pollutant loads and alter salinity concentrations and fluctuations and increase productivity and pollutant transport and deposition in estuaries  4 land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds increasing stormwater runoff rates velocities volumes and pollutant loads and increase bacteria transport and deposition in near coastal waters which leads to beach contamination and closure and poses a serious threat to human health  5 land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds increasing stormwater runoff rates and volumes and consequently decreasing the amount of rainfall that is available to recharge shallow groundwater aquifers  6 the negative impacts of land development activities on these important local aquatic resources can adversely affect the health safety and general welfare of the public  7 the negative impacts of land development can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff rates velocities volumes and pollutant loads on development and redevelopment sites  8 communities within the coastal nonpoint source management area are required to comply with specific state and federal regulations that require the adverse impacts of increased stormwater runoff rates volumes and pollutant loads to be controlled and minimized therefore the city of port wentworth has determined that it is in the public interest to control and minimize the adverse impacts of land development activities and has established this set of stormwater management provisions to regulate postconstruction stormwater runoff rates velocities volumes and pollutant loads on development and redevelopment sites b purpose and intent the purpose of this article is to protect and maintain the integrity of local aquatic resources and consequently the health safety and welfare of the general public by establishing minimum stormwater management provisions that control and minimize the adverse impacts of land development activities this article seeks to meet that purpose following objectives 1 establish decisionmaking processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of local aquatic resources  2 establish minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria that will reduce flooding channel erosion and pollutant transport and deposition in local aquatic resources  3 establish minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria that will help preserve existing hydrologic conditions and development and redevelopment sites  4 establish design criteria for structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices that can be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria  5 encourage the use of better site planning better site design and low impact development practices such as those found in the georgia stormwater management manual gsmm and the coastal stormwater supplement css to the maximum extent practical at development and redevelopment sites to mimic the predevelopment hydrologic function of the site by encouraging natural processes that detain and filter stormwater runoff pollutants  6 establish provisions for the longterm upkeep and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed and pose a minimal threat to public safety  7 establish administrative procedures for the submission review approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved land development projects  8 identify and protect existing natural systems from potential adverse impacts resulting from land development activities and post construction stormwater runoff  and 9 balance development demands and natural resource protection implementation of low impact planning design and development strategies c applicability this article shall be applicable to all land development activities including but not limited to site plan applications subdivision applications and grading applications unless exempt pursuant to subsection d below these standards apply to any new development or redevelopment activity within city of port wentworth that meets one 1 or more of the following criteria 1 new development that involves the creation of five thousand 5000 square feet or more of impervious cover or that involves other land development activities of one 1 acre or more

occurred over the past ten years the current heart of port wentworth is being impacted by activities of the neighboring georgia ports authority related private sector industries and other impacts that are unsuitable for a residential area these activities have resulted in acquisition of private homes and increased truck traffic on south coastal highway which was once the citys commercial center the city of port wentworth offers little to new businesses other than industrial uses or residents in the proximity of the core city for this reason the city is looking at the areas addressed overlay district as the focus of future development for port wentworth these areas are largely undeveloped with the exception of small pockets of residential development current expansion of water and sewer infrastructure will help foster development in this area 22 guiding principles in order to foster growth that will lead to the type of community desired by the citizens of port wentworth the city is preparing a master plan for development this master plan is being developed based on the principles of traditional neighborhood development tnd over the past several decades traditional zoning has promoted segregated land uses excessive minimum lot sizes and disconnected street patterns these characteristics have largely contributed to traffic congestion excessive reliance on automobile ownership social inequity and inefficient land use through the use of tnd principles the master plan will result in a community of connected neighborhoods with a distinct town center rather than a series of isolated subdivisions and strip shopping centers certain areas will encourage residential units above retail shops while other areas will allow a neighborhood store in close proximity to singlefamily housing neighborhoods will be connected grid street pattern and a multipurpose trail system 23 application procedure projects in the master plan design districts that require subdivision must first prepare a master plan to be reviewed by the city all master plans require review and approval by the port wentworth planning commission and city council the port wentworth planning commission has primary responsibility for review of proposed projects in the master plan design districts it is strongly recommended that the property owners or developers submit the master plan of the proposed project to the port wentworth planning commission for informal staff review prior to their submittal of the final master plan and application staff is available to meet with property owners or developers conceptual designs may take the form of dimensioned sketches or may be more refined however the graphics should enable staff to determine if there are obvious conflicts with

landing and take off facilities and is of a greater height than the nearest point on the runway center line approach zones an area longitudinal centered on the extended runway center line and extending outward from each end of the primary zone an approach zone is designed for each runway based upon the type of approach available or planned for that runway end a precision instrument approach zone an instrument approach zone is established at each end of precision instrument runways the inner edge of the precision instrument approach zone shall have a width of one thousand 1000 feet at a distance of two hundred 200 feet beyond each end of the runway the inner edge shall then widen uniformly to a width of sixteen thousand 16000 feet at a distance of fifty thousand two hundred 50200 feet beyond each end of the runway b nonprecision instrument approach zones nonprecision instrument approach zones are established at each end of the nonprecision runways the inner edge of the nonprecision instrument approach zone shall have a width of one thousand 1000 feet at a distance of two hundred 200 feet beyond each end of the runway the inner edge shall then widen uniformly to a width of four thousand 4000 feet for that end of a nonprecision instrument runway having a nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low as threefourths statute mile this type of approach zone extends to a horizontal distance of ten thousand two hundred 10200 feet beyond each end of the runway transitional zones transitional zones are established adjacent to each precision and nonprecision instrument runway they extend outward from the sides of the primary and approach zones and connect to the horizontal and conical zones transitional zones are further established adjacent to the precision instrument approach zone which projects beyond the limits of the conical zone extending a distance of five thousand 5000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the precision instrument approach zone perpendicular to the extended center line of the runway horizontal zone a a horizontal zone is the area within the perimeter of a horizontal plane that is constructed by swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway of each airport and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs the radius of each arc is ten thousand 10000 feet for all runways at the airport b the radius of the arc specified for each end of a runway will have the same arithmetical value that value will be the highest composite value determined for either end of the runway when a five thousandfoot arc is encompassed by tangents connecting two 2 adjacent ten thousandfoot arcs the five thousandfoot arc shall be disregarded on the construction of the perimeter of the horizontal plane the horizontal zone does not include the precision and nonprecision approach zones and the transition zones conical zone a conical zone is established as the area that begins at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of four thousand 4000 feet the conical zone does not include the approach zones and transition zones article vii  height limit limitation on structures and trees except as otherwise provided in this ordinance no structure or tree shall be erected altered allowed to grow or maintained in any zone to a height in excess of the height limit herein established for such zone if any structure or tree is erected altered allowed to grow or maintained in an area located in more than one 1 zone then that structure or tree will be considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation the various zones are hereby established and defined as follows precision instrument approach zone one foot in height for each fifty 50 feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point two hundred 200 feet from and at the center line elevation of the end of the instrument runway and extending to a distance of ten thousand two hundred 10200 feet from the end of the runway  thence one 1 foot in height for each forty 40 feet in horizontal distance to a point fifty thousand two hundred 50200 feet from the end of the runway nonprecision instrument approach zone one foot vertically for each thirtyfour 34 feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point two hundred 200 feet from and at the center line elevation of the nonprecision instrument runway and extending to a point ten thousand two hundred 10200 feet from the end of the runway transitional zone this area extending outward from the sides of the primary zone and approach zones connecting them to the horizontal and conical zones height limits within the transitional zone are the same as the primary zone or approach zone at the boundary line where it adjoins and increases at a rate of one 1 foot vertically for every seven 7 feet horizontally with the horizontal distance measured at right angles to the runway center line and extended center line until the height matches the height of the horizontal zone or conical zone or for a horizontal distance of five thousand 5000 feet from the side of the part of the precision approach zone that extends beyond the conical zone horizontal zone one hundred fifty 150 feet above established airport elevation conical zone the area extending outward from the periphery of the horizontal zone for a distance of four thousand 4000 feet height limitations for structures in the conical zone are one hundred fifty 150 feet above the airport height at the inner boundary with permitted height increasing one 1 foot vertically every twenty 20 feet to a height of three hundred fifty 350 feet above the airport elevation article viii  nonconforming obstructions the regulations prescribed by this ordinance shall not be construed to require the removal lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations when adopted or amended or to otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction or alteration of any structure the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the adoption of or to any amendments to this ordinance and is diligently prosecuted and completed within six 6 months thereof article ix  permits permit required for nonconforming structures no nonconforming structures or trees may be erected replaced substantially altered or repaired rebuilt allowed to grow higher or replanted in any zone created in this ordinance unless a permit is secured from the zoning administrator authorizing such replacement change or repair except as follows a no permit shall be required for any structure less than seventyfive 75 feet of vertical height above the ground except when because of terrain land contour or topographic features such structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for the following areas 1 within the entire limits of the horizontal conical or transitional zones 2 within the limits of the precision instrument approach zones application indicating purpose each application shall indicate the purpose for which it is desired with sufficient particularity to determine whether the resulting use or structure would conform to the regulations prescribed in this ordinance if such determination is in the affirmative the permit applied for shall be granted permit restrictions no permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use structure or tree to be made or become higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this ordinance or than it is when the application for a permit is made abandonment destroyed or decayed structure whenever the zoning administrator determines that a nonconforming use or nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or is more than seventy 70 per cent torn down destroyed deteriorated or decayed no permit shall be granted that would allow said structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limits or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations article x  hazard marking and lighting required any permit granted under of this ordinance may if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purposes of this ordinance and reasonable in the circumstances be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the airport commission at its own expense to install operate and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard article xi  removal of nonconforming structures the airport commission may negotiate with owners of nonconforming structures for removal lighting or marking of existing nonconforming structures to be installed operated and maintained at the commissions expense article xii  variances prohibited no variances special exceptions or any other appeal within any zone created by this ordinance shall be considered or granted which would violate any restrictions imposed by this ordinance article xiii  administrative agency the zoning administrator is hereby designated the administrative agency charged with the duty of administering and enforcing the regulations prescribed by this ordinance the duties of the zoning administrator shall include that of hearing and deciding all applications for permits article xiv  penalties any person convicted of violating any provision of this ordinance shall be subject to a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars $10000 or imprisonment not to exceed thirty 30 days or both and
