findings the city finds that 1 water bodies roadways structures and other property within and downstream of the city are at times subjected to flooding  2 flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is also a danger to the natural resources of the city and the region  3 land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes increased flooding increased stream channel erosion and increased sediment transport and deposition  4 stormwater runoff produced by land development contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants  5 increases of stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution have occurred as a result of land development and cause deterioration of the water resources of the city and downstream municipalities  6 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution due to land development within the city have resulted in a deterioration of the water resources of the city and downstream municipalities  7 increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes and the sediments and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects within the city will absent reasonable regulation and control adversely affect the citys water bodies and water resources and those of downstream municipalities  8 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation of stormwater runoff from development  9 adopting the standards criteria and procedures contained herein and implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects of stormwater runoff  10 adopting these standards is necessary for the preservation of the public health safety and welfare  11 illicit discharges contain pollutants that will significantly degrade the citys water bodies and water resources  12 illicit discharges enter the municipal separate storm sewer system direct connections eg wastewater piping either mistakenly or deliberately connected to the storm drains or indirect connections eg infiltration into the storm drain system or spills connected by drain inlets  and 13 establishing the measures for controlling illicit discharges and connections contained herein and implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects of illicit discharges  121404 purpose it is the purpose of this article to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to accomplish among others the following objectives 1 to reduce artificially induced flood damage  2 to minimize increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes from identified new land development  3 to minimize the deterioration of existing watercourses culverts and bridges and other structures  4 to encourage water recharge into the ground where geologically favorable conditions exist  5 to prevent an increase in nonpoint source pollution  6 to maintain the integrity of stream channels for their biological functions as well as for drainage and other purposes  7 to minimize the impact of development upon stream bank and stream bed stability  8 to reduce erosion from development or construction projects  9 to preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resources by means of controlling increased flood discharges stream erosion and runoff pollution  10 to reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution wherever practicable from lands that were developed without stormwater management controls meeting the purposes and standards of this article  11 to reduce the adverse impact of changing land use on water bodies and to that end establish minimum standards to protect water bodies from degradation resulting from changing land use where there are insufficient stormwater management controls  12 to regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system by stormwater discharges by any user  13 to prohibit illicit discharges and connection to the municipal separate storm sewer system  and 14 to establish legal authority to carry out all inspection surveillance monitoring and

species a recommended tree and plant species as identified in section 81 one of the intentions of this article is the maintenance of a regionalnativelandscape character this is important because of the unique natural landscape quality that is found in the hudsonville area a landscape composition that occurs no where else in the region or even the midwest the importance stems from preserving a declining supply of native plants which so many animals birds and insects depend upon for their survival these species have adapted with a symbiotic relationship that goes back several thousand years in many cases exotic nonnative species do not provide the proper opportunities for food shelter and nesting if native vegetation is lost the preservation of hudsonvilles fauna is put at risk for the above reasons the following list of plant species is recommended for use in required landscape plantings 1 canopy trees common name horticultural name sugar maple acer saccharum beech fagus

commission shall not be obligated to make any waiver of landscaping requirements article 9  driveway standards purpose a driveways much like intersecting streets create points of conflict with thus driveways can interfere with the intended function of the roadway to move traffic safely and efficiently the potential impacts generated by driveway traffic are dependent on a number of factors including the number of vehicles using the driveway driveway placement and design the number of lanes in the roadway and the traffic volumes on the roadway a driveway serving a large commercial center can be viewed much like a major intersecting street while a singlefamily residential driveway has a much less detrimental effect to reduce the negative impacts created by driveway operations the standards outlined in this ordinance are intended to 1 identify driveway design criteria that promote safe and efficient ingress and egress at driveways  2 reduce the number of driveways increase the spacing between driveways and between driveways and intersections and reduce the number of poorly aligned driveways  3 reduce the frequency of conflicts or the area of conflict at some or all driveways by limiting or preventing certain maneuvers  4 reduce both the frequency and severity of conflicts by providing separate paths and storage areas for turning vehicles and queues  5 acknowledge that substantial public funds have been invested to develop a network to move traffic safely and efficiently  and 6 recognize that property owners have an inherent right to access public

driver must process and react to locating a driveway away from the operational area of a signalized intersection decreases the potential for congestion and accidents for both vehicles using the driveway adequate spacing between driveways and unsignalized roadways or other driveways can reduce confusion inadequate spacing requires drivers to watch for ingress and egress traffic at several points while simultaneously trying to control their vehicle and monitor other traffic ahead of and behind them b commercial driveways 1 driveways shall be located so as to limit undue interference with the free movement of road traffic to provide the required sight distance and to provide the most favorable driveway grade 2 driveways including the radii but not including rightturn lanes passing

classification see figure 91 and intersection control the spacing measurements in table 91 and table 92 are from the center line of the proposed driveway to the near rightofway line of the intersecting street 5 in those cases where an intersection setback for a driveway cannot be met the planning commission may require that the drive be constructed on an alternative street or be provided shared driveway which meets the applicable intersection setback where no other alternatives exist the planning commission may allow construction of the drive along the lot line farthest from the intersection 6 driveway spacing requirements distance between two driveways shall be determined based upon posted speed limits the driveway spacing indicated in table 93 are measured from center line to center line the planning commission may reduce the spacing distance requirements in table 93 but in no case will the spacing be less than 80% of those figures 7 for lots or parcels existing prior to the adoption of this ordinance one driveway may be permitted for each separately owned parcel with less than 100 feet of frontage provided that the parcel is wide enough for the minimum
