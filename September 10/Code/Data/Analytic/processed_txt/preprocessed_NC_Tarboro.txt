those they represent d council members must always remain aware that at various times they play different roles 1 as advocates who strive to advance the legitimate needs of their citizens  2 as legislators who balance the public interest and private rights in considering and enacting decisions ordinances and resolutions  and 3 as decisionmakers who arrive at fair and impartial quasijudicial and administrative determinations e council members must know how to distinguish among these roles to determine when each role is appropriate and to act accordingly f council members must be aware of their obligation to conform their behavior to standards of ethical conduct that warrant the trust of their constituents each official must find within his or her own conscience the touchstone by which to determine what conduct is appropriate obey the law council members should obey all laws applicable to their official actions as members of the council council members should be guided by the spirit as well as the letter of the law in whatever they do act with civility council members should feel free to assert policy positions and opinions without fear of reprisal from fellow council members or citizens to declare that a council member is behaving unethically because one disagrees with that council member on a question of policy and not because of the council members behavior is unfair

treating other council members and the public with respect and honoring the opinions of others even when the council members disagree with those opinions  j not reaching conclusions on issues until all sides have been heard  k showing respect for their office and not behaving in ways that reflect badly on those in office  l recognizing that they are part of a larger group and acting accordingly  and m recognizing that individual council members are not generally allowed to act on behalf of the council but may only do so if the council specifically authorizes it and that the council must take official action as a body avoid impropriety a council members should avoid impropriety in the exercise of their official duties their official actions should be above reproach although opinions may vary about what behavior is inappropriate this council will consider impropriety in terms of whether a reasonable person who is aware of all of the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the council members action would conclude that the action was inappropriate b if a council member believes that his or her actions while legal and ethical may be misunderstood the member should seek the advice of the towns attorney and should consider publicly disclosing the facts of the situation and the steps taken to resolve it such as consulting with the attorney faithfully perform the duties of office council members should faithfully perform the duties of their office they should act as especially responsible citizens whom others can trust and respect they should set a good example for

amendment rather than this chapter appendix as originally adopted creates a nonconforming situation 3 expenditure a sum of money paid out in return for some benefit or to fulfill some obligation the term also includes binding contractual commitments to make future expenditures as well as any other substantial changes in position 4 nonconforming lot a lot existing at the effective date of this chapter appendix and not created for the purposes of evading the restrictions of this chapter appendix that does not meet the minimum area requirement of the district in which the lot is located 5 nonconforming project any structure development or undertaking that is incomplete at the effective date of this chapter appendix and would be inconsistent with any regulation applicable to the district in which it is located if completed as proposed or planned 6 nonconforming sign a sign see for definition that on the effective date of this chapter appendix does not conform to one 1 or more of the regulations set forth in this chapter appendix particularly signs 7 nonconforming use a nonconforming situation that occurs when property is used for a purpose or in a manner made unlawful by the use regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located for example a commercial office building in a residential district may be a nonconforming use the term also refers to the activity that constitutes the use made of the property for example all the activity associated with running a bakery in a residentially zoned area is a nonconforming use 8 nonconforming situation a situation that occurs when on the effective date of this chapter appendix an existing lot or structure or use of an existing lot or structure does not conform to one 1 or more of the regulations applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is located among other possibilities a nonconforming situation may arise because a lot does not meet minimum acreage requirements because structures exceed maximum height limitations because the relationship between existing buildings and the land in such matters as density and setback requirements is not in conformity with this chapter appendix because signs do not meet the requirements of of this chapter appendix or because land or buildings are used for purposes made unlawful by this chapter appendix continuation of nonconforming situations and completion of nonconforming projects a unless otherwise specifically provided in this chapter appendix eg nonconforming signs and subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this chapter appendix may be continued b nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of nonconforming a when a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use except that the lot is smaller than the required minimums set forth in then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming however no use eg a twofamily residence that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a particular zone is permissible on a nonconforming lot b when the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects but the applicable setback requirements  cannot reasonably be complied with then the entity authorized by this chapter appendix to issue a permit for the proposed use the administrator planning board or council may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that 1 the property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such deviations  2 these deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot  and 3 the property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety c for purposes of b compliance with applicable building setback requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with such setback requirements however mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible d this section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots a lot is undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it a change in use of a developed nonconforming lot may be accomplished in accordance with e subject to the following sentence if on the date this section becomes effective an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one 1 or more other undeveloped lots under the same ownership then neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor his successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section this subsection shall not apply to a nonconforming lot if fifty 50 percent or more of the developed lots located on either side of the street where such lot is located and within five hundred 500 feet of such lot are also nonconforming the intent of this subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to create conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein but not to require such combination when that would be out of character with the way the neighborhood has previously been developed  51004 extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations a except as specifically provided in this section no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation in particular physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in 1 an increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use  or 2 greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as parking requirements b subject to d a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that when the use was made nonconforming by this chapter appendix was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use however subject to authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building c subject to authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming except that a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the lot eg a sand pit may be expanded to the boundaries of the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming if ten 10 percent or more of the earth products had already been removed on the effective date of this chapter appendix d the volume intensity or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other paragraphs of this section occur e notwithstanding a any structure used for singlefamily residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to such matters as setback and parking requirements this paragraph is subject to the limitations stated in abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations f notwithstanding a whenever there exists a lot with one 1 or more structures on it  and a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot  and the parking or loading requirements of that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading then the proposed use shall not be regarded as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming situation however the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable parking and loading requirements that can be satisfied without acquiring additional land and shall also be required to obtain satellite parking in accordance with if parking requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot with respect to which the permit is required and such satellite parking is reasonably available if such satellite parking is not reasonably available at the time the zoning or special or conditional use permit is granted then the permit recipient shall be required to obtain it if and when it does become reasonably available this requirement shall be a continuing condition of the permit repair maintenance and reconstruction a minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged major renovation ie work estimated to cost more than sixty 60 percent of the appraised valuation of the structure to be renovated may be done only in accordance with a special use permit issued pursuant to this section b if a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair or replacement would exceed twentyfive 25 percent of the appraised valuation of the damaged structure then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in accordance with a special use permit issued pursuant to this section this subsection does not apply to structures used for singlefamily residential purposes which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a zoning permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in e c for purposes of subsections a and b 1 the cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the fair market value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation repair or replacement 2 the cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such intended work and no person may seek to avoid the intent of subsections a or b by doing such work incrementally 3 the appraised valuation shall mean either the appraised valuation for property tax purposes updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since the date of the last valuation or the valuation determined by a professionally recognized property appraiser d the planning board shall issue a special use permit authorized by this section if it finds that in completing the renovation repair or replacement work 1 there is no increase in the total amount of lot area devoted to the nonconforming use  2 there is no greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as parking loading and landscaping requirements  and 3 there is no significant adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety in issuing a special use permit the board may affix other reasonable and appropriate conditions such as but not limited to landscaping and buffering to separate dissimilar uses or to screen parking and loading areas  51004 change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists a a change in use of property that is sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning special use or conditional use permit in accordance with may not be made except in accordance with subsections b d however this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed b if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located and all of the other requirements of this chapter appendix applicable to that use can be complied with permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot once conformity with this chapter appendix is achieved the property may not revert to its nonconforming status c if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located but all of the requirements of this chapter appendix applicable to that use cannot reasonably be complied with then the change is permissible if the planning board issues a special use permit authorizing the change this special use permit may be issued if the planning board finds in addition to any other findings that may be required by this chapter appendix that 1 the intended change will not result in a violation of   and 2 all of the applicable requirements of this chapter appendix that can reasonably be complied with will be complied with compliance with a requirement of this chapter appendix is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible and in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created d if the intended change in use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming then the change is permissible if the planning board issues a special use permit authorizing the change the planning board may issue the permit if it finds in addition to other findings that may be required by this chapter appendix that 1 the use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with either a zoning special use or conditional use permit  and 2 all of the conditions applicable to the special use permit authorized in c of this section are satisfied  and 3 the proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most affected by it and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the special use permit is applied for  51004 abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations a when a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of one hundred eighty 180 days or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes b if the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is discontinued for a consecutive period of one hundred eighty 180 days or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity then that property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use unless the planning board issues a special use permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations this special use permit may be issued if the planning board finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible ie cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation the special use permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be corrected c for purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section all of the buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole for example the failure to rent one 1 apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for one hundred eighty 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained but if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter d when a structure or operation made nonconforming by this chapter appendix is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this chapter appendix the one hundred eightyday period for purposes of this section begins to run on the effective date of this chapter appendix  51004 completion of nonconforming projects a all nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least one hundred eighty 180 days before the effective date of this chapter appendix as well as all nonconforming projects that are at least ten 10 percent completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date of this chapter appendix may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits so long as these permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired if a development is designed to be completed in stages this subsection shall apply only to the particular phase under construction in addition as provided in gs b neither this ordinance nor any amendment to it shall without the consent of the property owner affect any lot with respect to which a building permit has been issued pursuant to gs prior to the enactment of the ordinance making the change so long as the building permit remains valid unexpired and unrevoked b except as provided in a all work on any nonconforming project shall cease on the effective date of this chapter appendix and all permits previously issued for work on nonconforming projects may begin or may be continued only pursuant to a zoning special use conditional use or sign permit issued in accordance with this section by the individual or board authorized by this chapter appendix to issue permits for the type of development proposed the permitissuing authority shall issue such a permit if it finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed his position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the land use law as it existed before the effective date of this chapter appendix and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete his project as proposed in considering whether these findings may be made the permitissuing authority shall be guided by the following as well as other relevant considerations 1 all expenditures made to obtain or pursuant to a validly issued and unrevoked building zoning sign or special or conditional use permit shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this chapter appendix became effective 2 except as provided in subdivision b1 no expenditures made more than one hundred eighty 180 days before the effective date of this chapter appendix may be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this chapter appendix became effective an expenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure 3 to the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures for example a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditure to acquire a potential development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new classification as it was under the old for the expenditure can be recovered by a resale of the property 4 to the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of a conforming project a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made such expenditures 5 an expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant both in dollar amount and in terms of the total estimated cost of the proposed project and the ordinary business practices of the developer 6 a person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting the proposed development site could not be attributed to him 7 even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting a development site the permitissuing authority may still find that he acted in good faith if he did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance the permitissuing authority may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to undermine the proposed ordinance if it determines that at the time the expenditures were made either there was considerable doubt about whether any ordinance would ultimately be passed or it was not clear that the proposed ordinance would prohibit the intended development  and the developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures 8 in deciding whether a permit should be issued under this section the permitissuing authority shall not be limited to either denying a permit altogether or issuing a permit to complete the project or phases sections or stages thereof as originally proposed or approved upon proper submission of plans by the applicant the permitissuing authority may also issue a permit authorizing a development that is less nonconforming than the project as originally proposed or approved but that still does not comply with all the provisions of the ordinance making the project nonconforming c when it appears from the developers plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in phases stages segments or other discrete units the developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the developer can make the showing required under b in addition to the matters and subject to the guidelines set forth in subdivisions 1 6 of b the permitissuing authority shall in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project consider the following in addition to other relevant factors 1 whether any plans prepared or approved regarding uncompleted phases constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying architectural or engineering work 2 whether any improvements such as streets or utilities have been installed in phases not yet completed 3 whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed in such a manner or location or such a scale in anticipation of connection to or interrelationship with approved but uncompleted phases that the investment in such utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if such approved but uncompleted phases are constructed in conformity with existing regulations d the permitissuing authority shall not consider any application for the permit authorized by b that is submitted more than sixty 60 days after the effective date of this chapter appendix the permitissuing authority may waive this requirement for good cause shown but in no case may it extend the application deadline beyond one 1 year e the administrator shall send copies of this section to the persons listed as owners for tax purposes and developers if different from the owners of all properties in regard to which permits have been issued for nonconforming projects or in regard to which a nonconforming project is otherwise known to be in some stage of development this notice shall be sent by certified mail not less than fifteen 15 days before the effective date of this chapter appendix f the permitissuing authority shall establish expedited procedures for hearing applications for permits under this section these applications shall be heard whenever possible before the effective date of this chapter appendix so that construction work is not needlessly interrupted nonconforming signs signs in existence on the effective date of this ordinance which do not conform to the provisions of this ordinance but which were constructed erected affixed or maintained in compliance with all previous regulations shall be regarded as nonconforming signs although it is not the intent of the ordinance to encourage the continued use of nonconforming signs nonconforming signs shall be allowed to continue and a decision as to the continued existence and use or removal of such signs shall be controlled as follows 1 no nonconforming sign shall be changed to another nonconforming sign 2 no nonconforming sign shall have any changes made in the words or symbols used or the message displayed on the sign unless the sign is specifically designed for periodic change of message 3 no nonconforming sign shall be structurally altered so as to change the shape size type or design of the sign 4 no nonconforming sign shall be reestablished after the activity business or use to which it relates has been discontinued and such sign shall be removed 5 no nonconforming sign shall be reestablished and all remains of the sign must be removed after damage or destruction if the estimated expense of repairs exceeds fifty 50 percent of the estimated total value of the sign at the time of destruction if damaged by less than fifty 50 percent but repairs are not made within three 3 months of the time such damage occurred the nonconforming sign shall not be allowed to continue and must be removed 6 no nonconforming sign shall be relocated 7 normal maintenance and repair of a nonconforming sign is permitted providing the shape size type or design of the sign is not altered signs located on premises which come within the zoning jurisdiction of the town of tarboro after the effective date of this ordinance and which signs do not comply with the provisions of this ordinance shall be subject to the requirements listed above any nonconforming sign which is structurally altered relocated or replaced shall immediately be brought into compliance with all the provisions of this ordinance signs in existence on the effective date of this ordinance which do not comply with provisions regulating use of strobe lights zip lights flashing lights or rotating beacons  flags streamers or strings of lights  or permanently installed or situated merchandise shall be made to conform within ninety 90 days form the effective date of this ordinance the administrator shall order the removal of any sign maintained in violation of the provisions of this section for which removal procedures are herein prescribed accordingly the administrator shall give ninety 90 days written notice to the owner or lessee to remove the sign or to bring it into compliance with this ordinance if the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign within ninety 90 days after the ninetyday written notice has been given the administrator or his duly authorized representative may institute removal proceedings according to the procedures specified in gs termination of miscellaneous nonconforming situations a within one 1 year after the effective date of this ordinance any violation of c3 shall cease and thereafter any situation in violation of that subdivision shall no longer be regarded as a lawful nonconforming situation b within thirty 30 days after the effective date of this ordinance any violation of c4 shall cease and thereafter any situation in violation of that subdivision shall no longer be regarded as a lawful nonconforming situation c within sixty 60 days after the effective date of subsection 150d or any amendments thereto any violation of that section shall cease and thereafter any situation in violation of that subsection shall no longer be regarded as a lawful nonconforming situation  111008 reserved article ix  zoning districts and zoning map part i  zoning districts residential districts established a the following residential districts are hereby

when used in connection with a particular use in the table of permissible uses  the letter z means that the use is permissible in the indicated zone with a zoning permit issued by the administrator the letter c means a conditional use permit must be obtained from the town council b use of the designation zc for combination uses is explained in    4 5800 planning board jurisdiction over uses otherwise permissible with a zoning permit notwithstanding any other provisions of this article whenever the table of permissible uses interpreted in the light of the other provisions of this article provides that a use in a nonresidential zone or a nonconforming use in a residential zone is permissible with a zoning permit a special use permit shall nevertheless be required if the administrator finds that the proposed use would have an extraordinary impact on neighboring properties or the general public in making this determination the administrator shall consider among other factors whether the use is proposed for an undeveloped or previously developed lot whether the proposed use constitutes a change from one principal use classification to another whether the use is proposed for a site that poses peculiar traffic or other hazards or difficulties and whether the proposed use is substantially unique or is likely to have impacts that differ substantially from those presented by other uses that are permissible in the zoning district in question  51004 editors note  adopted  abolished the board of adjustment therefore section 148 is amended to read as herein set out formerly such section pertained to board of adjustment jurisdiction over uses otherwise permissible with a zoning permit permissible uses and specific exclusions a the presumption established by this chapter appendix is that all legitimate uses of land are permissible within at least one 1 zoning district in the towns planning jurisdiction therefore because the list of permissible uses set forth in table of permissible uses cannot be allinclusive those uses that are listed shall be interpreted liberally to include other uses that have similar impacts to the listed uses b if a use cannot be interpreted by the administrator for inclusion in the table of permissible uses  as provided for in a that use shall be prohibited table of permissible uses shall not be interpreted to allow a use in one 1 zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another specified use that is permissible in other zoning districts c without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions the following uses are specifically prohibited in all districts 1 any use that involves the manufacture handling sale distribution or storage of any highly combustible or explosive materials in violation of the towns fire prevention code 2 stockyards slaughterhouses rendering plants 3 use of a travel trailer as a temporary or permanent residence situations that do not comply with this subdivision on the effective date of this chapter appendix are required to conform within one 1 year see  4 use of a motor vehicle parked on a lot as a structure in which out of which or from which any goods are sold or stored any services are performed or other business is conducted situations that do not comply with this subdivision on the effective date of this chapter appendix are required to conform within thirty 30 days see  this subsection shall not however apply to temporary uses allowed in accordance with accessory uses a the table of permissible uses  classifies different principal uses according to their different impacts whenever an activity which may or may not be separately listed as a principal use in this table is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot or is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use for example a swimming pooltennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential subdivision or multifamily development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal uses even though such facilities if developed apart from a residential development would require a zoning permit use classification  b for purposes of interpreting a 1 a use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to the principal use  2 to be commonly associated with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not but only that the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness c without limiting the generality of subsections a and b the following activities are specifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses so long as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above 1 offices or studios within an enclosed building and used by an occupant of a residence located on the same lot as such building to carry on administrative or artistic activities of a commercial nature so long as such activities do not fall within the definition of a home occupation 2 hobbies or recreational activities of a noncommercial nature 3 yard sales or garage sales so long as such sales are not conducted on the same lot for more than three 3 days whether consecutive or not during any ninetyday period 4 the temporary use of a travel trailer camper or recreational vehicle by visitors to the occupant of a principal building so long as such temporary use does not exceed seven 7 days 5 daycare center providing services to five 5 nonresident children or less d without limiting the generality of subsections a and b the following activities shall not be regarded as accessory to a residential principal use and are prohibited in residential districts 1 parking or storage outside of a substantially enclosed structure of any motor vehicle that is neither currently licensed nor operational 2 on premises within use classifications   or  parking or storage outside a substantially enclosed structure of more than a total of five 5 vehicles or more than a total of two 2 vessels for purposes of this subsection d2 the term vehicle shall include an all terrain vehicle farm tractor golf cart house trailer moped motorcycle motor vehicle property hauling vehicle recreational vehicle road tractor trailer including boat trailer truck tractor or other vehicle other than a bicycle as these terms are defined in gs  20401 and the term vessel shall mean any type of watercraft or structure designed used or capable of being used as a means of transportation or habitation on the water a vessel upon a trailer shall be considered one unit this subdivision shall not apply to motor vehicles temporarily parked on the premises on an occasional basis by guests of the occupant of such premises 3 on premises within use classifications   or  parking or storage outside a substantially enclosed structure of currently licensed motor vehicles including trailers outside a driveway clearly designated as such by covering such area with an all weather surface or by delineating the edges of such area use of landscape timbers plantings or other materials this subdivision shall not apply to motor vehicles temporarily parked on the premises on an occasional basis by guests of the occupant of such premises 4 on any residential premises within use classifications   or  displaying motor vehicles for sale or trade under the following circumstances a displaying more than one such vehicle at any one time b during a twelve month period commencing on

other provisions of this chapter appendix no zoning or conditional use permit is necessary for the following uses 1 streets 2 electric power telephone telegraph cable television gas water and sewer lines wires or pipes together with supporting poles or structures located within a public rightofway 3 neighborhood utility facilities located within a public rightofway with the permission of the owner state or town of the rightofway change in use a a substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character or nature of the activity conducted on a lot changes this occurs whenever 1 the change involves a change from one principal use category to another 2 if the original use is a combination use  the relative proportion of space devoted to the individual principal uses that comprise the combination use changes to such an extent that the parking requirements for the overall use are altered 3 if the original use is a combination use the mixture of types of individual principal uses that comprise the combination use changes 4 if the original use is a planned residential development the relative proportions of different types of dwelling units change 5 if there is only one 1 business or enterprise conducted on the lot regardless of whether that business or enterprise consists of one 1 individual principal use or a combination use that business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in even though the new business or enterprise may be classified under the same principal use or combination use category as the previous type of business for example if there is only one 1 building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of that building moves out and is replaced by a clothing store that constitutes a change in use even though both tenants fall within principal use classification  however if the florist shop were replaced by another florist shop that would not constitute a change in use since the type of business or enterprise would not have changed moreover if the florist shop moved out of a rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store that would not constitute a change in use since there is more than one 1 business on the lot and the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot shopping center combination use has not changed b a mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice versa does not constitute a change in use whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two 2 active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than one hundred eighty 180 consecutive days or has been abandoned c a mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the name shall not be regarded as a change in use reserved combination uses a when a combination use comprises two 2 or more principal uses that require different types of permits zoning or conditional use then the permit authorizing the combination use shall be 1 a conditional use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a conditional use permit 2 a zoning permit in all other cases this is indicated in the table of permissible uses by the designation zc in each of the columns adjacent to the  classification b when a combination use consists of a singlefamily detached residential subdivision that is not structurally integrated see  and twofamily or multifamily uses the total density permissible on the entire tract shall be determined by having the developer indicate on the plans the portion of the total lot that will be developed for each purpose and calculating the density for each portion as if it were a separate lot c when a combination use consists of a singlefamily detached structurally integrated subdivision and twofamily or multifamily uses then the total density permissible on the entire tract shall be determined by dividing the area of the tract by the minimum square footage per dwelling unit specified in more specific use controls whenever a development could fall within more than one 1 use classification in the table of permissible uses  the classification that most closely and most specifically describes the development controls for example a small doctors office or clinic clearly falls within the  classification office and service operations conducted entirely indoors and designed to attract customers or clients to the premises however classification  physicians and dentists offices and clinics occupying not more than 10000 square feet of gross floor area more specifically covers this use and therefore is controlling   reserved

businesses in the city of denver city of denver january 1998  adult entertainment study new york department of city planning new york 1994  adult entertainment businesses in indianapolis an analysis city of indianapolis 1984 have indicated that a concentration of adult businesses can have significant negative impacts on the use and enjoyment of surrounding properties and that the establishment of adult uses offering onpremise entertainment frequently results in secondary impacts related to public safety and neighborhood property values studies have shown that a concentration of adult businesses is correlated to an increase in crime rates in the areas where such businesses are clustered regulation of these uses is necessary to insure that these adverse secondary effects do not contribute to the blighting of surrounding neighborhoods b the town council has also determined that adult uses should be separated from schools churches child care centers parks and playgrounds libraries and residential neighborhoods where children and young adults may congregate the council concludes that the negative secondary impacts of adult establishments are heightened when such uses are in proximity to residential areas or uses where children or young adults assemble it is the intent of this establish reasonable regulations to prevent the concentration of adult establishments

which the remainder may be developed shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of this section b if the proposed use of the remainder is a singlefamily detached residential subdivision then the lots in such subdivision may be reduced in accordance with the provisions of except that the developer need not set aside usable open space to the extent that an equivalent amount of land has previously been dedicated to the town in accordance with a c if the proposed use of the remainder is a twofamily or multifamily project then the permissible density at which the remainder may be developed shall be calculated by regarding the dedicated portion of the original lot as if it were still part of the lot proposed for development d if the portion of the tract that remains after

particular nature of a tract of land or the nature of the facilities proposed for installation or other factors the underlying objectives of this article may be achieved even though the standards are not adhered to with mathematical precision therefore the permitissuing body is authorized to permit minor deviations from these standards whenever it determines that the objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to them  and because of peculiarities in the developers tract of land or the facilities proposed it would be unreasonable to require strict adherence to these standards b whenever the permitissuing board authorizes some deviation from the standards set forth in this article pursuant to a the official record of action taken on the development

corrective action in accordance with the provisions of this article 11 notify the north carolina secretary of crime control and public safety of its intention to grant a variance under b4 at least thirty 30 days prior to the granting of the variance  12604 reserved location of boundaries of areas of special flood hazard as used in this article the term areas of special flood hazard refers in the first instance to certain areas whose boundaries are determined and can be located on the ground by reference to the specific fluvial characteristics set forth in the definitions of this term this term also refers to overlay zoning districts whose boundaries are the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard shown on the map referenced in subsections 25115 and 16 which boundaries are intended to correspond to the actual physical location of areas of special flood hazard these overlay districts thus differ from other zoning districts whose boundaries are established solely according to planning or policy rather than physical criteria therefore the administrator is authorized to make necessary interpretations as to the exact location of the boundaries of areas of special flood hazards if there appears to be a conflict between a mapped bound and actual field conditions such interpretations like other decisions of the administrator may be appealed to the planning board in accordance with the applicable provisions of this ordinance  12604 amendments to the official flood hazard zoning flood hazard boundary map variance procedures a amendments to the official flood hazard zoning and flood hazard boundary map 1 all requests for revisions of areas of special flood hazard boundaries and base flood elevations shall be reviewed and approved by the federal emergency

or c a private individual corporation firm or town agency has submitted plans for a channel improvement or relocation requiring an amendment to the official flood hazard boundary map b variance procedures 1 in passing upon an application for a variance the board of adjustment as established by shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors all standards specified in other sections of this ordinance and a the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  d the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e the necessity of the facility of a waterfront location where applicable f the availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding or erosion damage for the proposed use  g the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development h the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and  k the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance the planning board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 2 conditions for variances a variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal state or local laws regulations or ordinances b variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief c variances shall only be issued upon i a showing of good and sufficient cause  ii a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship  and iii a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisance cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local law or ordinances d any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions e the local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency upon request 3 variances may be issued for the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set forth in subsections 260b1 and 2 4 in addition to the factors to be considered under b1 and the conditions required by b2 the board of adjustment may grant a variance to allow new solid waste disposal facilities hazardous waste management facilities salvage yards or chemical storage facilities only if the board finds that all four of the following have been satisfied i the use serves a critical need in the community  ii no feasible location exists for the location of the use outside the 100year floodplain  iii the lowest floor of any structure is elevated above the base flood elevation or is designed to be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy  and iv the use complies with all other applicable laws and regulations  12604 regulations do not guarantee flood protection the degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulating purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes  12604 setbacks from streams outside designated areas of special flood hazard in an area that is located outside a designated area of special flood hazard but where a stream is located no building or fill may be located within a distance of the stream bank equal to five 5 times the width of the stream at the top of the bank or

extent practicable all development shall conform to the natural contours of the land and natural and preexisting manmade drainage ways shall remain undisturbed b to the extent practicable lot boundaries shall be made to coincide with natural and preexisting manmade drainage ways within subdivisions to avoid the creation of lots that can be built upon only by altering such drainage ways  7901 developments must drain properly a all developments shall be provided with a drainage system that is adequate to prevent the undue retention of surface water on the development site surface water shall not be regarded as unduly retained if 1 the retention results from a technique practice or device deliberately installed as part of an approved sedimentation or storm water runoff control plan  or 2 the retention is not substantially different in location or degree than that experienced by the development site in its predevelopment stage unless such retention presents a danger to health or safety b no surface water may be channeled or directed into a sanitary sewer c whenever practicable the drainage system of a development shall coordinate with and connect to the drainage systems or drainage ways on surrounding properties or streets d use of drainage swales rather than curb and gutter and storm sewers in subdivisions is provided for in private roads and access ways within unsubdivided developments shall utilize curb and gutter and storm drains to provide adequate drainage if the grade of such roads or access ways is too steep to provide drainage in another manner or if other sufficient reasons exist to require such construction e construction specifications for drainage swales curbs and gutters and storm drains are contained in appendix b  7901 stormwater management a the general standards contained in this section shall apply throughout the planning jurisdiction however developments located within watershed overlay districts shall comply with the applicable additional requirements of  and 269 b all developments shall be constructed and maintained so that adjacent properties are not unreasonably burdened with surface waters as a result of such developments more specifically 1 no development may be constructed or maintained so that such development unreasonably impedes the natural flow of water from higher adjacent properties across such development thereby unreasonably causing substantial damage to such higher adjacent properties  and 2 no development may be constructed or maintained so that surface waters from such development are unreasonably collected and channeled onto lower adjacent properties at such locations or at such volumes as to cause substantial damage to such lower adjacent properties c all developments shall contain an adequate drainage system for the property drainage of all surface water no new construction and no substantial improvements of a structure may take place unless the design of a drainage system is reviewed by the administrator to assure that 1 no surface water shall be channeled or directed into a sanitary sewer 2 where feasible the subdivider shall connect to an existing storm drainage system 3 where an existing storm drainage system cannot feasibly be extended to the subdivision a surface drainage system shall be designed to protect the proposed development from water damage 4 surface drainage courses shall have side slopes of not less than the natural angle of repose for the soil but not less than a three 3 to one 1 slope in which the course is constructed and courses shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the drainage area without flooding the adjacent properties 5 the proposed storm drainage system is consistent with the town of tarboro manual of standard design details and specifications see appendix b d a drainage plan shall be required for any development or use of land except for land developed or used for agricultural purposes which involves or would create more than twenty thousand 20000 square feet of impervious ground cover no building permit will be issued for any such development until the drainage plan is approved by the town engineer e a drainage plan submitted for approval under these provisions must include but is not limited to the following information a site plan showing existing and proposed buildings storm drainage facilities and ground cover  site construction plans and grading plans and drainage system  drainage facility design data including a drainage area map engineering calculations area of impervious cover and total land area f a drainage plan submitted for approval under these provisions will be proposed and approved using the standards of the town engineer g impervious cover for purposes of this section means any ground cover including asphalt concrete stone brick terrazzo roofing clay tile or any other natural or manmade material that resists the absorption of surface water h the standards of this section do not apply to structures or impervious ground cover in existence prior to adoption of these provisions and these previously existing areas will not be used in calculating the twenty thousand 20000 square feet used in c above i the town engineer will not approve a drainage plan if the impervious cover which would result would increase the storm water rate of runoff from the site unless measures are taken to control and limit the rate of runoff to the level which existed prior to the installation of the impervious cover this determination will be based on the expected tenyear flood a flood which could be expected to occur once in ten 10 years the town engineer will waive the requirement for a drainage plan if the land being developed is part of a larger project which has received prior approval for and has implemented an overall drainage plan so long as the rate of runoff from the property presently under consideration does not exceed that which was previously approved the town engineer may also waive any requirements for the detention of water when it would drain directly into land subject to the floodway regulations of the town  6793   7896   81197   7901 sedimentation and erosion control a no zoning special use or conditional use permit may be issued and final plat approval for subdivisions may not be given with respect to any development that would cause land disturbing activity requiring prior approval of an erosion and sedimentation control plan by the nc sedimentation control commission under gs 113a574 unless the commission has certified to the town either that 1 an erosion control plan has been submitted to and approved by the commission  or 2 the commission has examined the preliminary plans for the development and it reasonably appears that an erosion control plan can be approved upon submission by the developer of more detailed construction or design drawings however in this case construction of the development may not begin and no building permits may be issued until the commission approves the erosion control plan b for purposes of this section land disturbing activity means any use of the land by any person in residential industrial educational institutional or commercial development highway and road construction and maintenance that results in a change in the natural cover or topography and that may cause or contribute to sedimentation except activities that are exempt under gs 113a526 sedimentation occurs whenever solid particulate matter mineral or organic is transported by water air gravity or ice from the site of its origin c except where a larger buffer area is required for developments located in watershed overlay districts e all developments shall maintain a twentyfivefoot vegetated buffer along each side of a stream or natural drainageway the twentyfivefoot distance shall be measured from the top edge of the streambank or drainageway if no drainageway bank exists the centerline of the drainageway swale shall be used for measurement purposes the vegetated buffer shall remain undisturbed except as may be necessary to accommodate roads provided they cross at a horizontal angle of at least sixty 60 degrees utilities and their easements pedestrian paths and their easements and approved waterdependent uses such as marinas docks piers boat ramps and bridges in cases in which a twentyfivefoot buffer may not be practical nor desirable the planning board may consider a special exception if it finds that an acceptable alternative means of handling stormwater can be achieved without maintaining a twentyfivefoot vegetated buffer  6793   7901   51004 stormwater control structures a developments located within wpa overlay districts that have been

as permanent signs  41111   111014   11215   11215 determining the number of signs a for the purpose of determining the number of signs a sign shall be considered to be a single display surface or display device containing elements organized related and composed to form a unit where matter is displayed in a random manner without organized relationship of elements each element shall be considered a single sign b without limiting the generality of a a multisided sign shall be regarded as one 1 sign computation of sign area a the surface area of a sign shall be computed by including the entire area within a single continuous rectilinear perimeter of not more than eight 8 straight lines or a circle or an ellipse enclosing the extreme limits of the writing representation emblem or other display together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed but not including any supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself b if the sign consists of more than one 1 section or module all of the area including that between sections or modules shall be included in the computation of the sign area c with respect to twosided multisided or threedimensional signs the surface area shall be computed by including the total of all sides designed either to attract attention or communicate information that can be seen at one time by any person from any vantage point for example with respect to a typical twosided sign where a message is printed on both sides of a flat surface the sign surface area of one 1 side rather than the sum total of both sides shall be regarded as the total sign surface area of that sign since one can see only one 1 side of the sign from any vantage point d with respect to vshaped signs the surface area shall be calculated as in c above provided the angle of the intersecting sign planes does not exceed ninety 90 degrees if the angle of the intersecting sign planes exceeds ninety 90 degrees sign area shall be computed as it would for a onesided sign total sign surface area a unless otherwise provided in this article the total surface area devoted to all signs on any lot shall not exceed the limitations set forth in this section and all signs except temporary signs shall be included in this calculation b unless otherwise provided in this article or in supplementary use regulations the maximum sign surface area permitted on any lot in any residential district see  is four 4 square feet c subject to the other provisions of this section the maximum sign surface area permitted on any lot in an o and i district shall be determined by multiplying the number of linear feet of street frontage of the lot by zero and seventyfive one hundredths 075 feet however in no case may the total sign surface area exceed two hundred 200 square feet d subject to the other provisions of this section the maximum sign surface area permitted on any lot in a b1 district shall be determined by multiplying the number of linear feet of lot frontage by two and zero tenths 20 feet however in no case may the total sign surface area exceed three hundred 300 square feet e subject to the other provisions of this section the maximum sign surface area on any lot in the b2 b3 i1 or i2 districts shall be determined by multiplying the number of linear feet of street frontage of the lot by two and zero tenths 20 feet however in no case may the total sign surface area exceed four hundred 400 square feet f if a lot has frontage on more than one 1 street then the total sign surface area permitted on that lot shall be the sum of the sign surface area allotments related to each street on which the lot has frontage however the total sign surface area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lots total sign surface area allocation that is derived from frontage on that street g whenever a lot is situated such that it has no street frontage on any lot boundary and an applicant desires to install on such a lot a sign that is oriented toward a street then the total sign surface area permitted on that lot shall be the sign surface area that would be allowed if the lot boundary closest to the street toward which such sign is to be oriented fronted on such street the applicant shall be restricted to using only one 1 street and the closest lot boundary to this street for determining the total permitted sign surface area however the applicant shall be given the opportunity to determine the one 1 street used in the calculations h the total sign area delineated in this section may be allocated among the various types of permissible signs at the discretion of the sign permit applicant however the maximum sign area allocated to any one 1 particular type of sign is outlined in  therefore the total sign area determined by this section may not be attained in some cases because of the sign area cap for individual freestanding or wall signs for example a use in the b1 district with a one hundredfoot lot frontage and five hundred 500 square feet of building facade would be allowed a total sign area of two hundred 200 square feet 100 foot lot x 20   200 square feet if the sign permit applicant chose to erect the maximum size of freestanding sign of thirty 30 square feet 100 foot x 03   30 square feet only one hundred fifty 150 square feet of the remaining one hundred seventy 170 square feet 200 feet minus 30 feet total permissible sign area could be allocated to a wall sign due to the cap on the maximum size of wall signs 500 foot building wall surface area x 30 percent   150 square feet consequently the limited amount of wall surface area in this case would prevent the total sign area from being attained the amount of total permissible sign area not utilized for freestanding and wall signs could however be applied to other types of allowable signs freestanding sign surface area a for purposes of this section a side of a freestanding sign is any plane or flat surface included in the calculation of the total sign surface area as provided in for example wall signs typically have one 1 side freestanding signs typically have two 2 sides backtoback although foursided and other multisided signs are also common b subject to subsections c and e a single side of a freestanding sign may not exceed zero and three tenths 03 square feet in surface area for every linear foot of street frontage along the street toward which such sign is primarily oriented however in no case may a single side of a freestanding sign exceed fifty 50 square feet in surface area if the lot on which the sign is located has less than two hundred 200 feet of frontage on the street toward which that sign is primarily oriented seventyfive 75 square feet on lots with two hundred 200 or more but less than four hundred 400 feet of frontage and one hundred 100 square feet on lots with four hundred 400 or more feet of frontage c in the b2 b3 i1 and i2 districts a single side of a freestanding sign may not exceed one and zero tenths 10 square foot in sign surface area for every linear foot of street frontage along the street toward which such sign is primarily oriented however in no case may a single side of such signs exceed two hundred fifty 250 square feet in surface area d with respect to freestanding signs that have no discernible sides such as spheres or other shapes not composed of flat planes no such freestanding sign may exceed the maximum total surface area allowed under subsections b or c for a single side of a freestanding sign e a single side of a freestanding sign that is located immediately adjacent to an interstate grade four lane limited access highway which sign may extend to a height of seventy 70 feetsee e may not exceed five hundred 500 square feet  2 51297 wall sign surface area a the sign surface area on any sign located on a wall of a structure may not exceed thirty 30 percent of the total surface area of the wall on which the sign is located

administration required a the council recognizes that due to the particularities of any given development the inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in e may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs the former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots the latter situation results in a waste of money as well as a waste of space that could more desirably be used for valuable development or environmentally useful open space therefore as suggested in the permitissuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of e and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in a b without limiting the generality of the foregoing the permitissuing authority may allow deviations from the parking requirements set forth in e when it finds that 1 a residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly  2 a business is primarily oriented to walkin trade c whenever the permitissuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive parking requirements set forth in e it shall enter on the face of the permit the parking requirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation d if the permitissuing authority concludes based upon information it receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal that the presumption established by e for a particular use classification is erroneous it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the table of parking requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in parking space dimensions a subject to subsections b and c each parking space shall contain a rectangular area at least nineteen 19 feet long and nine 9 feet wide lines demarcating parking spaces may be drawn at various angles in relation to curbs or aisles so long as the parking spaces so created contain within them the rectangular area required by this section b in parking areas containing ten 10 or more parking spaces up to twenty 20 percent of the parking spaces may contain a rectangular area of only eight 8 feet in width by sixteen 16 feet in length if such spaces are provided they shall be conspicuously designated as reserved for small or compact cars only c wherever parking areas consist of spaces set aside for parallel parking the dimensions of such parking spaces shall be not less than twentytwo 22 feet by nine 9 feet d parking spaces designated for use by a handicapped person shall have a minimum width of thirteen 13 feet and a minimum of nineteen 19 feet and shall be permanently and conspicuously marked for use by handicapped persons the minimum number of parking spaces designed for use by a handicapped person shall be determined as follows total parking spaces required by this handicapped designated spaces 150 1 space 51 + 1 handicappeddesignated space per 50 total parking spaces required  6892 required widths of parking area aisles and driveways a parking area aisle widths shall conform to the following table which varies the width requirement according to the angle of parking parking angle feet aisle width 0 30 45 60 90 oneway traffic 13 11 13 18 24 twoway traffic 19 20 21 23 24 b driveways shall be not less than ten 10 feet in width for oneway traffic and eighteen 18 feet in width for twoway traffic except that tenfeetwide driveways are permissible for twoway traffic when the driveway is not longer than fifty 50 feet  it provides access to not more than six 6 spaces  and sufficient turning space is provided so that vehicles need not back into a public street general design requirements a unless no other practicable alternative is available vehicle accommodation areas shall be designed so that without resorting to extraordinary movements vehicles may exit such areas without backing onto a public street this requirement does not apply to parking areas consisting of driveways that serve one 1 or two 2 dwelling units although backing onto arterial streets is discouraged b vehicle accommodation areas of all developments shall be designed so that sanitation emergency and other public service vehicles can serve such developments without the necessity of backing unreasonable distances or making other dangerous or hazardous turning movements c every vehicle accommodation area shall be designed so that vehicles cannot extend beyond the perimeter of such area onto adjacent properties or public rightsofway such areas shall also be designed so that vehicles do not extend over sidewalks or tend to bump against or damage any wall vegetation or other obstruction d circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed safely without posing a danger to pedestrians or other vehicles and without interfering with parking areas e driveway entrances and exits to parking areas shall be designed in accordance with the provisions of f vehicle accommodation areas shall be landscaped in accordance with the provisions of vehicle accommodation area surfaces a vehicle accommodation areas are required to be graded and surfaced with asphalt or concrete vehicle accommodation areas paved with asphalt shall be constructed in the same manner as residential street surfaces appendix b  if concrete is used as the paving material vehicle accommodation areas shall be similarly constructed except that six 6 inches of concrete shall be used instead of two 2 inches of asphalt the town engineer may allow other paving materials to be used so long as the equivalent level of stability is achieved b parking spaces in areas paved with an impervious surface shall be appropriately demarcated with painted lines or other markings c vehicle accommodation areas shall be properly maintained in all respects in particular and without limiting the foregoing vehicle accommodation area surfaces shall be kept in good condition free from potholes etc and parking space lines or markings shall be kept clearly visible and distinct d for uses such as churches parks playgrounds ball fields stadiums fairgrounds and other similar outdoor recreation uses that take place in an infrequent or limited manor  grass parking or other pervious parking surfaces will be allowed for no more than fifty 50 percent of the required vehicle spaces where provided such alternative parking surfaces shall be maintained in a smooth wellgraded condition if parking demand is such that the grass or lawn is caused to be damaged or destroyed to the extent that it ceases to grow then paving of such an area in accordance with this section may be required  12808 joint use of required parking spaces a one 1 parking area may contain required spaces for several different uses but except as otherwise provided in this section the required space assigned to one 1 use may not be credited to any other use b to the extent that developments that wish to make joint use of the same parking spaces operate at different times the same spaces may be credited to both uses for example if a parking lot is used in connection with an office building on monday but is generally ninety 90 percent vacant on weekends another development that operates only on weekends could be credited with ninety 90 percent of the spaces on that lot or if a church parking lot is generally occupied only to fifty 50 percent of capacity on days other than sunday another development could make use of fifty 50 percent of the church lots spaces on those other days c if the joint use of the same parking spaces by two 2 or more principal uses involves satellite parking spaces then the provisions of are also applicable satellite parking a if the number of offstreet parking spaces required by this chapter appendix cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot where the principal use associated with these parking spaces is located then spaces may be provided on adjacent or nearby lots in accordance with the provisions of this section these offsite spaces are referred to in this section as satellite parking spaces b all such satellite parking spaces except spaces intended for employee use must be located within four hundred 400 feet of a public entrance of a principal building housing the use associated with such parking or within four hundred 400 feet of the lot on which the use associated with such parking is located if the use is not housed within any principal building satellite parking spaces intended for employee use may be located within any reasonable distance satellite parking spaces must be located in a zoning district which permits parking lots for the use intended c the developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this section must present satisfactory written evidence that he has the permission of the owner or other person in charge of the satellite parking spaces to use such spaces the developer must also sign an acknowledgement that the continuing validity of his permit depends upon his continuing ability to provide the requisite number of parking spaces special provisions for existing buildings notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter appendix whenever there exists a lot with one 1 or more structures on it constructed before   and a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot  and the parking requirements of that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking then the developer need only comply with the requirements of to the extent that parking space is practicably available on the lot where the development is located and satellite parking space is reasonably available as provided in however if satellite parking subsequently becomes reasonably available then it shall be a continuing condition of the permit authorizing development on such lot that the developer obtain satellite parking when it does become available loading and unloading areas a subject to e whenever the normal operation of any development requires that goods merchandise or equipment be routinely delivered to or shipped from that development a sufficient offstreet loading and unloading area must be provided in accordance with this section to accommodate the delivery or shipment operations in a safe and convenient manner b the loading and unloading area must be of sufficient size to accommodate the numbers and types of vehicles that are likely to use this area given the nature of the development in question the following table indicates the number and size of spaces that presumptively satisfy the standard set forth in this subsection however the permitissuing authority may require more or less loading and unloading area if reasonably necessary to satisfy the foregoing standard gross leasable area of building number of spaces with minimum dimensions of 12 feet  55 feet and overhead clearance of 14 feet from street grade 1000 19999 1 20000 79999 2 80000127999 3 128000191000 4 192000255999 5 256000319999 6 320000391999 7 plus one 1 for each additional 72000 square feet or fraction thereof c loading and unloading areas shall be so located and designed that the vehicles intended to use them can maneuver safely and conveniently to and from a public rightofway and complete the loading and unloading operations without obstructing or interfering with any public rightofway or any parking space or parking lot aisle d no area allocated to loading and unloading facilities may be used to satisfy the area requirements for offstreet parking nor shall any portion of any offstreet parking area be used to satisfy the area requirements for loading and unloading facilities e whenever there exists a lot with one 1 or more structures on it constructed before the effective date of this chapter appendix and a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot and the loading area requirements of this section cannot be satisfied because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for loading and unloading then the developer need only comply with this section to the extent reasonably possible reserved article xix  screening and trees part i  screening council findings concerning the need for screening requirements the council finds that 1 screening between two 2 lots lessens the transmission from one 1 lot to another of noise dust and glare 2 screening can lessen the visual pollution that may otherwise occur within an urbanized area even minimal screening can provide an impression of separation of spaces and more extensive screening can shield entirely one 1 use from the visual assault of an adjacent use 3 screening can establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion the degree of privacy varying with the intensity of the screening 4 the provisions of this part are necessary to safeguard the public health safety and welfare general screening standard every development shall provide and maintain sufficient screening so that 1 neighboring properties are shielded from any adverse external effects of that development  2 the development is shielded from the negative impacts of adjacent uses such as streets or railroads compliance with screening standard a the table set forth in in conjunction with the explanations in concerning the types of screens establishes screening requirements that presumptively satisfy the general standards established in however this table is only intended to establish a presumption and should be flexibly administered in accordance with b the numerical designations contained in the table of screening requirements  are keyed to the table of permissible uses  and the letter designations refer to types of screening as described in this table indicates the type of screening that is presumptively required between two 2 uses where such screening is required only one 1 of the two 2 adjoining uses is responsible for installing the screening the use assigned this responsibility is referred to as the burdened use in the other use is the benefitted use 1 to determine which of two 2 adjoining uses is required to install the screening find the use classification number of one 1 of the adjoining uses in the burdened use column and follow that column across the page to its intersection with the use classification number in the benefitted use column that corresponds to the other adjoining use if the intersecting square contains a letter then the use whose classification number is in the burdened column is responsible for installing that level of screening if the intersecting square does not contain a letter then begin the process again starting this time in the burdened column with the other adjoining use 2 to merely determine the type of screening a proposed new development must install begin under the burdened column with the use classification number of the proposed use and follow that line across the page to its intersection with the use classification number of each use that adjoins the property to be developed for each intersecting square that contains a letter the developer must install the level of screening indicated c if when the analysis described in subdivision b1 is performed the burdened use is an existing use but the required screening is not in place then this lack of screening shall constitute a nonconforming situation subject to all the provisions of of this chapter appendix d notwithstanding any other provision of this article a twofamily or multifamily development shall be required at the time of construction to install any screening that is required between it and adjacent existing uses according to the table set forth in regardless of whether in relation to such other uses the twofamily or multifamily development is the benefitted or burdened use descriptions of screens the following three 3 basic types of screens are hereby established and are used as the basis for the table of screening requirements set forth in 1 opaque screen type a a screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least six 6 feet with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at least twenty 20 feet an opaque screen is intended to exclude completely all visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of spacial separation the opaque screen may be composed of a wall fence landscaped earth berm planted vegetation or existing vegetation compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation the opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year at maturity the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten 10 feet wide the portion of intermittent visual obstructions may contain deciduous plants suggested planting patterns that will achieve this standard are included in appendix d 2 semiopaque screen type b a screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of three 3 feet with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque portion to a height of at least twenty 20 feet the semiopaque screen is intended to partially block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of the separation of spaces the semiopaque screen may be composed of a wall fence landscaped earth berm planted vegetation or existing vegetation compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation at maturity the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten 10 feet wide the zone of intermittent visual obstruction may contain deciduous plants suggested planting patterns which will achieve this standard are included in appendix d 3 broken screen type c a screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions from the ground to a height of at least twenty 20 feet the broken screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces it may be composed of a wall fence landscaped earth berm planted vegetation or existing vegetation compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation the screen may contain deciduous plants suggested planting patterns which will achieve this standard are included in appendix d table of screening requirements table of screening requirements burdened

relationships between them it is neither possible nor prudent to establish inflexible screening requirements therefore as provided in the permitissuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of may require either more intensive or less intensive screening whenever it finds such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in without imposing unnecessary costs on the developer b without limiting the generality of a the permitissuing authority may modify the presumptive requirements for 1 commercial developments located adjacent to residential uses in business zoning districts  2 commercial uses located adjacent to other commercial uses within the same zoning district  3 uses located within planned residential developments for screening requirements within planned residential developments see  c whenever the permitissuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive requirements set forth in it shall enter on the face of the permit the screening requirement that it imposes to meet the standard set forth in the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation d if the permitissuing authority concludes based upon information it receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal that a presumption established by is erroneous it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the table of screening requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in combination uses a in determining the screening requirements that apply between a combination use and another use the permitissuing authority shall proceed as if the principal uses that comprise the combination use were not combined and reach its determination accordingly relying on the table set forth in interpreted in the light of b when two 2 or more principal uses are combined to create a combination use screening shall not be required between the component principal uses unless they are clearly separated physically and screening is determined to be necessary to satisfy the standard set forth in subdivisions when undeveloped land is subdivided and undeveloped lots only are sold the subdivider shall not be required to install any screening however every attempt shall be made to retain existing vegetation screening shall be required if at all only when the lots are developed and the responsibility for installing such screening shall be determined in accordance with the other requirements of of this article however in residential districts the subdivider shall provide a buffer strip at least twenty 20 feet in depth or width in addition to the normal lot depth or width required adjacent to all arterial and collector highways all railroad rightsofway and industrial and commercial uses or zoning districts this strip shall be a part of the platted lots and shall have the following restrictions lettered on the face of the plat this strip is reserved for the planting of trees or shrubs by the owner  the building of structures hereon is prohibited maintenance of landscaping materials the owner of the property upon which the landscaping materials required by this article have been installed shall be responsible for the continued proper maintenance of all such landscaping materials landscaped areas shall be kept in a proper neat and orderly appearance and free from refuse and debris all unhealthy or dead plant material shall be replaced by the property owner failure to maintain the required landscape materials shall constitute a zoning violation and shall be remedied in accordance with the provisions of width of screened areas and vegetation adjacent to walls and fences the width of screened areas required in this article will be dependent upon the method of screening used but in no case shall the width be less than fifteen 15 feet when walls or fences are used to meet screening requirements vegetation shall at a minimum be planted on the benefitted side of the wall or fence sufficient to obstruct at least fifty 50 percent of the walls or fences surface exposed structural supports for the fence or wall shall be located on the burdened use side part ii  shading council findings and declaration of policy on shade trees a the council finds that 1 trees are proven producers of oxygen a necessary element for human survival  2 trees appreciably reduce the everincreasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air we breathe  3 trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify the air much like the airwasher devices used on commercial air conditioning systems  4 trees have an important role in neutralizing wastewater passing ground from the surface to groundwater tables and lower aquifers  5 trees root systems stabilize the groundwater tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation erosion control and flood control  6 trees are an invaluable physical aesthetic and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land reducing noise levels and glare and breaking the monotony of human developments on the land  and 7 for the reasons indicated in 6 trees have an important impact on the desirability of land and therefore on property values b based upon the findings set forth in a the council declares that it is not only desirable but essential to the health safety and welfare of all persons living or working within the towns planning jurisdiction to protect certain existing trees and under the circumstances set forth in this article to require the planting of new trees in certain types of developments retention and protection of large trees a every development shall retain all existing trees twelve 12 inches in diameter or more unless the retention of such trees would in the opinion of the administrator unreasonably burden the development b no excavation or other subsurface disturbance may be undertaken within the drip line of any tree twelve 12 inches in diameter or more and no impervious surface including but not limited to paving or buildings may be located within the drip line of any tree twelve 12 inches in diameter measured at a height of four and five tenths 45 feet above ground level or more unless compliance with this subsection would unreasonably burden the development for purposes of this subsection a drip line is defined as a perimeter formed by the points farthest away from the trunk of a tree where precipitation falling from the branches of that tree lands on the ground c the retention or protection of trees twelve 12 inches in diameter or more as provided in subsections a and b unreasonably burdens a development if to accomplish such retention or protection the desired location of improvements on a lot or the proposed activities on a lot would have to be substantially altered and such alteration would work an unreasonable hardship upon the developer d if space that would otherwise be devoted to parking cannot be so used because of the requirements of subsections a or b and as a result the parking requirements set forth in cannot be satisfied the number of required spaces may be reduced by the number of spaces lost because of the provisions of subsections a and b up to a maximum of fifteen 15 percent of the required spaces   reserved compliance with landscaping and screening standards no building permit shall be issued until a landscaping plan delineating how the requirements of this article will be met has been submitted to and approved by the town of tarboro development review committee and no certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the landscaping is completed as certified by an onsite inspection by the administrator unless a bond or other acceptable guarantee of improvements has been posted part iii  parking and loading area landscaping parking area landscaping a every vehicle accommodation area containing ten 10 or more parking spaces shall be landscaped in accordance with the standards delineated in the remainder of this section b a minimum fivefoot perpetually maintained natural or planted buffer yard must be provided to screen any vehicle accommodation area where such area is not screened visually by an intervening building from an adjoining street rightofway or property line the buffer yard shall contain at least one 1 tree for each sixty 60 linear feet of street frontage and each tree shall have a minimum caliper of one and five tenths 15 inches measured six 6 inches above the ground at the time of planting each tree shall be a species which can be expected to attain a minimum height of twenty 20 feet at maturity the required buffer yard shall also contain evergreen shrubs planted four 4 feet on center which are eighteen 18 to twentyfour 24 inches in height at the time of planting and are a species which can be expected to form a continuous landscape buffer at maturity a combination of natural vegetation fences walls and berms may be utilized to achieve the screening requirements of this section all trees and shrubs selected by the developer shall meet the standards set forth in appendix d land uses required by to provide a type a or b screen between adjoining uses or a street frontage are exempt from the requirements of this subsection all portions of the buffer yard not planted with trees or shrubs or covered by a wall or other barrier shall be planted with grass ground cover or natural mulch of a minimum depth of three 3 inches c a minimum of five 5 percent of the interior of a vehicle accommodation area shall be devoted to landscaping d vehicle accommodation areas shall be laid out and detailed to prevent vehicles from striking landscaping materials vehicles will be presumed to have a body overhang of three 3 feet six 6 inches  7896 part iv  screening of dumpsters screening of dumpsters a all solid waste collection dumpsters required by shall be screened if and to the extent that in the absence of screening they would be clearly visible to 1 persons located within any dwelling unit on residential property other than that where the dumpster is located 2 occupants customers or other invitees located within any building on nonresidential property other than that where the dumpster is located unless such other property is used primarily for purposes permitted exclusively in an i zoning district 3 persons travelling on any public street sidewalk or other public way b when dumpster screening is required under this section such screening shall be constructed installed and located to prevent or remedy the conditions requiring the screening part v  supplemental standards applicable to all landscaped areas irrigation a means of watering plant materials is recommended for all landscaped areas required in this article revegetation all areas cleared of existing vegetation shall be revegetated with grass and trees as soon as possible after being disturbed cleared areas for purposes of this ordinance shall not include the building footprint and a fifteenfoot area surrounding the building footprint such disturbed areas shall be replanted with domesticated warm season grass and trees of a species similar to those recommended in appendix d12 and d13 disturbed areas shall be replanted with one 1 tree for each seven hundred seven 707 square feet of disturbed area preservation of existing vegetation every attempt shall be made to preserve existing vegetation a minimum of fifty 50 percent of all areas not devoted to buildings streets drives parking and loading areas shall be maintained in a natural state unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the permitissuing authority that revegetation would meet the intent of this article and would provide a vegetative pattern superior to the existing natural vegetation specificity of plans all plans as required by this article shall be reviewed by the administrator and shall show the specific location of plant material to be planted and shall also show the specific location of plant material that will remain in addition plans shall show the size of plant material to be installed and any other pertinent information required by this article article xx  amendments amendments in general a amendments to the text of this chapter appendix or to the zoning map may be made in accordance with the provisions of this article b conditional zoning district requests shall be made in accordance with the provisions of c as provided in gs b amendments modifications supplements repeal or other changes in zoning regulations and restrictions and zone boundaries shall not be applicable

or changes as long as the permit remains valid and unexpired pursuant to gs unrevoked pursuant to gs or a vested right has been established pursuant to gs the provisions of of this ordinance and such vested right remains valid and unexpired d the administrator shall keep a record of all text amendments to provisions of this ordinance which involve regulations standards or procedures regarding public water supply watersheds as defined in e copies of all such amendments shall upon adoption be provided to the supervisor of the classification and standards group water quality nc division of environmental management under no circumstances shall an amendment be adopted which would cause this ordinance to violate the public water supply watershed rules as adopted by the nc environmental management commission  6793   1142013 initiation of amendments a any person or organization may petition the council to amend this ordinance the petition shall be filed with the administrator and

provided in   4 a description of the proposed map change or a summary of the specific objective of any proposed change in the text of this chapter appendix b petitions for amendments shall be submitted to the administrator fifteen 15 days prior to the date of the planning board meeting at which the petition will be reviewed if the submission deadline date falls on a saturday the application must be received by the preceding friday if the submission deadline date falls on a sunday the application must be received by the following monday c if a petition to rezone property is submitted under this section  and following the first publication of the required advertisement for the public hearing on the proposed rezoning the petition is either withdrawn by the applicant or the council takes final action on the proposed amendment then the town will not accept another petition seeking the rezoning of the same property for a period of one 1 year from the date the petition is withdrawn or the council takes final action on the proposed amendment  5806 planning board consideration of proposed amendments a upon receipt of a petition for an amendment the administrator shall forward the request to the planning board for its consideration b the planning board shall endeavor to review the proposed amendment in such a timely fashion that any recommendations it may have can be presented to the council at its next regularly scheduled meeting however if the planning board is not prepared to make such recommendations it may request the council to delay final action on the amendment until such time as the planning board can present its recommendations  2810 council action on amendments a if the planning board recommends the adoption of an amendment the town council shall schedule a public hearing on the petition b if the planning board recommends against the adoption of an amendment the petition shall be placed on the agenda of the town council for consideration if the town council approves the recommendations of the planning board the town council may summarily deny the petition and no public hearing need be held if the town council rejects the recommendation of the planning board a public hearing shall be scheduled c at the conclusion of a public hearing on the proposed amendment the council may proceed to vote on the proposed ordinance refer it to a committee for further study or take any other action consistent with its usual rules of procedure d the town council need not await the recommendations of the planning board before taking action on a proposed amendment nor is the council bound by any recommendations of the planning board that are before it at the time it takes action on a proposed amendment e the council is not

requirements however all trees must receive a certain degree of care especially during and immediately after planting in order to protect an investment in new trees the developer and his or her agents should follow these guidelines when planting a plant trees with a minimum caliper of two 2 inches measured six 6 inches above the ground and a root ball no smaller than two 2 feet in diameter and sixteen 16 inches in depth b the best times for planting are early spring and early fall trees planted in the summer run the risk of dehydration c plant all trees at least threeandahalf 312 feet from the end of headin parking spaces in order to prevent damage from car overhangs d dig the tree pit at least two 2 feet wider than the root ball and at least six 6 inches deeper than the balls vertical dimension e especially in areas where construction activity has compacted the soil the bottom of the pit should be scarified or loosened with a pick ax or shovel f after the pit is dug observe subsurface drainage conditions where poor drainage exists the tree pit should be dug at least an additional twelve 12 inches wider and the soil amended to allow roots to grow properly g backfill should include a proper mix of soil and fertilizer all roots must be completely covered backfill should be thoroughly watered as it is placed around the roots h immediately after it is planted the tree should be supported with stakes and straps to firmly hold it in place as its root system begins to develop remove stakes and ties after one 1 year i spread at least three 3 inches of mulch over the entire excavation in order to retain moisture and keep down weeds an additional threeinch saucer of mulch should be provided to form a basin around the trunk of the tree this saucer helps catch

for the coastal plain section of north carolina ease of maintenance tolerance of city conditions and availability from area nurseries when selecting new plantings for a particular site a developer should first consider the types of plants which are thriving on or near that site accordingly native north carolina species should often be favored however if an introduced species has proven highly
