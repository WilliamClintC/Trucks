nothing in this chapter shall affect any project commenced prior to the adoption of this chapter  stormwater management article i  general provisions purpose the purpose of this chapter is to reduce the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff from development sites in the city of lynchburg to the greatest extent possible by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the quantity and quality of stormwater runoff associated with land development by converting more or less natural landscapes to sites with impervious surfaces development can cause increases in the quantity and velocity of stormwater runoff and decreases in the water quality of stormwater runoff adverse impacts from development shall not be allowed to affect adjacent or downstream property owners the lynchburg city council has determined that the lands and waters comprising the watersheds of the city are valuable and important natural resources which provide subsistence for life therefore it is in the public interest to establish requirements to regulate the discharge of stormwater runoff from land development projects as provided for in this chapter the waters and waterways within the city are at times subjected to flooding such flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is also a danger to the natural resources of the city land development tends to accentuate such flooding by increasing stormwater runoff due to alteration of the hydrologic response of the watershed in changing from the undeveloped to the developed condition the flooding produced by the development of real property contributes increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and tends to increase channel erosion such flooding erosion and pollution constitute deterioration of the water resources of the city of lynchburg and downstream communities the adverse environmental effects of development can be limited by the regulation of stormwater runoff from such land development proper management of stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property reduce the effects of development on land and stream channel erosion assist in the attainment and maintenance of water quality standards reduce local flooding and maintain as nearly as possible the predevelopment runoff characteristics of the area procedures provided in this document to reduce stormwater runoff

of this zoning other applicable rules and regulations a lbcs hierarchy the lbcs function codes establish a fourdigit hierarchy of uses with digits to the right expressing greater specificity where no entry appears in the zoning district columns for example 100 1100 and 1110 the uses described more specifically in the rows below 1111 and 1112 in the above example indicate whether or not a specific use is authorized where an entry appears in the zoning district columns for a general use for example 2520 and also for a more specific use for example 2521 within the same classification the more specific code and its entry shall govern b permitted uses a p indicates the listed use is allowed by right within the respective zoning district subject to issuance of a permit in accordance with

interpretation of tables of authorized land uses a uses not specifically listed in the case where a use is not listed in the district use matrix in appendix a either as a specific lbcs classification or as an example and such use is not otherwise prohibited by law the zoning administrator shall determine as set forth below whether a substantially similar use exists in the use matrix if the zoning administrator determines that a substantially similar use exists then the regulations governing that use shall apply to the particular use not listed in making the determination the zoning administrator shall consider the national standards underlying the lbcs while also considering the citys particular needs for zoning and land use classification and shall apply to the following rules of construction 1 if a use is listed as a general classification in the use matrix appendix a table of authorized land uses while a more specific classification within the same industry classification is also listed the specific classification shall govern 2 because the list of permissible uses set forth in the use matrix cannot be allinclusive  those uses that are listed shall be interpreted by the zoning administrator to include other uses that have similar impacts to the uses listed in the table of authorized land uses 3 if the zoning administrator cannot interpret a use as substantially the same as a use listed in the table of authorized land uses that use shall be prohibited the zoning administrator shall not interpret the table of authorized land uses to allow a use in one zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another specified use that is permissible in other zoning districts 4 the zoning administrator may determine whether the use is substantially the same as a use listed in the table of authorized land uses by analyzing the north american industry classification system naics united states 2007 or latest edition for guidance 5 in analyzing the naics the zoning administrator may determine that the use is substantially the same as a use listed in the table of authorized land uses by considering the industry description and illustrative examples of the most specific naics classification that may apply to the use and the zoning administrator may compare uses across similar levels of specificity within the same naics classification and between naics and lbcs classifications b city uses use of land or facilities owned or leased by or subject to easements granted to the city of lynchburg shall not be subject to the

declared that a in the interest of the public health safety and general welfare it is necessary to prevent the creation or establishment of obstructions that are hazards to air navigation  b the creation or establishment of an obstruction has the potential for being a public nuisance and may injure the area served by the airports  c the prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished to the extent legally possible without compensation to the property owner   airport safety zones a safety zones established in order to carry out the provisions of this section there are hereby established certain zones which include all of the area and airspace of the city of lynchburg lying equal to and above the approach surfaces transitional surfaces horizontal surfaces and conical
