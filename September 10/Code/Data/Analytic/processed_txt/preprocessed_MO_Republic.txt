during periods of high water 3 prevent damage to roads bridges utilities and other valuable components of the communitys infrastructure from damage due to flood waters and erosion 4 prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality from storm water runoff  preserve and protect quality of the environment  and promote conservation of the citys natural resources ordinance  minimize floodwater and erosion damage to lawns recreational facilities and other outdoors improvements 6 minimize traffic hazards from runoff carried in streets and roads 7 comply with applicable state and federal laws and regulations 8 meet the foregoing goals in a manner which is cost effective and which minimizes the cost of housing and development while encouraging sound development practices 9 encourage innovative and cost effective planning and design of stormwater management facilities 10 encourage multiple purpose design of stormwater management facilities to provide opportunities for recreational use and other benefits to the community wherever possible the standards and criteria set forth herein provide the minimum standards for planning and design of stormwater facilities where a particular plan or design may be found to be in conflict with a specific standard achievement of the goals set forth above will have precedence b general planning and design principles 1 the city of republic recognizes that stormwater management is an important component of overall land use planning 2 the city of republic further recognizes that proper stormwater planning significantly reduces the longterm costs to the community both in terms of infrastructure cost and property losses due to flood damage it is much more cost effective to prevent flood damage by proper design and construction than to repair and remediate problems which have occurred planning and design 3 the following general principles must be followed in preparing the grading and storm drainage plans for all development sites a recognize the existing drainage system the storm drainage system differs from other utility systems in very important ways 1 there is an existing natural drainage system 2 it is only needed when runoff occurs 3 the capacity of the system varies greatly depending upon how much it rains 4 the system does not have to be constructed of manmade components in order to function city code b because of these characteristics there has been a historic inclination for fragmented planning and design of storm drainage facilities c proper planning of storm drainage facilities must begin with the recognition of the existing system and include necessary provisions for preserving or altering the existing system to meet the needs of proposed development or construction d methods of delineating existing watercourses are outlined in allow for increase in runoff rates due to future urbanization a as areas urbanize peak rates of runoff increase significantly the city of republic may require temporary detention and storage of increased volumes of urban runoff in order to minimize increases in flow rates as urbanization occurs however the cumulative effects of onsite detention are difficult to predict and control and development of comprehensive basinwide runoff models to determine these effects does not appear likely in the foreseeable future b for this reason design of storm drainage improvements must be based upon the assumption of fully urbanized conditions in the area under consideration no reduction in peak flow rates due to detention unless an approved runoff model has been developed for the drainage basin under consideration any detention storage facilities whose effects are considered must be located within approved drainage easements 5 provide for acceptance of runoff from upstream drainage areas a it is critical that provisions be made to receive runoff from upstream drainage areas drainage easements or public rightof way must extend to a point where the upstream drainage area is no greater than five 5 acres b drainage easements or public rightofway must extend to the point where existing watercourses enter the site where the upstream drainage area is five 5 acres or greater but does not discharge onto the site defined watercourse the drainage easement shall extend to the point of lowest elevation 6 provide a means to convey runoff across the site stormwater shall be conveyed across the site in a system of overland drainage ways and storm sewers overland drainage ways consists of streets open channels swales and overland flow within drainage easements 7 discharge of runoff to downstream properties ordinance runoff calculations  2 11252002 a concentrated runoff shall be discharged only into existing watercourses drainage easements or public road rightsofway where none of these exist a drainage easement which extends to the nearest watercourse drainage easement or public road rightofway must be obtained from the downstream property owner and proper provisions made for conveyance of the peak flow from the one percent 1% annual probability 100year storm within the drainage easement b one of the typical results of urbanization is that diffuse surface flow or sheet flow is replaced with concentrated points of discharge where concentrated flows are discharged to downstream properties proper provisions must be made to 1 allow the flow to spread over the same area as would have occurred for the same rate of flow prior to the development and 2 reduce the rate of velocity to rates at least equal to the predevelopment values at the same rate of flow 8 assess potential downstream flooding problems a it is important that a determination be made of conditions in the watershed downstream of each development site specifically it is important to determine whether there are existing structures which are subject to an unacceptable flooding hazard b if areas having an unacceptable flooding hazard occur downstream of a development site either onsite detention for peak flow control or mutually agreed offsite improvements will be required as set forth in assess potential water quality impacts on receiving waters sediment erosion and other water quality controls are required as set forth in drainage easements all areas subject to inundation during the major storm must be included in drainage easements specific standards for drainage easements to be provided for storm sewers open channels and detention facilities are set forth in this acceptable methods of determining stormwater runoff 1 general guidelines a for watersheds with a total tributary area less than two hundred 200 acres and a one percent 1% annual probability city code 100year fully developed discharge less than three hundred 300 cfs the design storm runoff may be analyzed using the rational formula b for watersheds with a total tributary area greater than two hundred 200 acres or with a one percent 1% annual probability 100year fully developed discharge greater than three hundred 300 cfs the design storm runoff shall be analyzed using an approved hydrograph method 2 rational formula a the rational formula when properly understood and applied can produce satisfactory results for urban storm sewer design the rational formula is as follows q   cia where q   peak discharge in cubic feet per second c   runoff coefficient which is the ratio of the maximum rate of runoff from the area to the average rate of rainfall intensity for the time of concentration i   average rainfall intensity in inches per hour for a duration equal to the time of concentration a   contributing watershed area in acres b the basic assumptions made when applying the rational formula are 1 the rainfall intensity is uniform over the basin during the entire storm duration 2 the maximum runoff rate occurs when the rainfall lasts as long or longer than the basin time of concentration 3 runoff response characteristics are relatively uniform over the entire basin 4 the time of concentration is the time required for the runoff from the most hydraulically remote part of the basin to reach the point of interest c the drainage basin should be divided into subbasins of a size where all of the basic assumptions apply 3 time of concentration ordinance a time of concentration etc is calculated by tc   ti + tt 5 minutes minimum where ti   initial inlet or overland flow time in minutes tt   shallow channel and open channel flow time in minutes b overland flow sheet flow time shall be calculated as ti   n x l08464 x s04 where ti   initial inlet or

lovegrass bluegrass buffalo grass blue grama grass and native grass mixtures city code when selecting n consider cover to a height of about 01 feet this is the only part of the plant cover that will obstruct sheet flow shallow channel velocities may be estimated from figure 31 in reference 11 open channel flow velocities may be estimated from mannings equation open channel velocities are generally estimated under bank full conditions the basin time of concentration calculation techniques are described in detail in tr55 reference 11 4 hydrograph methods a methodologies 1 the most common hydrograph techniques are those developed by the corps of engineers and the soil conservation service these methods are preferred however other proven techniques will be accepted 2 the corps of engineers hec1 flood hydrograph package and soil conservation service tr55 computer models are the preferred runoff models other models may be used with approval from the city 3 the runoff model must include the entire drainage basin upstream of the proposed development the model shall be prepared in sufficient detail to ensure that peak runoff rates are reasonably accurate 4 the runoff model shall be developed for the following cases a case 1 existing conditions in the drainage basin prior to development of the applicants property b case 2 existing conditions in the drainage basin with

between the inlet and outlet the flow encounters in the flow passageway a variety of configuration such as changes in pipe size branches bends junctions expansions and contractions these shape variations impose losses in addition to those resulting from pipe friction form losses are the result of fully developed turbulence and can be expressed as follows hl   k v22g 1003 where hl   head

storm design 1 expansion losses expansion losses in a storm sewer will occur when the sewer outlets into a channel the expansion will result in a shearing action between the incoming high velocity jet and the surrounding outlet boundary as a result much of the kinetic energy is dissipated by eddy currents and turbulence the loss head can be expressed as hl   kx v122g1a1a22 1004 where a   cross

value of kx is about one 10 for a sudden expansion such as an outlet to a channel and about twotenths 02 for a welldesigned expansion transition table ii presents the expansion loss coefficient for various flow conditions 2 contraction losses the form loss due to contraction is hl   kcv222g1a2a122 1005 where kc   contraction loss coefficient kc is equal to 05 for a sudden contraction and about 01 for a welldesigned transition subscripts 1 and 2 denote the upstream and downstream sections respectively table ii presents the contraction loss coefficient for various flow conditions 3 bend losses the head losses for bends in excess of that caused by an equivalent length of straight pipe may be expressed by the relation hl   kbv22g 1006 where kb   bend coefficient city code the bend coefficient has been found to be a function of a the ratio of the radius of curvature of the bend to the width of the conduit b deflection angle of the conduit c geometry of the cross section of flow and d the reynolds number and relative roughness recommended bend loss coefficients for standard bends radius pipe and bends are presented in table ii 4 junction and manhole losses a junction occurs where one 1 or more branch sewers enter a main sewer usually at manholes the hydraulic design of a junction is in effect the design of two 2 or more transitions one 1 for each flow path allowances should be made for head loss due to the impact at junctions the head loss at a junction for each pipe entering the junction can be calculated from hl   v222g   kjv122g 1007 where v2   the outfall flow

conditions encountered in the urban storm sewer system 5 partially full pipe flow when a storm sewer is not flowing full the sewer acts like an open channel and the hydraulic properties can be calculated using open channel 6 storm sewer outlets when the storm sewer system discharges into an open channel additional losses in the form of expansions losses occur at the outlet for a headwall and no wing walls the loss coefficient ke is one 10 for a headwall with fortyfive degree 45 wing walls the loss coefficient is about one and fourteen hundredths 114 for a flaredendsection which has a d2d1 ratio of two 2 and a theta angle of around thirty degrees 30 the loss coefficient is approximately onehalf 05 7 connection pipes a connector pipes are used to convey runoff from an inlet to the storm sewer if however the storm sewer runs inlet then a connector pipe is not ordinance needed connector pipes can connect a single inlet to the storm sewer or they can be connected in a series b these bends turns and flows connector pipe give rise to three 3 hydraulic losses a change from static to kinetic energy to get the water moving connector pipe an entrance loss from the inlet to the connector pipe and a friction loss along the length of the connector pipe the total head loss in the connector pipe can be calculated from the following equation hcp   hv + ke x hv + sf x l 1009 where hcp   head loss in the connector pipe feet ke   entrance loss coefficient hv   velocity head in the pipe assuming full pipe flow feet and the other variables are as previously defined the value of the entrance loss coefficient is determined from table ii c if the connector pipes are connected in series the head loss in each pipe is calculated from equation 1009 and the total head loss is the summation of the individual head losses 2 easements easements shall be provided for all storm sewers constructed in the city of republic that are not located within public rightsofway the minimum

or altered to meet the given requirements natural channels used as part of the drainage system must be evaluated for the effects of increased peak flow flow duration and volume of runoff due to urbanization b grass lined channels grass lined channels are the most desirable of the artificial channels the channel storage lower velocities and the greenbelt multiple use benefits obtained create significant advantages over other artificial channels unless existing development restricts the availability of right of way channels lined with grass should be given preference over other artificial types the minimum slope in a grasslined channel shall be one percent 10% unless a concrete low flow channel is installed c concrete lined channels concrete lined channels are sometimes required where right of way restrictions within existing development prohibit grasslined channels the lining must be designed to withstand the various forces and actions which tend to overtop the bank deteriorate the lining erode the soil beneath the lining and erode unlined areas the minimum slope in a concrete lined channel shall be onehalf percent 050% d rock lined channels rock lined channels are constructed from ordinary riprap or wire enclosed riprap gabions etc the rock lining permits higher design velocity than for grass lined channels rock linings will normally be used only for erosion control at culvertstorm sewer outlets at sharp channel bends at channel confluences and at locally steepened channel sections e other lining types the use of fabrics and other synthetic materials for channel linings has increased over the past several years proposed improvements of this type will be city code reviewed on an individual basis as for applicability and performance 2 hydraulics an open channel is a conduit in which water flows with a free surface the calculations for uniform and gradually varied flow are relatively straightforward and are based upon similar assumptions eg parallel streamlines the basic equations and computational procedures are presented in this uniform flow open channel flow is said to be uniform if the depth of flow is the same at every section of the channel

most common occurrence of gradually varied flow in storm drainage is the backwater created by culverts storm sewer inlets or channel constrictions for these conditions the flow depth will be greater than normal depth in the channel and the water surface profile must be computed using backwater techniques 2 backwater computations can be made using the methods presented in chow reference 1 many computer programs are available for computation of backwater curves the most widely used program is hec2 water surface profiles developed by the us army corps of engineers reference 2 and is the

flow width inundated by a 100year event plus fifteen 15 feet b all easements required for construction which are not included on the final plat shall be recorded and filed with the city prior to approval of the construction drawings a purpose ordinance  detention facilities are used to reduce storm water runoff rates by storing excess runoff 2 the usual function of a detention facilities is to provide sufficient storage such that peak runoff rates are not increased when development occurs b policy the primary goal of the city of republic stormwater management program is the prevention of flood damage to residential commercial and public property in adopting this policy city of republic recognizes that 1 there are many areas in the city where residential flooding occurs because of inadequately sized drainage ways 2 flooding depths and frequency will increase as development occurs upstream of these areas 3 detention basins are the only effective onsite means which can be used to control peak runoff storm water rates as areas develop 4 the city of republic further recognizes that a the best means to assure effective performance of a detention basin utilize is perform reservoir routing calculations using hydrographs b such methods have not been in widespread use in this area but rather a method known as the simplified volume formula has been the basis of city detention policy c use of the simplified volume formula frequently does not result in adequately sized detention facilities d the inaccuracy of the rational method upon which the simplified volume formula is based increases as the area under consideration increases e even though the simplified volume formula has severe limitations requirement of detailed analytical methods may not be justified in all cases f detention basins designed using the simplified volume formula do provide a minimal amount of flooding protection and potential water quality benefits by functioning as sediment basins 5 therefore in order to provide a reasonable level of flood protection to homes and businesses while maintaining a climate favorable for development and economic growth city of republic has established the following policy for design of detention facilities c methods of analysis the method of analysis to be required for the design of detention facilities will be determined as follows city code  detailed analysis will be required in the following cases a in areas where residences or other structures located downstream of a development can be shown to have an imminent flooding hazard a detailed analysis using hydrographs and reservoir routing techniques will be required b residences or other structures will be defined as having an imminent flooding hazard when the lowest point at which surface runoff may gain entry is located at or below the estimated flooding level which would result from a storm with an annual probability of one percent 1% or greater under conditions existing in the basin prior to development of the applicants property ie affected by the year storm c consideration of downstream flooding problems will be limited to the area which may reasonably be expected to be significantly affected by runoff from the applicants property d detailed analysis will be required for all detention facilities where the peak runoff rate from the area upstream of the detention facility offsite and onsite exceeds fifty 50 cfs cubic feet per second for a storm with an annual probability of one percent 1% the year storm under fully developed conditions note this would be the rate of flow from approximately twelve 12 acres for residential areas or five 5 acres for fully paved commercial areas 2 simplified analysis will be permitted in the following cases for areas where there are no imminent downstream flooding problems and where the peak runoff rate from the drainage area offsite and onsite upstream of the detention facility does not exceed fifty 50 cfs for the one percent 1% annual probability year storm under fully developed conditions the simplified volume formula may be used 3 alternatives to detention a fee in lieu of detention in cases where channelization or other improvements can be shown to be more effective than detention in reducing the flooding hazard to downstream properties and where no adverse effects to downstream properties will result from construction of such improvements the city may enter into an agreement with the applicant to accept compensation in lieu of constructing onsite detention facilities b the city has established the following formula for the fee in lieu of detention ordinance fee   k  ia acres of impervious surface added where ia is the increase in impervious area roofs pavement driveways patios etc in acres and k shall be determined as follows k shall equal ten thousand dollars $1000000 up to and including fortythree thousand five hundred sixty 43560 square feet one 1 acre of impervious area added plus five thousand dollars $500000 for impervious area added in excess of fortythree thousand five hundred sixty 43560 square feet one 1 acre k is a factor determined by the city this factor is based upon the net financial gain which the developer would realize if the detention facility is not built this amount will generally be equal to the construction cost of the detention facility plus revenue from sale of additional lots or increased value of lots less the cost of developing the lots including utilities and streets financing costs sales costs and reasonable profit the city shall evaluate this formula annually and make the appropriate adjustments c criteria for approving an alternative to detention the city will evaluate each request for an alternative design or fee in lieu of detention based on the following criteria the city of republic reserves the right to set precedent with each case considered depending upon the unique circumstances surrounding each request 1 size of site in relation to the stormwater generated 2 size of the site in relation to the drainage area 3 impact on properties downstream of site 4 areas of concern as identified by the city of republics stormwater master plan 5 location of the site with respect to floodplains streams or other large watercourses 6 location of the site with respect to environmentally sensitive areas 7 approval of previous requests city code  downstream impacts shall generally be considered insignificant when the added upstream impervious area is less than ten percent 10% of the total contributing watershed area exceptions to this rule include development where downstream areas are known to have an imminent flooding hazard as defined in residential subdivisions unless otherwise approved by the city of stormwater calculations and criteria referenced herein detention shall be required in all major residential subdivisions and the fee in lieu of detention established in c3a shall apply upon request by a developer the city may consider alternatives to the fee in lieu of detention in cases where it can be proven that the absence of detention will not adversely affect downstream property owners each request will be evaluated on a casebycase basis and a fee in lieu detention may be established for the purposes of regional improvements within the watershed or abroad in the city e justified exceptions the city may consider upon request a waiver of detention and the fee in lieu for sites in which the alteration of the site is inconsequential and will not substantially increase the runoff a justified exception will be granted for sites based on the following criteria 1 existing sites in which the addition of impervious surface will not increase more that five thousand 5000 square feet 2 sites in which existing gravel chat or stone parking lots or driveways are paved with asphalt cement or concrete surfaces this shall not apply to parking areas or circulation routes in which vegetation has consumed the site and altered the ability to shed or absorb runoff the city shall exercise strict discretion with respect to approving exceptions based on these criteria 3 sites in which a change in use has occurred that does not increase the impervious area of the site 4 subdivisions meeting the definition of a minor subdivision or the development of individual singlefamilyresidential homes on individual lots in existing subdivisions f procedure a request for approval of an alternative to detention must begin with the applicant providing the city with stormwater calculations for the increased runoff from the ordinance development in addition to providing calculations the applicant must submit a request for alternative design based on the criteria

requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails b restricted discharges an industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the restricted discharges in this it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge
