institutions industrial parks etc c design factors in determining the required capacities of sanitary sewers the following factors should be considered 1 maximum hourly sewerage flow 2 additional maximum sewage or waste flow from industrial plants 3 groundwater infiltration 4 topography of area 5 location of waste treatment plant 6 depth of excavation 7 pumping requirements d design basis 1 per capita flow new sewer systems shall be designed on the basis of an average daily per capita flow of sewage of not less than 100 gallons per day this figure is assumed to cover normal infiltration but an additional allowance should be made where conditions are unfavorable generally the sewers should be designed to carry when running full not less than the following daily per capita contributions of sewage exclusive of sewage or other waste flow from industrial plants a laterals and submain sewers 400 gallons b main trunk and outfall sewers 250 gallons c interceptors normally no interceptor shall be designed for less than 350% of the gauged or estimated average dry weather flow 2 alternate method when deviations from the foregoing per capita rates are demonstrated a description of the procedure used for sewer design shall be included e details of design and construction 1 minimum size no sewer shall be less than eight inches in diameter 2 depth in general sewers shall be sufficiently deep so as to receive sewage from basements and to prevent freezing 3 slope all sewers shall be so designed and constructed to give mean velocities when flowing full of not less than two feet per second based on kutters formula using an n value of  use of other practical n values may be permitted by the city if deemed justifiable on the basis of research or field data presented the following are the minimum slopes which should be provided  however slopes greater than these are desirable sewer size minimum slope in feet per 100 feet 8inch 040 10inch 028 12inch 022

for the two feet per second velocity when flowing full may be permitted such decreased slopes will only be considered where the depth of flow will be 03 of the diameter or greater for design average flow whenever such decreased slopes are selected the applicant must furnish with his report his computations of the depths of flow in such pipes at minimum average and daily or hourly rates of flow it must be recognized that decreased slopes may cause additional sewer maintenance expense sewers shall be laid with uniform slope between manholes sewers on 20% slope or greater shall be anchored securely with concrete anchors or approved equal spaced as follows a not over 36 feet center to center on grades 20% and up to 35% b not over 24 feet center to center on grades 35% and up to 50% c not

one the invert of the larger sewer should be lowered sufficiently to maintain the same energy gradient an approximate method for securing these results is to place the 08 depth point of both sewers at the same elevation 6 high velocity protection where velocities greater than 15 feet per second are attained special provision shall be made to protect against displacement by erosion and shock 7 materials any generally accepted material for sewers will be given consideration but the material selected should be adapted to local conditions such as character of industrial wastes possibility of

acceptable to the approving agency is assured i protection of water supplies 1 water supply interconnections there shall be no physical connection between a public or private potable water supply system and a sewer or appurtenance thereto which would permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable supply 2 relation to water works structures while no general statement can be made to cover all conditions it is generally recognized that sewers shall meet the requirements of the city with respect to minimum distances from public water supply wells or other water supply sources and structures 3 relation to water mains a horizontal separation whenever possible sewers should be laid at least ten feet horizontally from any existing or proposed water main should local conditions prevent a lateral separation of ten feet a sewer may be laid closer than ten feet to a water main if 1 it is laid in a separate trench 2 it is laid in the same trench with the water mains located at one side on a bench of undisturbed earth 3 in either case the elevation of the crown of the sewer is at least 18 inches below the invert of the water main b vertical separation whenever sewers must cross under water mains the sewer shall be laid at such an elevation that the top of the sewer is at least 18 inches below the bottom of the water main when the elevation of the sewer cannot be buried to meet the above requirement the water main shall be relocated to provide this separation or reconstructed with slip on or mechanical joint castiron pipe for a distance of ten feet on each side of the sewer one full length of water main should be centered over the sewer so that both joints will be as far from the sewer as possible c special conditions when it is impossible to obtain proper horizontal and vertical separation as stipulated above the water main should be constructed of slip on or mechanical joint castiron pipe and the sewer constructed of mechanical joint

conservation andor solar access because all forms of extracted energy sources commonly in use are in short supply and will apparently remain so for the near future and have infinite limits of economic recovery and ultimate depletion the city of newark strongly encourages energy conservation and efficiency and the city supports land use and development which leaves as many options open as possible for the use of traditional and alternative sources of energy in the future a general design and construction principles 1 in general to provide greater opportunity for southern orientation of windows roofs walls and buildings streets should run insofar as possible in an eastwest direction and lots insofar as possible should be sited on a northsouth axis 2 in general energy systems including supply elements furnaces burners tanks boilers distribution components storage containers heat exchangers piping or other transfer mechanisms controls and related structural support for transportation and storing and collected energy should include energy efficiency and conservation as a design and construction criterion 3 natural features of the site such as wooded areas and topography should be

engineering scale that measures the amount of traffic that a roadway or intersection can accommodate based on such factors as speed travel time traffic interruptions maneuverability comfort and convenience level of service is in the form of letter designations as follows 1 level of service a indicates a relatively free flow of traffic with little or no limitation on vehicle movement or speed 2 level of service b describes a steady flow of traffic with only slight delays in vehicle movement and speed all vehicle queues clear an intersection in a single signal cycle 3 level of service c describes a reasonably steady high volume flow of traffic with some limitations on movement and speed and occasional backups at intersections 4 level of service d describes the level where traffic nears an unstable flow intersections still function but short vehicle queues develop and vehicles may have to wait signal cycle during short traffic peaks 5 level of service e represents traffic characterized by slow movement and frequent although momentary stoppages this type of congestion is considered severe but is not uncommon at peak traffic hours with frequent stoppages longstanding vehicle queues and blocked intersections 6 level of service f describes unsatisfactory stop and go traffic characterized by traffic jams and stoppages of long duration vehicles at signalized intersections usually have to wait or more signal changes and nearby intersections may be blocked by the long vehicle queues e tis review criteria in reviewing traffic impact study comments from deldot the planning commission and council shall consider the following 1 subdivisions that result in a deldot indicated los of e or f with traffic and transportation mitigation measures do not meet the minimum acceptable standard subdivisions that result in a deldot indicated los of d may depending upon the circumstances and location of the subdivision require traffic and transportation
