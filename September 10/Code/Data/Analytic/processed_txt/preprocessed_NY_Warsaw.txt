living areas can be accomplished this section recognizes that while standard zoning changes are appropriate for the regulation of land use in neighborhood areas that are already substantially developed these techniques represent a type of regulatory rigidity and uniformity which will not permit the type of land development envisioned in the prd planned residential development district thus where planned residential development district techniques are deemed appropriate rezoning of land to a planned residential development district by the village board the set of use and dimensional specifications specified herein in schedule i53 shall be replaced by the approval process in which an approved plan becomes the basis for establishing land use controls b objectives in order to carry out the intent of this section the prd planned residential development district shall be designed to achieve the following objectives 1 the proposed residential development shall be in harmony with the general purpose goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan and this chapter 2 the proposed residential development shall comply with all applicable regulations of this chapter except as modified by the authority of this section 3 the proposed residential development shall not have a substantial adverse effect upon adjacent properties utility facilities traffic conditions and other matters that would affect the public health safety and general welfare 4 the proposed residential development shall be constructed arranged and operated so as to not interfere with the development and use of neighboring properties 5 the proposed residential development shall be adequately served by essential public facilities and services such as but not limited to sanitary sewers public water

proposed development would result in a more efficient and desirable development than may be accomplished by the use of conventional zoning categories or that it would ensure compatibility with surrounding development  nor shall such compliance by itself be sufficient to require the approval of the development plan or the approval of the zoning amendment to create a prd planned residential
