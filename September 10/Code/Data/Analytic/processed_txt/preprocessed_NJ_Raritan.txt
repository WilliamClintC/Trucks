the provision of an adequate system of transportation within the township 2 new residential and nonresidential development is aggregated in certain development areas such development causes and imposes demands on the township transportation system 3 planning projection indicate that such development will continue and will place ever increasing demands on the townships transportation system 4 to the extent that such development in aggregated areas place demands on the existing transportation system these demands which will necessitate significant improvements should be shifted in a fair and reasonable manner from the public at large to the developments actually creating the demands 5 the township committee after careful consideration finds and declares that it is necessary to establish a transportation improvement district tid1 and that the tid1 contribution imposed upon residential and nonresidential development in order to finance transportation improvements within the tid1 area the demand for which is created by both the residential and nonresidential development is in the best interest of the general welfare of the township and its residents and is equitable b intent this section is intended to impose a tid1 contribution at the time of certificate of occupancy issuance and as a condition precedent to such issuance in an amount based upon variables to reflect expected trip generation from non  residential development and number of units of residential development and to finance transportation improvements the demand for which is generated by new developments within the tid1 area the township is responsible for meeting its fair share of such improvements reflecting existing development and traffic volumes after studies by the townships traffic
