or as a condition of the approval or issuance of a final map parcel map certificate of compliance for a minor land division or a building permit which while necessary to serve development occurring on their property also adjoin other properties reduce the cost of additional development occurring on such other properties by eliminating the need for the construction and installation of such street facilities at the time such development occurs and by reason thereof directly benefit such other properties similarly the city and the chico redevelopment agency often construct and install street facilities adjoining properties located in the city which directly benefit such properties because such street facilities benefit adjoining properties the city council finds that it is equitable and proper to assess and levy a fee on the owners of such properties incident to and as a condition of additional development occurring on the properties in an amount equal to each propertys proportional share of the cost of constructing and installing the street facilities and to use the revenue derived from such fees for the purpose of reimbursing the initial developer the city or the chico redevelopment agency for the cost of constructing and installing that part of such street facilities which benefit such adjoining properties by reason of the foregoing the city council determines that there is a reasonable relationship between the street facilities the costs of which will be reimbursed with the fees assessed and levied pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and the development upon which such fees are imposed bthe city council finds that the revenues from the street facility reimbursement fees assessed and levied pursuant to this chapter will be used to reimburse developers the city or the chico redevelopment agency as and for the cost of that part of the street facilities constructed and installed by them which benefit the adjoining properties for which such fees are assessed in particular the city council finds that in accordance with the provisions of this chapter the revenue from the street facility reimbursement fees assessed and levied against an owner of

purposes of reimbursing developers the city or the chico redevelopment agency as and for the costs of constructing and installing street facilities which benefit adjoining properties will be in an amount equal to each such propertys proportional share of such costs in particular the city council finds that in accordance with the provisions of this chapter the amount of street facility fees assessed and levied pursuant to a memorandum of reimbursable street facility costs approved by the city council for an initial developer the city or the chico redevelopment agency in the manner provided by this chapter will be based on the product of the cost per foot of constructing such street facilities determined from the actual costs incurred by the initial developer the city or the

fees payment of cost recovery fees amount of liability administrative review appeal purpose this chapter is adopted pursuant to the municipal affairs provisions of the city charter for the following purposes ato provide for the recovery of costs incurred by the chico police department in the apprehension and arrest or citation of persons who are convicted of an offense involving the driving of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or any drug  and bto provide for the recovery of other costs incurred by the police and fire departments in responding to accidents caused by persons who are convicted of an offense involving the driving of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or any drug  findings the city council finds as follows athat persons who drive a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or any drug create a serious hazard to themselves and others  bthat the citys police and fire departments are required to spend a significant amount of time in the apprehension and arrest of persons who drive while under the influence of alcohol or any drug and in responding to accidents caused by such persons  cthat the time spent by the police and fire departments for that purpose is costly and precludes those departments from being available to respond to other calls or incidents  dthat although the california government at et seq provides that persons who drive a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or any drug shall reimburse the city for costs incurred in making appropriate emergency responses to incidents caused by such persons the scope of that cost recovery provision is insufficient because the apprehension and arrest of all drivers under the influence of alcohol or any drug are expensive and timeconsuming even though they may not require an emergency response  and ethat all persons who are apprehended or arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol or any drug as well as those who cause an accident and who are subsequently convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol or any drug should be required to reimburse the city for the costs incurred by the police department in such apprehension or arrest  civil liability any person who is arrested or cited by the chico police department for driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or any drug and who is subsequently convicted of such an offense shall be assessed a cost recovery fee for the purpose of reimbursing the city for all costs incurred by the police department which were related to the making of that arrest or issuance of that citation in addition if such driver caused an accident while under the influence of alcohol or any drug the cost recovery fee assessed shall also include any additional costs which were incurred by the fire or police departments in responding to that accident  liability upon conviction the civil liability imposed herein shall arise upon the conviction of a person for an offense involving the driving of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or any drug convictions giving rise to such liability shall include a conviction under vehicle or 231035 or any other violation of california law which requires a finding that the person drove a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or any drug the term shall include a plea of guilty or no contest as well as a finding of guilt by a judge or jury after a trial  notice of assessment of cost recovery fees upon the conviction of an offense giving rise to liability under the provisions of this chapter the chief of

amount of the sewer service fees water pollution control plant capacity fees trunkline capacity fees lift station capacity fees sewer main installation fees and sewer lateral installation fees to be assessed and levied upon an owner of premises utilizing such sewer service in order to fund the cost of constructing installing operating and maintaining the facilities necessary to provide the services  city council findings the city council makes the following findings required by of the california government regard to the water pollution control plant capacity fees trunkline capacity fees lift station capacity fees sewer main installation fees and sewer lateral installation fees assessed and levied pursuant to the provisions of this chapter athe city council finds that the only environmentally sound method to dispose of domestic and industrial wastewaters from residential and nonresidential development occurring in a community the size of the chico community is sewer facilities which like the citys sewer system are capable of collecting such wastewaters and treating the wastewaters to at least secondary treatment standards the city council also finds that there is a particular need for such community sewer facilities to serve residential and nonresidential development occurring in the chico community in that by reason of the high nitrate levels in the groundwaters underlying the chico community caused in large part by the individual septic tank and leach field waste disposal systems which now serve a significant segment of the chico community the regional water quality control board for the central valley region has adopted an order which requires existing development in the chico community to discontinue the use of such septic tank and leach field waste disposal systems no later than  and which prohibits the use of such septic tank and leach field waste disposal systems for new development occurring within the chico community on and after the date of such order save and except for septic tank and leach field waste disposal systems serving development whose density does not exceed the equivalent of one residential dwelling unit per acre by reason of the foregoing the city council finds that new development would be unable to proceed in the city or other parts of the chico community without the community sewer facilities to be funded with the water pollution control plant capacity fees trunkline capacity fees lift station capacity fees sewer main installation fees and sewer lateral installation fees assessed and levied pursuant to the provisions of this chapter accordingly the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the public facilities to be funded with such fees and the residential and nonresidential development upon which such fees are imposed bthe city council finds that all revenues from the water pollution control plant capacity fees trunkline capacity fees lift station capacity fees sewer main installation fees and sewer lateral installation fees assessed and levied on residential and nonresidential development pursuant to the provisions of this chapter must be used for the purpose of providing additional capacity in the city water pollution control plant sewer trunklines sewer lift stations sewer main facilities and sewer lateral facilities sufficient in amount to replace the sewer facilities or capacity in such sewer facilities which is utilized by such development andor to pay any debt or other obligation incurred by the city in previously providing the sewer facilities or capacity in such sewer facilities which is utilized by such development by reason of the foregoing the city council finds that the water pollution control plant capacity fees trunkline capacity fees lift station capacity fees sewer main installation fees and sewer lateral installation fees assessed and levied on residential and nonresidential development pursuant to the provisions of this chapter provide an ongoing means for immediately making capacity in the citys sewer system available to new development as such development occurs accordingly the city council determines that there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the water pollution control plant capacity fees trunkline capacity fees lift station capacity fees sewer main installation fees and sewer lateral installation fees provided for by this chapter and the residential and nonresidential development upon which such fees are imposed cit is the intent of the city council that all water pollution control plant capacity fees trunkline capacity fees lift station capacity fees sewer main installation fees and sewer lateral installation fees assessed and levied on residential and nonresidential development pursuant to the provisions of this chapter be based on the replacement cost of capacity in the city water pollution control plant sewer trunklines sewer lift stations sewer main facilities and sewer lateral facilities which is utilized by such development towards this end city council decisions to adopt the water pollution control plant capacity fees trunkline capacity fees lift station capacity fees sewer main installation fees and sewer lateral installation fees provided for by this chapter as well as city council decisions to increase or decrease any such fees have and will continue to be based on a connection fee nexus report prepared by or under the direction of the director such reports set forth the various factors and calculations considered and made in establishing such fees in addition such reports demonstrate that the particular fee or fees addressed by the report are in fact less than or equal to the replacement cost of the sewer system facilities utilized by the residential or nonresidential development for which the fee is assessed following a city council decision to adopt increase or decrease any such fee copies of the report are maintained on file in the office of the city clerk at all times the fee remains in effect accordingly the city council has provided the means for establishing and documenting the reasonable relationship between the amount of the water pollution control plant capacity fees trunkline capacity fees lift station capacity fees sewer main installation fees and sewer lateral installation fees provided for by this chapter and the cost of the water pollution control plant facilities sewer trunkline facilities sewer lift station facilities sewer main facilities and sewer lateral facilities attributable to the residential or

effects notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter to the contrary the advisory agency incident to and as a condition of the approval of a tentative map or tentative parcel map for any residential or nonresidential subdivision may require the dedication of park and recreation facilities at any location and in any amount which the advisory agency determines is necessary in order to substantially mitigate an adverse environmental effect identified in an environmental impact report provided in connection with the approval of such tentative map or tentative parcel map part dedication of land for riparian habitat purpose findings definitions riparian habitat dedication requirements location and amount of land to be dedicated for riparian habitat use of dedicated riparian habitat lease of riparian habitats to chico area recreation and park district dedication of additional riparian habitat to mitigate significant environmental effects purposes this chapter is enacted pursuant to the municipal affairs provisions of the city charter for the purpose of requiring the dedication of land along the banks of certain designated watercourses within the city incident to the approval of a minor land division tentative map or tentative parcel map for subdivisions which adjoin or include such watercourses in order to provide for the preservation andor propagation of riparian habitats within and along the banks of the watercourses part findings in enacting this chapter the city council makes the following findings in regard to the value of riparian habitats and the need for the dedication of land for such habitats incident to or as a condition of the approval of a minor land division tentative map or tentative parcel map for subdivisions adjoining certain designated watercourses athe council finds that within the city there exist five watercourses generally known as big chico creek little chico creek comanche creek lindo channel and sycamore creek each of which supports or is capable of supporting valuable riparian plant communities both within and along the banks of such watercourses such riparian plant communities offer refuge to urban wildlife and migrating birds reduce the possibility of flood damage to public and private property protect stream banks from erosion and contribute significantly to the quality of the waters flowing watercourses by reason thereof the preservation and enhancement of such riparian plant communities is important to the wellbeing safety and health of the residents and occupants of new development occurring within the chico community adjacent to such watercourses bthe council further finds that in order to preserve and enhance the riparian plant communities within and along big chico creek little chico creek comanche creek lindo channel and sycamore creek it is necessary to preclude new development occurring adjacent to such watercourses from destroying existing riparian plant communities occurring within or along the banks of the watercourses or from encroaching on or near the watercourses in a manner which would interfere with the initiation and propagation of new riparian plant communities toward this end the council has determined that the only practicable way to preclude such new development from destroying or interfering with the initiation and propagation of such riparian plant communities is to require the owners of the new development to dedicate land within and along the banks of such watercourses to the city incident to or as a condition of the approval of any minor land division tentative map or tentative parcel map for a subdivision bordering the watercourses so that such riparian plant communities can be placed under public stewardship and control cmoreover the council finds that since destruction of existing riparian plant communities andor interference with the initiation and propagation of new riparian plant communities within or along the banks of big chico creek little chico creek comanche creek lindo channel and sycamore creek is a significant adverse environmental effect which is likely to result from new development occurring adjacent to such watercourses the california environmental quality act as set forth in et seq of the california public resources precludes approval of a minor land division tentative map or tentative parcel map for any subdivision bordering the watercourses unless and until provisions have been made to substantially mitigate such adverse environmental effect in this regard the council has determined that the most logical and feasible way to mitigate such adverse environmental effect is to require the owners of each new subdivision bordering such watercourses to dedicate lands within and along the banks of the watercourses to the city so that the city can preserve propagate and maintain existing or new riparian plant communities within and along the banks of the watercourses as part of a comprehensive and coordinated program all for the benefit of the chico community including in particular the residents and occupants of new development occurring within subdivisions adjacent to the watercourses dby reason of the foregoing the council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the dedication of lands for riparian plant communities required by this chapter incident to or as a condition of the approval of a minor land division tentative map or tentative parcel map for a subdivision bordering big chico creek little chico creek comanche creek lindo channel or sycamore creek and the public needs created by such subdivisions in particular the council finds that the dedication of such lands is necessary to ensure the preservation and enhancement of the riparian plant communities and associated riparian habitats within and along the banks of such watercourses which are of benefit to the residents and occupants of such subdivisions and that the dedication of such lands is the most logical way to mitigate the adverse environmental effects which would occur in the event development occurring within such subdivisions was allowed to encroach on the banks of such watercourses so as to destroy or prevent the development of such riparian plant communities part definitions unless the contrary is stated or clearly appears from the context the following definitions shall govern the construction of the words and phrases used in this chapter developable area of a subdivision the phrase developable area of a subdivision means the total area of all land within the subdivision save and except for the area of any land within the outer banks of the watercourses known as big chico creek little chico creek comanche creek lindo channel and sycamore creek bouter banks the term outer banks means the upper elevation of land having a slope not exceeding ten percent which confines to the channel waters flowing in a watercourse in their normal course of winter flow criparian

such watercourse which is of varying widths and includes all or a portion of such existing riparian plant community provided that the area of land required to be dedicated to the city for riparian plant communities upland of the outer banks of the watercourse pursuant to this subsection does not exceed the total area of land which otherwise would have been required to be dedicated to the city pursuant to subsection a2 of this section climitations on the dedication of upland riparian habitat where a subdivision subject to the provisions of this chapter is of such size or configuration that the dedication of the twentyfive foot strip of land upland of the outer banks of an adjoining watercourse would result in the loss of more than twentyfive percent of the remaining developable area of

adopted pursuant to of this code for the purpose of regulating public events conducted in city parks and playgrounds in order to ensure that such events are carried out in a safe manner in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the use of such parks and playgrounds by other members of the general public not participating in the events and in a manner which does not damage park or playground property including in particular park and playground landscaping or natural vegetation and in order to require persons sponsoring or conducting a public event to pay a park use fee based on a fair share of that part of the cost of operating and maintaining the citys parks and playgrounds which is reasonably attributable to the use of the parks and playgrounds for such public event res no 153 9293 3 part 12rfindings the bidwell park and playground commission finds as follows athat it is in the public interest to regulate the use of the citys parks and playgrounds for public events in order to ensure that such events are carried out in a safe manner in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the use of such parks and playgrounds by other members of the general public not participating in the public event and in a manner which does not damage park and playground property including in particular park and playground landscaping or natural vegetation and in order to require persons utilizing the citys parks and playgrounds for a public event to pay a park use fee based on a fair share of that part of the cost of operating and maintaining such parks and playgrounds which is reasonably attributable to the use of the parks and playgrounds for the public event  bthat in regulating the use of the citys parks and playgrounds for public events recognition must be given to the fact that certain city parks and playgrounds or portions of such parks and playgrounds have been historically used for such events or are particularly suited to be used for the events including in particular events involving the exercise of free speech rights and that by reason thereof the conduct of public events in city parks and playgrounds or portions of such parks and playgrounds designated in this chapter as intensive use areas can best be regulated expeditious issuance of ministerial permits authorizing such events by the director where the public event does not exceed 10 hours in duration except in those cases in which there are specific grounds for denying such permits all as hereinafter provided for by this chapter  cthat in regulating the use of the citys parks and playgrounds for public events recognition must also be given to the fact that certain parks and playgrounds or portions of such parks and playgrounds such as portions of bidwell park and citys creekside greenways have historically been used as open space dedicated to passive recreational uses requiring peace quiet and tranquillity or dedicated to recreational uses which may be incompatible with the conduct of certain public events and that by reason thereof the conduct of public events in city parks and playgrounds or portions of such parks and playgrounds described in this chapter as nonintensive use areas can best be regulated by providing for the issuance of discretionary permits authorizing such events by the bidwell park and playground commission in those cases in which the commission finds that approval of the event is in the public interest and will not unreasonably interfere with the use of such nonintensive use areas of the citys parks and playgrounds by other members of the general public not participating in the event also in the manner hereinafter provided by this chapter  dthat in regulating the use of the citys parks and playgrounds for public events further recognition must be given to the fact that even in an intensive use area of a city park or playground such events conducted in such intensive use area for extended periods of time in excess of ten hours might unreasonably interfere with the use of intensive use areas by other members of the general public not participating in the event and that by reason thereof events in intensive use areas exceeding ten hours in duration can best be regulated by providing for the issuance of discretionary permits authorizing such event by the bidwell park and playground commission in those cases in which the commission finds that approval of the event is nevertheless in the public interest also in the manner hereinafter provided for by this chapter  and ethat in regulating public events in which persons participating in or viewing the event are charged a fee or solicited for a donation or which include the sale of food beverages or merchandise andor the rental of equipment or other things the director should be vested with authority to issue a ministerial permit for such public event only in those cases in which the event is conducted by a nonprofit organization providing a service of benefit to the chico community and that the bidwell park and playground commission should retain sole authority to issue a discretionary permit authorizing the event in those cases in

pollutant abundance in storm water and iii soluble fraction of pollutant in addition the distance of the groundwater table from the infiltration bmp may also be a factor determining the risk of contamination a water table distance separation of ten feet in depth in california presumptively poses negligible risk for storm water not associated with industrial activity or high vehicular traffic site specific conditions must be evaluated when determining the most appropriate bmp additionally monitoring and maintenance must be provided to ensure groundwater is protected and that the

criteria rdesign criteria 19rdesign criteria    within the foothill area the following design criteria shall be implemented whenever applicable aterrain alteration the project shall be designed to fit the terrain rather than altering the terrain to fit the project development patterns which form visually protruding horizontal bands or steeply cut slopes for roads or lots shall be avoided bstreet layout streets shall follow the natural contours of the terrain where possible to minimize the need for grading culdesacs and loop roads are encouraged where necessary to fit the natural topography subject to the approval of the city engineer and fire department csite and structure design site design should utilize varying setbacks structure heights splitlevel foundations and retaining walls to blend structures into the terrain dlot line locations where possible lot lines shall be placed at the top of slope areas to help ensure that the slope will not be neglected elocation of structures structures should be sited in a manner that will 1minimize the creation of flat pads by using compact splitlevel designs 2preserve vistas from public places 3preserve to the extent feasible visually significant rock outcroppings natural hydrology native plant materials and areas of visual significance farchitectural design buildings should be designed with the following principles in mind 1building forms should be scaled to complement the character of the foothills and to avoid excessively massive forms that dominate views of the foothills 2building facades should change plane and use overhangs as a means to create changing shadow lines to further break up massive forms 3wall surfaces facing viewshed areas should be minimized use of single story elements setbacks roof pitches and landscaping see figure 2 4roof pitches should generally be placed to follow the angle of the slope  but variation should be provided to avoid a monotonous appearance see figure 3 gcolors and materials a harmonious mixture of materials color and forms should be used to blend structures with the natural appearance of the foothills 1based upon the graphic principle that dark colors recede and light colors project medium to dark earth tone colors should be used for building elevations and roof materials in viewsensitive areas 2surface materials should be roughtextured to blend with the coarseness of landscaping and natural vegetation textured stucco wood natural brick and coarse block are appropriate 3roof materials should be roughtextured and be a class b material as defined in the uniform building roof colors should utilize darker tones including browns grays greens and terra cotta bright colors should be avoided hexterior lighting night views of the foothills should not be dominated by an array of bright lights lighting within viewsensitive areas should be properly shielded to avoid glare and the spill of light to surrounding areas lowlevel lighting and the use of multiple low fixtures is encouraged as opposed to the use of fewer but taller fixtures iretaining walls large retaining walls in a uniform plane shall be avoided break retaining walls into elements and terraces and use landscaping to screen them from view generally no retaining wall should be higher than 5 feet jopen space preservation open space may be preserved by reducing the width of street improvements using common driveways and clustering units subject to the approval of the city engineer and fire department kslope restoration transitional slopes shall be replanted with noninvasive but self sufficient trees shrubs and groundcover that are compatible with existing surrounding vegetation to enhance the blending of manufactured and natural slopes lreduced street widths streets may be designed without parking lanes when the result is a substantial decrease in cutting andor filling offstreet parking areas shall be provided at a ratio of one additional space per dwelling unit if parking is allowed on one side of the adjacent street and two additional spaces per dwelling unit if there is no onstreet parking streets may be reduced as provided for in title 18r design criteria and improvement standards mpreservation of ridgelines ridgelines should be preserved as much as possible structures located adjacent to prominent ridgelines should complement rather than provide a stark contrast with the natural landforms through careful placement development can help preserve vistas and landforms and maintain positive visual impact res no 27 9900 1 and 2
