been overestimated at the time of building permit issuance or use approval and the estimated level of use has not been reached at least three 3 years after the fee has been calculated or the use of the property has changed the city may charge the user an additional capacity replacement fee or reduce the capacity replacement fee amount for demonstrated usage of the system that differs from that

facilities regulations it is the purpose of these provisions to delineate restrictions development standards and siting criteria and establish removal procedures in order to protect the city from the uncontrolled siting of wireless communication facilities in locations that have significant adverse effects and cause irreparable harm it is further the purpose of these provisions a to protect the communitys visual quality and safety while facilitating the reasonable and balanced provision of wireless communication services more specifically it is the citys goal to minimize the visual impact of wireless communication facilities on the community particularly in and near residential zones  b to promote and protect the public health safety and welfare preserve the aesthetic character of the post falls community and to reasonably regulate the development and operation of wireless communication facilities within the city to the extent permitted under state and federal law  c to minimize the impact of wireless communication facilities by establishing standards for siting design and screening  d to preserve the opportunity for continued and growing service from the wireless industry  e to accommodate the growing need and demand for wireless communication services  f to establish clear guidelines and standards and an orderly process for review intended to facilitate the deployment of wireless transmission equipment to provide advanced communication services to the city its residents businesses and community at large  g to ensure city zoning regulations are applied consistently with federal and state telecommunications laws rules regulations and controlling court decisions  and h to provide regulations which are specifically not intended to and shall not be interpreted or applied to 1 prohibit or effectively prohibit the provision of wireless services 2 unreasonably discriminate among functionally equivalent service providers or 3 regulate wireless communication
