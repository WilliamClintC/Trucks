first amendment protected adultoriented establishments  1 findings of fact a the common council finds that adultoriented establishments as defined and otherwise regulated by the city in its

incorporated in city of renton v playtime theaters inc  475 us 41 1986 coleman a young v american minitheaters inc  427 us 50 1976 the common council finds that there is convincing evidence that the

outlet for first amendment protected activities e in order to minimize and control the secondary effects of adultoriented establishments upon the city it is the intent of the common council to prevent the concentration of adultoriented establishments within a certain distance of each other and within a certain distance of other specified locations which are incompatible with and would suffer from the secondary effects of adultoriented establishments f based upon its review of materials linking alcohol consumption and highrisk sexual behavior and materials linking alcohol consumption and crimes such as sexual assault the common council finds that a geographic separation of adultoriented establishments from alcohol beverage licensed premises is warranted 2 location of first amendment
