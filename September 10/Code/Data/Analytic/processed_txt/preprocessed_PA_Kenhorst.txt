findings the governing body of the municipality finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including minimization of impacts of development redevelopment and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed poses a threat to surface and groundwater quality e stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality f impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality groundwater recharge stream base flow and aquatic ecosystems the most costeffective and environmentally advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is project design minimizing impervious surfaces and sprawl avoiding sensitive  3981 general provisions  3982   3983 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health safety and welfare within the schuylkill river watershed by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime by minimizing the impacts described in  3982 designed to areas ie stream buffers floodplains steep slopes and designing to topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime g public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater h federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes i nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the municipality a promote alternative project designs and layout that minimizes impacts to surface and groundwater b promote nonstructural best management practices bmps c minimize increases in stormwater volume d minimize impervious surfaces e manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at their source by regulating activities that cause these problems f provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and management g utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems h manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source which requires a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes i focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources j maintain existing base flows and

on downstream stream bank erosion  39814 general provisions  39815   39816 stormwater management districts the primary requirement is to design a bmp to detain the proposed conditions twoyear twentyfourhour design storm to the existing conditions oneyear flow using the scs type ii distribution additionally provisions shall be made such as adding a small orifice at the bottom of the outlet structure so that the proposed conditions oneyear storm takes a minimum of 24 hours to drain from the facility from a point where the maximum volume of water from the oneyear storm is captured ie the maximum water surface elevation is achieved in the facility release of water can begin at the start of the storm ie the invert of the water quality orifice is at the invert of the facility b the minimum orifice size in the outlet structure to the bmp shall be a threeinch diameter orifice and a trash rack shall be installed to prevent clogging on sites with small contributing drainage areas to this bmp that do not provide enough runoff volume to allow a twentyfourhour attenuation with the threeinch orifice the calculations shall be submitted showing this condition orifice sizes less than three inches can be utilized provided that the design will prevent clogging of the intake c in no detention areas district c only see  39816 the objective is not to attenuate the storms greater than the twoyear recurrence interval this can be accomplished by configuring the outlet structure not to control the larger storms or by a bypass channel that diverts only the twoyear stormwater runoff into the basin or conversely diverts flows in excess of the twoyear storm away from the basin a the schuylkill river watershed has been divided into stormwater management districts as shown on the

the ratio of the proposed development site acreage to the total watershed acreage to the downstream conveyance system therefore if the proposed development site is 10% of the total watershed area the increase in 137 editors note appendix d is included as an attachment to this chapter  39815 kenhorst code  39816  runoff may only use up 10% of the documented available downstream capacity at peak

district criteria for which the discharge is located as indicated in this section the calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by subarea an exception to the above may be granted if discharges from multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the discharge site in this case peak discharge in any direction shall follow management district

subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff rates however onsite drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey offsite flows development site f site areas where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity differs significantly from the total site area only the proposed impact area utilizing stormwater management measures shall be subject

proposed development site not located in a provisional direct discharge district the applicant has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control including no detention if the applicant can prove that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the stormwater management plan the no harm option is used when an applicant can prove that the proposed

runoff controls which would generate increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would by definition be precluded from successful attempts to prove no harm except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with  39816h 6 a financial distress shall not constitute grounds for the municipality to approve the use of the noharm option 7 capacity

towers and antennas general references zoning  see ch 475  4241 purpose a the purpose of this chapter is to establish general guidelines for the setting of communications towers and antennas the goals of this chapter are to 1 protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas 2 encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas 3 minimize the total number of towers throughout the community 4 strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary option rather than the construction of additional singleuse towers 5 encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them to the extent possible in areas where the adverse impact of the community is minimal 6 encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of towers and antennas design setting landscape screening and innovative camouflage techniques 7 enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly effectively and efficiently 8 consider the public safety of communications towers 9 minimize potential damage of adjacent properties from
