solid waste ch 36 purpose and policy this division sets forth the policy for accepting vehicle transported wastes into the citys wastewater system  background a the citys wastewater system has made it a practice for many years not to accept any hauled waste under any condition such wastes have been viewed as potential threats to the treatment plant inclusion of toxic hazardous or other undesirable constituents additionally to provide the degree of control necessary to properly screen and monitor such wastes would require extensive preliminary sampling and laboratory analysis review of load manifests and trip tickets and a complete recordkeeping system lastly once wastes are accepted into the system they and any environmental problems they may cause become the responsibility of the citys wastewater system b requests have come from septic haulers public institutions private industrial waste haulers and private industrial and commercial firms each request would require a significant amount of time for proper evaluation prior to acceptance or rejection requests by waste generators are made for one reason only to reduce their costs of disposal and thus the costs of doing business further the city has had a well documented policy of not accepting additional waste from outside the city except in the case of waste from specified service districts ie the state department of transportations city rest area there is no reason to believe that the policy will change the acceptance of hauled waste from outside the city would constitute a breach of the policy  therefore the policy is designed to handle hauled waste that originates within the city  management a acceptance criteria 1 the city will only accept hauled waste from destinations that originate from within the city the one exception to such policy will be to accept leachate from a type ii landfill that accepts the solid waste from the citys contracted waste haulers ie northern oaks recycling and disposal facility 2 the city will accept hauled waste by permitted waste haulers only any person wishing to discharge any material into the citys sanitary system via truck will be required to obtain a permit application from the citys water and waste department at 11175 south eberhart road the permit will be issued for one specific class or type of waste only 3 the hauled waste permit will be issued for a maximum period of one year there will be a permit fee as set by resolution of the city commission from time to time 4 applicants will be notified within 30 days as to acceptance or rejection of the permit b administration to ensure that the integrity of the wastewater treatment plant is maintained and that a complete record of each waste load is available the following requirements must be met prior to the acceptance of each load 1 the only site approved for waste hauler discharge will be located at 812 cedar street the site of the former city wastewater treatment plant such site is access controlled for this reason prior notification of truck arrival must be made or schedules supplied any discharge to the sanitary sewer system other than the approved site will constitute a violation of this chapter the discharge site will be open only during normal working hours that the plant is staffed any afterhours request will be assessed an additional fee based on the actual costs involved 2 any hauled waste discharger will be required prior to discharge into the plant to submit a copy of the load manifest to the wastewater treatment plant superintendent or his appointed representative the load manifest shall contain the following information a origin of waste b waste haulers name address etc c date and time of pickup and date and time of discharge offloading at the wastewater treatment plant d volume of waste e a certification statement that the waste is not a resource conservation and recovery act hazardous waste or a prohibited discharge the certification statement must be signed before any discharge will be allowed and must be signed by the waste hauler and the generator of the waste 3 the manifest shall be completed in triplicate with one copy for the waste hauler one copy for the wastewater treatment plant and one copy for the utilities billing clerk c inspection sampling and load analysis 1 the city shall have the right to collect samples of the waste for analysis at any time the purpose of the analysis shall be for billing surcharges and compliance monitoring an analysis cost shall be paid by the generator of the waste 2 the city shall maintain the right to deny or limit the discharge of any truckedin material the city shall also have the right to request load analysis before accepting any material from an unknown source 3 because truckedin waste must meet the requirements of the general pretreatment regulations it is necessary for the generator located outside the citys legal jurisdiction to consent to inspections and samplings of the generators facilities according to the limitations of section 46199 d compliance with industrial pretreatment waste hauler discharges fall within the scope of the general pretreatment regulations 40

downtown development district design development standards intent the intent of these development design standards is to establish a regulatory zoning tool for an effective facade improvement program that will create selfsustaining selffunded and long lasting benefit to the community of clare specifically the downtown development district the general goals of the development facade standards are stated below 1 goals the four primary goals of the design standards are as follows a improve appearance the goal is to encourage commercial property owners to improve the exterior appearance of their properties in a cost effective affordable manner b encourage development the goal is to encourage development and renovation within downtown clare c preserve history the goal is to preserve historical structures and streetscape in the downtown development district d promote civic pride the goal is to promote civic pride in the beauty of the city 2 objectives the goals stated above can be achieved by following certain principals or objectives the principals or objectives are described below with specific improvement examples that are strongly encouraged by these design standards a maintain a unified historic appearance illconceived additions that detract from the buildings original style shall be removed if a building has historic character the intent shall be to reveal the buildings original form materials and style an example of this type of improvement would be to remove plywood covering transom or storefront display windows b preserve historic features historic preservation is a goal of the clare community for the downtown development district significant historic features and attractive elements whether historic or otherwise shall be preserved and restored if needed for example if there is a decorative iron cornice with a piece missing then every effort shall be made to replace the missing piece and to preserve the original cornice c increase visibility storefronts shall be made of clear transparent glass so that the inside of the store is visible for example dark tinted opaque glass shall be replaced with clear glass and solid coverings over existing windows shall be removed these changes will project a feeling of comfort for the potential customer and will create a more attractive brighter commercial or retail space d use high quality materials high quality building materials such as stone and brick shall be used whenever possible as they project importance integrity and substance typically the cost of the high quality building materials is greater initially but the materials will last a great deal longer than cheaper materials and there will be a substantial savings in the long term for example use stone or brick rather than fake plaster efis or concrete block use real wood rather than plastic wood or chip board e incorporate rich architectural details the buildings shall include historical details to help give the architecture human scale f use historically accurate colors the building faces or facades shall be beautiful with balanced features and attractive colors that are compatible and historically accurate the application of too many colors on one building face may not be historically accurate or appealing g install tasteful lighting storefront lighting shall highlight the attractive architectural features of the building and be adequate for the customer to feel safe the use of tasteful building lights that gently cast light on the wall is preferable to the flashing or bright floodlight approach h relate to surrounding buildings buildings whether old or new shall relate to the existing buildings on the street in form and proportion the buildings shall be set on the zero lot line close to the street and shall be in proportion to the height of adjacent buildings where possible to create a continuous street corridor to illustrate a very tall building shall not be built next to a single story building i maintain human scale the downtown buildings are to be a twostory minimum height but not to exceed four stories in order for the downtown to have a comfortable scale that people can relate to see illustration 52275 illustration 52275 j present an inviting building entryway entrances shall distinguish a building front by creating interest for the potential customer in the proper context of the historical design building entryways were historically recessed and often protected with an awning to provide some shelter from the elements k use original proportions the renovated storefronts shall fit into the existing original opening to illustrate an existing historical building storefront if expanded shall keep the existing storefront in place and simply add another second duplicate building storefront so it looks like there are now two building storefronts rather than one giant one likewise replacement windows shall respect the original historic window opening sizes l create attractive window displays window displays shall be attractive and interesting to customers to encourage the shopper to come inside the business shall place its most interesting products in the window in an artistic manner that makes the customer stop and then venture inside these window displays also tell potential customers what is sold inside window displays shall be rotated on a regular basis to maintain interest m minimize signage too many signs of different styles fonts and wording are confusing to the person walking by the signage shall be simple and shall communicate the business type inside without bombarding the customer with too many words n modify security features security features are important to store owners but these features shall not scare away the customer bars over storefront windows and doors project an image of crime and lack of safety rather than using exterior security gate measures stores shall use security glass andor hidden roll up security gates at the back of the window displays o maintain property broken windows and doors litter and graffiti project an image of poverty and apathy broken windows and doors for instance shall be fixed immediately and graffiti shall be removed from the walls or walks litter shall be removed from the storefront area as soon as it happens to say we care about the community flower displays boxes and planters also help to add warmth color and establish ownership to building fronts  development design standards a purpose the purpose of these standards is to establish clear and
