title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by

culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense when the section neither specified culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense c as used in this section 1 possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed or was aware of his control thereof for a sufficient time to have ended his possession 2 reflexes convulsions body movements during unconsciousness or sleep and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actors

respect to circumstances when because of a substantial lapse from due care he fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the circumstances may exist e when the section defining an offense provides that
