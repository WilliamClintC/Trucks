eleven  planning and zoning thirteen  building s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances the

applies to an industrial users self monitoring the city will still sample a user as is necessary d in making a request for a pollutant monitoring exemption the industrial user must demonstrate other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge or is present only at background levels from intake water without increase in the pollutant due to activities of the user in making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present the user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facilitys process wastewater prior to any treatment

location of such types of landuse activities are many and varied depending upon functional characteristics competitive situations and the availability of land rather than assign all uses to special individual and limited zoning districts it is important to provide controllable and reasonable flexibility in requirements for certain kinds of uses that will allow practicable latitude for the
