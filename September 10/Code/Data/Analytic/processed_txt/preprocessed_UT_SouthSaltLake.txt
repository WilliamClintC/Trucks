system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and

are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of

permit conditions  4 will not result in an accumulation of chemical material in solid sludges that will interfere with the disposal or reuse of the sludge materials  and 5 will not result in higher

disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare of the city 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately flood proofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood damage and loss b statement of purpose it is the purpose of this promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions to specific areas by provisions designed 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding which are generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric
