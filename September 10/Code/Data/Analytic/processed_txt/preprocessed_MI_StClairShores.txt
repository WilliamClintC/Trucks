therefore we expect all employees to treat all equipment with respect being especially mindful of not misplacing small tools and not abusing automobiles see ar #2 rules for operation of cityowned vehicles and large equipment intentional negligence will be met with swift disciplinary action explanation of behavior standards the standards include the latin phrase de minimis in several sections to insure uniform compliance and application the intent of the standard and an explanation of the phrase de minimis is presented below the standards itself is an elaboration of the common sense and ethical behavior which has always been expected of st clair shores employees the standard merely reemphasized the importance of this matter and defines items of concern especially conflicts of interest in drafting the standard care was given to the language so that its prohibitions would not be too broad thereby causing meaningless violations to occur and eventually eliminating its integrity for employees contrariwise the language could not be too specific or limiting because not all situations can be covered either of these two extreme approaches could negate the hopeful intent of the regulations it was therefore determined to draft the standard in general terms and provide for exceptions found necessary by the minor nature of the matter this was accomplished by the insertion of the phrase de minimis in subsections c f and g de minimis originates from the latin phrase de minimis non curat lex translated this becomes the law does not concern itself about trifles

matter is minor the violation was unintentional in nature the act was authorized either as an employee benefit or by specific authorization of a supervisor or the potential for conflict of interest or improper employee personal gain is negligible determination of a de minimis situation will be on a case by case basis and will be the responsibility of supervisory and administrative officials

to screen unsuitable sites and reduce testing costs a soil boring is not required at this stage however a designer or landowner may opt to engage concept design borings at his discretion without feasibility testing initial testing involves either one 1 field test per facility regardless of type or size or previous testing data such as the following  onsite septic percolation testing within two hundred 200 feet of the proposed bmp location and on the same contour which can establish initial rate water table andor depth to bedrock  geotechnical report on the site prepared by a qualified geotechnical consultant or  natural resources conservation service nrcs county soil mapping showing an unsuitable soil group such as a hydrologic group d soil in a lowlying area if the results of

over time due to soil bed consolidation or the accumulation of sediments removed from the treated stormwater a factor of safety of two 2 shall be applied to the tested permeability rate to determine the design permeability rate therefore if the tested permeability rate of the soil bed material is four 4 incheshour the design rate would be two 2 incheshour ie four 4 inches per hourtwo2 this design

permeability rate of the soil bed material must be sufficient to drain the stormwater quality design storm runoff volume within seventytwo 72 hours filter fabric should be placed along the sides of the planting soil bed to prevent the migration of soil particles from the adjacent soil into the planting soil bed d vegetation the vegetation in a bioretention system removes some of the nutrients and other pollutants in the stormwater inflow the use of native plant material is recommended for bioretention systems wherever possible the goal of the planting plan should be to simulate a forestshrub community of primarily upland type in general trees should dominate the perimeter zone that is subject to less frequent inundation shrubs and herbaceous species that are adapted to moister

applicable local state and federal waste regulations 2 vegetated areas mowing andor trimming of vegetation must be performed on a regular schedule based on city code enforcement standards vegetated areas must be inspected at least annually for erosion and scour vegetated areas should also be inspected at least annually for unwanted growth which should be removed with minimum disruption to the planting soil bed and remaining vegetation when establishing or restoring vegetation biweekly inspections of vegetation health should be performed during the first growing season or until the

inspected for cracking subsidence spalling erosion and deterioration at least annually   infiltration an infiltration structure is a facility constructed within highly permeable soils that provides temporary storage of stormwater runoff an infiltration structure does not normally have a structural outlet to discharge runoff from the stormwater quality design storm instead outflow from an infiltration structure is surrounding soil an infiltration structure may also be combined with an extended detention structure to provide additional runoff storage for both stormwater quality and quantity management the adopted tss removal rate for infiltration structures is eighty 80 percent infiltration structures are used to remove pollutants and to infiltrate stormwater back into the ground such infiltration also helps to reduce increases in both the peak rate and total volume of runoff caused by land development pollutant removal is achieved of the runoff soil as well as biological and chemical activity within the soil   predesign site evaluation infiltration structures can present some practical design problems when planning for an infiltration structure that provides stormwater quality treatment consideration should be given to soil characteristics depth to the groundwater table sensitivity of the region and runoff water quality specifically infiltration structures must not be used in the following locations  industrial and commercial areas where solvents andor petroleum products are loaded unloaded stored or applied or pesticides are loaded unloaded or stored  areas where hazardous materials are expected to be present in greater than reportable quantities as defined by the us environmental protection agency in the federal regulations at 40 cfr 3024  areas where infiltration structure use would be inconsistent with an njdepapproved remedial action work plan or landfill closure plan  areas with high risks for spills of toxic materials such as gas stations and vehicle maintenance facilities  areas where industrial stormwater runoff is exposed to source material source material means any materials or machinery located at an industrial facility that is directly or indirectly related to process manufacturing or other industrial activities that could be a source of pollutants in any industrial stormwater discharge to groundwater source materials include but are not limited to raw materials intermediate products final products waste materials byproducts industrial machinery and fuels and lubricants solvents and detergents that are related to process manufacturing or other industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater  areas where their installation would create a significant risk for basement seepage or flooding cause surficial flooding of groundwater or interfere with the operation of subsurface sewage disposal systems and other subsurface structures such adverse impacts must be assessed and avoided by the design engineer infiltration structures must be configured and located where their construction will not compact the soils below the structure in addition an infiltration structure must not be placed into operation until the contributing drainage area is completely stabilized minimal setback requirements for infiltration structures soil absorption systems for septic 50 feet  private wells 100 feet  public wells 150 feet  public reservoir surface water sources for public water systems and their tributaries 400 feet  other surface waters 50 feet  property lines 10 feet  building foundations >10 to 100 feet  depending upon soil types and infiltration structure type soils are perhaps the most important consideration for site suitability in general county soil surveys can be used to obtain necessary soil data for the planning and preliminary design of infiltration structures for final design and construction soil tests are required at the exact location of a proposed structure in order to confirm its ability to function without failure tests should include  determination of the textural classification  permeability of the subgrade soil at and below the bottom of the proposed infiltration structure the recommended minimum depth for subgrade soil analysis is five 5 feet below the bottom of the structure or to the groundwater table soil permeability testing can be conducted in accordance with the standards for individual subsurface sewage disposal systems   design criteria a storage volume depth and duration an infiltration structure must be designed to treat the total runoff volume generated by the structures maximum design storm this may either be the groundwater recharge or stormwater quality design storm depending upon the structures proposed use an infiltration structure must also fully drain this runoff volume within seventytwo 72 hours runoff storage for greater times can render the structure ineffective and may result in anaerobic conditions odor and both water quality and mosquito breeding problems the bottom of the infiltration structure must be at least two 2 feet above seasonal high water table or bedrock for surface structures this distance must be measured from the bottom of the sand layer the structure bottom must be as level as possible to uniformly distribute runoff infiltration over the subgrade soils to enhance safety by minimizing standing water depths the vertical distance between the structure bottom and the maximum design storm water surface in surface infiltration structures should be no greater than two 2 feet construction of an infiltration structure must be done without compacting the structures subgrade soils excavation must be performed by equipment placed outside the structure whenever possible this requirement should be considered when designing the dimensions and total storage volume of an infiltration structure it is important to note that the use of infiltration structures is recommended only for the stormwater quality design storm and smaller storm events use of infiltration structures for larger storm events and the requirements by which such structures are to be designed constructed and maintained should be reviewed and approved by all applicable reviewing agencies b permeability rates the minimum design permeability rate of the soils below an infiltration structure will depend upon the structures location and maximum design storm the use of infiltration structures for stormwater quality control is feasible only where soil is sufficiently permeable to allow a reasonable rate of infiltration therefore infiltration structures designed for storms greater than the groundwater recharge storm can be constructed only in areas with hydrologic soil group a and b soils maximum design structure location minimum design permeability rate incheshour groundwater recharge subsurface 02 groundwater recharge surface 05 stormwater quality surface and subsurface 05 in addition to the above the design permeability rate of the soil must be sufficient to fully drain the infiltration structures maximum design storm runoff volume within seventytwo 72 hours this design permeability rate must be determined by field testing see bioretention pre design since the actual permeability rate may vary from test results and may also decrease over time due to soil bed consolidation or the accumulation of sediments removed from the treated stormwater a factor of safety of two 2 must be applied to the tested permeability rate to determine the design permeability rate therefore if the tested permeability rate of the soils is four 4 incheshour the design rate would be two 2 incheshour ie four 4 inches per hourtwo 2 this design rate would then be used to compute the structures maximum design storm drain time c bottom sand layer to help ensure maintenance of the design permeability rate over time a sixinch layer of sand must be placed on the bottom of an infiltration structure this sand layer can intercept silt sediment and debris that could otherwise clog the top layer of the soil below the structure the sand layer will also facilitate silt sediment and debris removal from the structure and can be readily restored following removal operations the sand layer must meet the specifications of a mdot class ii sand this must be certified by a certified testing lab d overflows all infiltration structures must be able to convey overflows to downstream drainage systems in a safe and stable manner the capacity of the overflow must be consistent with the remainder of the sites drainage system and sufficient to provide safe stable discharge of stormwater in the event of an overflow e subsurface infiltration structures a subsurface infiltration structure is located entirely below the ground surface it may consist of a vault perforated pipe andor stone bed however due to the greater difficulty in removing silt sediment and debris all runoff to a subsurface infiltration structure must be pretreated this pretreatment must remove eighty 80 percent of the tss in the runoff from the structures maximum design storm f basis of design the design

regulations   detention storage facilities detention storage facilities are designed to detain runoff for a short period of time and then release it to a watercourse where it returns to the hydrologic cycle the objective of detention storage is to regulate the released runoff rate and to reduce the impact on downstream drainage systems detention storage should not be confused with retention storage

19 1993 article m   lock box requirements   purpose this ordinance article is intended to address the difficulties occasioned by a fire department response to an alarm activation in an unoccupied building and the need to enter the building to locate confine control extinguish a fire andor investigate the cause of the fire alarm signal as quickly as possible during the last ten years firefighters in general have experienced an increase in the number of fire suppression systems and fire alarm systems installed in both commercial and residential properties and the fact that it is not uncommon for such fire alarm systems to activate when the building is not occupied to gain entry into the building in such situations firefighters must either forcibly enter by breaking a window damaging a door andor locking mechanism or in the alternative open a lock box containing keys to access to the building the st clair shores fire department desires to avoid the inherent problems of forcible entry including but not necessarily limited to damage to exterior doors or windows such that building security is breached additional damage to interior doors to gain access to rooms or areas under investigation and costs and problems associated with securing the building after such forcible entry in contrast thereto the inherent advantages of a lock box system include that the fire department would have immediate access to all necessary rooms and areas to investigate the cause of the fire alarm activation and that once the department has investigated andor corrected the problem the building can once again be secured as it has not been damaged of further great benefit is the fact that such emergency response can occur without the building owneroccupant having to actually appear on site or prior to the building owneroccupant having to actually appear on site or prior to the building owneroccupants having reached the site which may save valuable time in consideration of the above and other important considerations the city of st clair shores ordains that it is in the best interests of the public health safety and welfare to require lock boxes as set forth below ord
