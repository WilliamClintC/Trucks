extension will be based on a point system according to the length of frontage acreage and distance from the origin of the extension to the end point of frontage for properties adjoining the rwoigahfyt where the extension is located or adjoining either side of an alley easement or unpaved road points will be computed as follows l0 points per lineal foot of frontage 500 points per acre of land 01 points per acre per lineal foot of distance from origin of the extension to the end of the properties frontage 01 multiplied by the number of acres mbultipylied the length of the extension the monetary value of each point is obtained by dividing the total number of points for all properties concerned into tel total cost of the line extension less the amount of participation by the city or any other governmental agency and each property is then assessed proportionally by its number of points for properties where adequate water and sewer lines are already available on one side a credit shall be applied as follows reduce the total number of points for the property by fifty percent 50 in the calculations see parcel a in the attached example for schedule i in making the calculations it will be determined in advance which properties the utility extension is designed for and capable of serving each of these parcels of property will then be included in the calculations if it is reasonably certain that a property will never tie on to the system it will be omitted from the calculations any property owner would have to pay a rpartoa share based on the number of points for his property times the same cost per point that was used to calculate the other properties share pg 2 schedule i properties that do not front on the utility extension rwoigahfyt but will be served by the extension are still subject to the rpartoa assessment the number of points are calculated the same way schedule i but the points for the front footage are omitted this is to offset the costs of
