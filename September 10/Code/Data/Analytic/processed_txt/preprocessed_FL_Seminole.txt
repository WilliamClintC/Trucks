complying with the above require design documents that are to be sealed by a professional engineer example 1 when a space has two 10ton systems with each having an independent duct system the

constrained from adding additional capacity a roadway may be physically constrained or policy constrained physical barriers occur when intensive land use development is immediately adjacent to highways making roadway expansion cost prohibitive or when a facility has reached the maximum lane standards policy barriers are based on concerns about the impacts of roadway expansion on the

available to the city or county as is applicable development or development activitysite means the addition to or improvement of property including but not limited to the following activities 1 a

offices or dwelling units in a structure or on land 2 building or installing a new buildingstructure 3 enlarging replacing or substantially restoring a buildingstructure 4 subdividing land into three or more parcels development order means any order granting denying or granting with conditions an application for development development permit means any approved final site plan building permit zoning clearance rezoning special exception variance conditional use or any other official action of the city having the effect of permitting the development of land final local development order means for the purposes of this section that last approval necessary to carry out the development requested level of service los means a measure of performance andor of demand versus available capacity of public services and facilities regarding roadways los is based primarily on travel speeds on a scale of a roads operating at los a are at optimum efficiency with the lower grade roads reflecting travel conditions that are progressively worse for the purposes of this division and the city concurrency management system los reported for roadways is based on peak hour conditions level of service e and f roads andor roads with a volumetocapacity vc ratio of 09 or more are operating below the adopted level of service standard established in the city or county comprehensive plan and the concurrency test statement as is applicable level of service a represents free flow individual users are virtually unaffected by the presence of others in the traffic stream freedom to select desired speeds and to maneuver within the traffic stream is extremely high the general level of comfort and convenience provided to the motorist passenger or pedestrian is excellent level of service b is in the range of stable flow but the presence of other users in the traffic stream begins to be noticeable freedom to select desired speeds is relatively unaffected but there is a slight decline in the freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream from los a the level of comfort and convenience provided is somewhat less than at los a because the presence of others in the traffic stream begins to affect individual behavior level of service c is in the range of stable flow but marks the beginning of the range of flow in which operation of individual users becomes significantly affected by interactions with others in the traffic stream the selection of speed is now affected by the presence of others and maneuvering within the traffic stream requires substantial vigilance on the part of the user the general level of comfort and convenience declines noticeably at this level level of service d represents highdensity but stable flow speed and freedom to maneuver are severely restricted and the driver or pedestrian experiences a generally poor level of comfort and convenience small increases in traffic flow will generally cause operational problems at this level level of service e represents operating conditions at or near the capacity level all speeds are reduced to a low but relatively uniform value freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream is extremely difficult and it is generally accomplished by forcing a vehicle or pedestrian to give way to accommodate such maneuvers comfort and convenience levels are extremely poor and driver or pedestrian frustration is generally high operations at this level are usually unstable because even small increases in flow or minor perturbations within the traffic stream will cause breakdowns level of service f is used to define forced or breakdown flow this condition exists wherever the amount of traffic approaching a point exceeds the amount which can traverse it and queues begin to form operations within the queue are characterized by stopping and starting over and over vehicles progress at reasonable speeds for several hundred feet or more then are required to stop level of service f is used to describe operating conditions within the queue as well as the point of the breakdown it should be noted however that in many cases once free of the queue traffic may resume to normal conditions quite rapidly multimodal impact fee districts means areas identified by pinellas county from which impact fee monies are collected and expended pinellas county mobility management system means the countys process of implementing the pinellas county mobility plan management of transportation impacts of development projects on county facilities assessment collection and expenditure of multimodal impact fees

management approach that uses a set of hydrologic controls structural and nonstructural distributed throughout the site and integrated as a treatment train ie in series to replicate the natural hydrologic functioning of the landscape unlike conventional systems which typically control and treat runoff using a single engineered stormwater pond located at the bottom of the hill lid systems are designed to promote volume attenuation and treatment at or near the source of stormwater runoff via distributed retention detention biofiltration treatment and harvesting mechanisms the fundamental goal of applying lid concepts design and practice is to improve the overall effectiveness and efficiency of stormwater management relative to conventional systems reducing total and peak runoff volumes and improving the quality of waters discharged from the site lid systems are designed primarily for addressing stormwater quality and will provide some attenuation of peak flows  however they may not provide sufficient storage capacity to meet swfwmd water quantity control criteria b the utilization of lid techniques or in combination with traditional stormwater systems as approved by the

developments on less than five acres on a casebycase basis c lid techniques include but are not limited to the following 1 biofiltrationbiofiltration retention biofiltration areas are shallow depressions used as structural stormwater controls to capture treat and infiltrate stormwater runoff biofiltration retention systems are also shallow depressions which utilize underdrains as structural stormwater controls to capture and treat stormwater runoff and connect to an outfall such as a stormwater pond or roadway within the biofiltration area nutrientadsorption media soils mulch and planted vegetation facilitate treatment and remove pollutants from the runoff multiple biofiltration or biofiltration retention areas are often distributed throughout a larger catchment providing numerous treatment and water storage areas although any one treatment area may be small the cumulative effect can be significant 2 dry wells a dry well consists of a small excavated pit backfilled with aggregate usually pea gravel or stone dry wells function as infiltration systems used to control runoff from building rooftops another special application of dry wells is modified catch basins where inflow is a form of direct surface runoff dry wells provide the majority of treatment by processes related to soil infiltration including adsorption trapping filtering and bacterial degradation 3 parking lotsidewalk pervious pavement pervious pavement or pavers also commonly referred to as permeable pavement and porous pavement systems are structural stormwater controls that capture and temporarily store part or all of the water quality volume pervious pavement systems infiltrate and capture rainfall that falls on the surface at rates up to the surface infiltration rate compared to impervious pavements where almost all direct rainfall becomes runoff these systems infiltrate water below the surface where water is typically allowed to exfiltrate into the surrounding parent soil under these circumstances pervious pavement systems function as retention systems pervious pavement systems should be considered as part of a treatment system with credit based on available storage volume and the ability of the system to readily recover the storage volume 4 stormwater harvesting it is a combination of a specified harvesting volume and rate of use intended to achieve yearly
