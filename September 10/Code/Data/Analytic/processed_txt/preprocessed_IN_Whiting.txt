deteriorations as are observed in foundations in many instances the exterior wall exhibits diagonal cracking in addition to vertical and horizontal cracking such cracks generally are not confined to mortar joints themselves but tend to pass primary wall material as well as lintels over openings in the wall lack of watertightness or inadequate ventilation can cause rotting of sills toeplates etc an additional item of deterioration in masonry materials and concrete is the extensive chipping flaking crumbling and erosion of primary exterior wall material such deterioration in the exterior wall will lead to deterioration of the core of the wall which may result in failure of the wall if not corrected 2 exterior frame wall in wood walls lack of corner bracing disposal or ridged sheathing or firestops as well as the separation of joints or crushing of the ends of framing members can cause failure of the wall the entrance of moisture can cause rot which in turn can lead to failure of the wall for example rotting of toeplates sills studs bracing etc 3 examples of critical and major loadbearing wall defects include i walls which are severely out of plumb ii severe sagging over a large

life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and

flood damages c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction 3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters 4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 6 make

license to enjoy the full benefits of an fcc license or right or in the event the property owner or licensed holder believes alternatives exist that are less burdensome to adjacent property owners the owner or licensee contact the zoning administrator for a waiver from these provisions the zoning administrator may grant such a waiver upon findings that either 1 actual compliance with the existing provisions of the citys zoning prevent the large satellite television dish from receiving a usable satellite signal or prevent an individual from exercising the rights granted to him or her by the

administrator shall attempt to balance the impact of the tower on the views of adjacent properties as well as the impacts of alternative screening and relocation in order to equitably distribute any

process shall be interactive in which the zoning administrator works with the licensee to craft conditions that place the minimum burden on adjacent property owners while permitting the owner of the large satellite television dish or holder of an amateur radio license to exercise the rights which he or she has been granted by federal law for example the number of antennas and size of the array shall be no greater than that necessary to enjoy full use of the fcc license conditions may include but are not limited to requirements for screening and landscaping review of the color reflectivity and mass of the proposed satellite television antenna or amateur radio facilities and other reasonable restrictions consistent with the intent of the city council that a waiver be granted only when necessary to permit the satellite television antenna to acquire usable satellite signal or to allow the licensee to exercise the rights granted by federal communication commission license while preserving the aesthetic harmony of the community the process employed should involve the interaction of the licensee or owner and the neighborhood certain issues have been preempted by federal law and shall not be considered by the zoning administrator such issues include but are not limited to the impacts of electromagnetic radiation the potential interference of the amateur radio facility with electronic devices in the neighborhood and any other matter preempted by federal law or regulation impact on view and on the values of neighboring properties may be considered in imposing reasonable conditions but shall not be a basis for denial of a permit to construct the antenna 5 the application fee and notification for consideration of the waiver by an owner of a satellite
