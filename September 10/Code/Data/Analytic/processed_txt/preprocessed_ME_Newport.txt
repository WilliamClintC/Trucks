follows a there shall be no cleared opening greater than 250 square feet in the forest canopy or other existing woody vegetation if a forested canopy is not present as measured from the outer limits of the tree or shrub crown however a footpath not to exceed six 6 feet in width as measured between tree trunks and  or shrub stems is allowed provided that a cleared line of sight to the water buffer strip is not created b selective cutting of trees within the buffer strip is allowed provided that a well distributed stand of trees and other natural vegetation is maintained for the purposed of this section a welldistributed stand of trees  adjacent to a great pond or a river or stream flowing to a great pond shall be defined as maintaining a rating scored of 12 or more in any 25 foot by 25foot

adjacent to other water bodies tributary streams and wetlands a welldistributed stand of trees is defined as maintaining a minimum rating score of 8 per 25foot by 25 foot square area note as an example adjacent to a great pond if a 25foot x 25foot plot contains three 3 trees between 2 and 4 inches in diameter three trees between 4 and 12 inches in diameter and three trees over 12 inches in diameter the rating score is 3x1 + 3x2 + 3x4   21 points thus the 25foot by 25foot plot contains trees worth 21 points trees totaling 9 points 2112   9 may be removed from the plot provided that no

diameter measured at 4 12 feet above the ground level may be removed in any ten 10 year period c in order to protect water quality and wildlife habitat existing vegetation under three 3 feet in height and other ground cover including leaf litter and the forest duff layer shall not be cut covered or removed except to provide for a footpath or other permitted uses as described in p paragraphs 2 and 2a above d pruning of tree branches on the bottom 13 of the tree is allowed e in order in maintain a buffer strip of vegetation when the removal of stormdamaged diseased unsafe or dead trees results in the creation of cleared openings these openings shall be replanted with native trees species unless existing new tree growth is present the provisions contained in p2 does not apply to those portions of public recreational facilities adjacent to public swimming areas as long as cleared areas are limited to the minimum areas necessary 3 at distances greater than one hundred 100 feet horizontal distance from a great pond or a river and seventyfive 75 feet horizontal distance from the normal highwater line of any other water body tributary stream or the upland 28 edge of a wetland there shall be allowed on any lot in any ten 10 year period selective cutting of not more than forty 40 percent of the volume of trees four 4 inches or more in diameter measured 4 12 feet above ground level tree removal in conjunction with the development of permitted uses shall be included in the forty 40 percent calculation for the purpose of these standards volume may be considered to be
