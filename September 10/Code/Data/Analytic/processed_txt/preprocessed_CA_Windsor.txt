ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will

home regulations chapter 1  rent stabilization findings and purpose  definitions 81100  findings and purpose a in 1985 the sonoma county town council recognized that a serious problem of rapidly increasing mobile home park space rents existed in the unincorporated areas of sonoma county in 1986 the board retained an experienced consultant connerly & associates inc to conduct a market survey of mobile home parks and mobile home park residents in the county b in january 198 connerly and associates inc submitted to the board a written report detailing their findings which were as follows 1 the majority of mobile homes in the county are located in rented spaces in mobile home parks 2 in the unincorporated area of the county there are seventyfive 75 mobile home parks containing three thousand six hundred fiftynine 3659 spaces in 1986 3 mobile homes in mobile home parks provide an important alternative form of housing for a substantial number of county residents 4 the majority of mobile home park residents are age sixtyfive 65 or older 5 the median income of mobile home park residents in unincorporated county areas is fourteen thousand $1400000 dollars per year which is defined by the us department of housing and urban development as lower income in 1986 6 in the unincorporated county areas about fortythree 43% percent of mobile home park residents are defined as very low income recipients according to the hud definition of that term in 1986 7 seventy 70% percent of mobile home park resident households have at least one 1 retired member whose primary source of income is social security payments 8 during the past three 3 years median mobile home park space rents have increased by eighteen point one 181% percent 9 a majority of mobile home park residents in the county pay more than twentyfive 25% percent of their income for housing 10 a large majority of mobile home park residents own the mobile homes which they occupy and many of these residents have substantial loan payments to meet in addition to rent payments 11 the median estimates sales value of a mobile home in a mobile home park exceeds thirty thousand $3000000 dollars 12 many mobile home park residents were born in sonoma county or have lived in the county for ten 10 years or more 13 the vacancy rate among mobile home park spaces is zero point three 03% percent in 1986 14 the cost of moving a mobile home is in the range of two thousand nine hundred $290000 dollars to four thousand $400000 dollars or more in 1986 c the town council reviewed the above conclusions on  and found them to be true and correct in reviewing a new rent control survey prepared by connerly and associates in early 199 the town council found a profound need for continued mobile home space and in special circumstances recreational vehicle space rent control the town council found the 1992 survey its data and its conclusions to be true and correct and took particular note of the following 1 mobile homes and manufactured housing have represented an affordable form of shelter to millions of californians with modest incomes this has been especially true for elderly persons living on fixed social security or retirement incomes 2 a vacancy rate of one point two 12% percent in 1991 and vacancy rates of typically one 1% percent or less over the past five 5 years have given mobile home park owners a virtual oligopoly where market forces do not influence space rental pricing 3 typical moving costs for mobile homes from one mobile home park to another if vacant spaces could be located range from approximately five thousand $500000 dollars to nine thousand four hundred $940000 dollars depending upon the size of the mobile home 4 the average annual rent increase proposed by park owners between 1987 and 1991 was thirteen point two 132% percent annum pursuant to the rent stabilization ordinance an average less than half 12 the proposed percentage rent increase was authorized during those years 5 persons over sixtyfive 65 comprised over half 12 of the mobile home park population 6 of those survey respondents reporting their level of income fortythree 43% percent were very lowincome fifty 50% percent or less of the median county income and twentyseven 27% percent were lowerincome fifty 50% percent  eighty 80% percent of the median county income 7 few residents reported substantial assets which they could draw upon to meet future housing expenses fewer than half 12 of the respondents had thirty thousand $3000000 dollars or more in assets excluding the value of their mobile homes 8 under the countys voluntary mediation program between 1985 and 198 park owners proposed annual rent increases averaging nine point six 96% percent nearly four 4 times the rate of general price increases according to the cpi for sonoma county after mandatory arbitration was established and the current rent control ordinance adopted requested rent increases were generally twice or more of the approved rent increases approved rent increases on the average began to mirror the cpi 9 the mobile home space rent stabilization program has succeeded in its broad objectives and should be expanded to address additional problem areas 10 the town council found that it would be desirable to include longterm recreational vehicle space tenants in mobile home parks under the rent stabilization program such tenants in mobile home parks appear to be similarly situated to mobile home tenants except for the vehicular character of their dwellings although mobile recreational vehicles in mobile home parks are trapped by the low vacancy rate within mobile home parks transient recreational vehicle parks are not amenable to the type of permanent residency needs of permanent recreational vehicle space tenants 11 the town council found that it would be desirable to provide prospective mobile home park tenants with an option to choose between a longterm lease and a periodic tenancy of less than one 1 year in duration the terms offered under typical longterm leases by some park owners are excessively long oppressive onesided adhesion agreements such an option furthers a legitimate governmental objective and is not in conflict with or preempted by state law 12 the town council found that on average several dozen mobile homes are sold or offered for sale each year in sonoma county the sale of these mobile homes onsite subjects mobile home coach owners to unreasonably suppressed resale rates due to oppressively high rental adjustments upon rent decontrol the town council found that it would be desirable to provide vacancy control in its rent stabilization program as hereunder provided 13 the need for effective and fair mobile home park space rent stabilization continues to exist in sonoma county in 1992 as it did in 1986  81105  additional findings and purpose a based on the aforementioned findings the county of sonoma enacted county as county forms the basis of this section to the extent necessary and appropriate the town council hereby incorporates the consultants study and the countys findings in addition the town council finds the following statistically the mobile home park vacancy rate averages under one 1% percent with a shortage of parks and no new ones being built the cost of moving a mobile home today is exorbitant and averages over six thousand $600000 dollars over fifty 50% percent of the residents are over sixtyfive 65  social security is the primary source of income for over seventy 70% percent and many residents are either single or widowed this is true affordable housing and needs to be preserved there is a great need to prevent excessive space rent increases which could result in threats to health and safety and possible economic eviction b the purpose of this section is to stabilize the rate of mobile home park space rental in order to 1 prevent exploitation of the shortage of vacant mobile home park spaces  2 prevent excessive and unreasonable mobile home park space rent increases  3 rectify the disparity of bargaining power which exists between mobile home park residents and mobile home park owners  4 provide mobile home park owners with a guaranteed rate of annual space rent increase which accurately reflects the rate of inflation and increases in their expenses  5 provide a process for ensuring mobile home park owners a fair just and reasonable rate of return on their parks in cases where the guaranteed annual space rent increase provided by this section proves insufficient  81110

hereby does find and determine that the following local conditions and circumstances exist within the town of windsor and that they make necessary and appropriate the regulations contained within this ordinance a statistically the mobile home park vacancy rate averages under one 1% percent with a shortage of parks and no new ones being built the cost of moving a mobile home today is exorbitant and averages over six thousand $600000 dollars over fifty 50% percent of the residents are over sixtyfive 65social security is the primary source of income for over seventy 70% percent and many residents are either single or widowed this is affordable housing and needs to be preserved there is a great need to prevent excessive space rent increases which could result in threats to health and safety and possible economic eviction b closure of such a park would have a substantial adverse economic effect on these residents when a mobile home in an existing park is sold it is generally sold in place  a mobile home in an existing park is not often moved from its location once it has been placed in a park there are a few vacant spaces in the mobile home parks within the immediate vicinity of the town and the number of vacant spaces in sonoma county is small relocating homeowners in an area in excess of thirty 30 miles from their existing home creates a special hardship particularly for elderly residents who need to be in social service support networks a move in excess of thirty 30 miles would seriously disrupt these support resources would jeopardize the jobs of those residents currently employed and would not constitute adequate replacement housing for such residents c due to the above circumstances spaces in the existing mobile home park in the town represent an important component of the housing stock of the town especially for senior citizens and persons of lowmoderate incomes d unless mitigation measures are undertaken the conversion of mobile home parks to other uses would have a substantial adverse economic effect upon the homeowners and residents in terms of cost of relocation including the significantly higher cost of other types of housing in the immediate area if such homeowners cannot relocate to other mobile home parks mobile home owners often have invested substantial sums in the acquisition installation and maintenance of their mobile homes for most residents these units represent their sole or principal financial asset one result of conversion unless mitigated can be the destruction of the value of the mobile home this destruction of value would be a direct cost of relocation and would adversely affect the homeowners ability to find adequate replacement housing so that it is important to provide reasonable relocation assistance to avoid such an adverse effect e it is the policy of state law as enunciated in government 7 and 664274 that prior to the conversion of a mobile home park to other uses or prior to the closure of a park or the cessation of use of the land as a mobile home park or at the time of filing of a subdivision map for a subdivision resulting from any such conversion the proponent of the proposed change of use must file a report on the impact of such change with the public agency having jurisdiction over the mobile home park and the agency shall have the power to require measures to be undertaken to mitigate the adverse impacts of such conversion upon the ability of displaced residents to find adequate replacement housing  82105  purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to provide for procedures and standards for the conversion closure or cessation of use of a mobile home park so as to implement state law to mitigate the adverse impacts of park closure on the displaced residents ability to find adequate replacement housing taking into account the particular local conditions existing within the town of windsor while providing economically viable and reasonable use of the mobile home park land to park owners this chapter will serve to inform park owners and homeowners of their respective rights and obligations including specific identification of the reasonable costs of relocation so as to

parcels as that on which an existing building or structure is located and to the installation of a new or additional building or structure on the same or on an adjoining parcel of land under the same ownership and to the extension of an existing use to an adjoining parcel of land under the same ownership it is the intent of the town council that the provisions of this chapter shall apply to any land abutting on a street held in the same ownership as other land abutting on that street for which a development permit has been previously granted  part 162300  relinquishment of dedication and improvement or payment in lieu thereof a if the town council shall determine that land dedicated improvements made or money contributed in lieu of improvements under and pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall in any given case no longer be necessary because of a change in street plan lines street plans or improvement requirements and if the town council further determines that it is equitable and reasonable to do so the town council shall be empowered to direct the conveyance by quit claim deed of said dedicated land and improvements and the refund without interest of any money paid in lieu of improvements to the present owner at the time of said conveyance or refund of the land adjoining the dedicated land b the town council finds and determines that said conveyance and refund should be made to the present owner for the following reasons to quit claim to one other than the present owner could leave the present owners adjoining land without access and landlocked  subsequent owners receive the benefit of a prior owners compliance with the provisions of this chapter  and therefore subsequent owners should receive the benefit of any relinquishment by the town  presumably the cost of dedication and improvement is included in the price which the present owner paid to the prior owner  the tracing of title from present owner to prior owner or owners is costly burdensome and time consuming and would often outweigh the value of property conveyed or the refund made the intent of this chapter is that improvements once made run with the land and requirements under this chapter once met need not be repeated on each change of ownership c the town council finds and determines that no interest should be paid on refunds for the following reasons as the town derives no benefit from improvements until they are made the town should be entitled to retain any interest on payments in lieu of improvements to compensate the town for the inability to use the improvements the town has not had the unlimited use of funds paid in lieu of improvements under the provisions of this chapter and therefore should not be required to make payment therefore in the form of interest d as used in this section the phrase land adjoining the dedicated land refers to the land out of which the dedication is made and which adjoins the dedicated land  part 162310  appeal

the planning area to provide an adequate land supply for potential development horizon year the location of the towns urban growth boundary recognizes that certain lands to its west north and east are unsuitable for urbanization due to federal state county and local policies established for the protection of agricultural lands oak woodlands hillsides vernal poolwetland habitat flood zones steep slopes seismic hazards and scenic views development to the south of the sphereofinfluence and urban growth boundary is also constrained by proximity to the charles m schulzsonoma county airport and

protection district and windsor police department provide essential public services for the promotion and protection of the general welfare and safety of windsor residents the town finds that in order to ensure that the provision of these services keeps pace with new development it is necessary to manage increments of growth in accordance with the service provision of the above districts d fiscal resources balance the mix of residential and nonresidential land uses to emphasize economic growth and to ensure that public infrastructure and service costs associated with unmanaged residential growth do not exceed available fiscal resources resulting in decreased public service or maintenance activities or adverse fiscal consequences to the town to the detriment of the public safety and welfare e circulation the town of windsor general plan and its related environmental impact report identify intersections which would be degraded to less than acceptable levels of service with unmitigated buildout of the urban growth boundary in order to ensure adequate capacity of the towns circulation system concurrent with new growth and in conformance with the towns level of service los

grounds that they are hazardous if there is no immediate danger and the structural deficiency can be corrected it should be if the town determines that there was no reasonable basis for believing there was an emergency the property owner may face penalties for violating this health and safety of a tree are two distinct and separate functional characteristics a vigorous and healthy tree may not necessarily be of sound wood or structure to remove a dangerous protected or designated tree it must first be evaluated and the tree determined to be hazardous as defined in this section this must be verified in writing by the town arborist before the tree can be removed a tree hazard responsibility on private property it is the responsibility of the property owner to mitigate or abate a known hazardous condition of a protected or designated tree that may be of questionable structure or deemed as hazardous most tree hazards can be prevented with regular checkups by a tree care professional and timely maintenance action by the property owner 3133 b recognizing tree hazards  criteria and evaluation of hazards determining whether or not a trees defects constitute a condition that presents an imminent hazard to an area requires a high degree of knowledge and experience hazard tree assessment of a protected or designated tree should only be evaluated by an arborist refer to the town of windsor tree technical manual for specific criteria in evaluating tree hazards the manual includes a checklist for evaluation as well as reduction and prevention methods c town liability for public rightofway publicly owned property in the event that a tree on private property is evaluated by an arborist and a report is submitted that indicates that a tree may be a hazard to the public overhang sidewalk buildings pedestrian use area etc but recommends for reasons of health maturity etc that the tree be retained the town may require that risk management review and make a determination on the issue of liability if the tree is determined by the towns risk manager to be a liability maintenance andor removal may be required payment of costs shall be determined by the town manager or hisher

or poor 1 structure are not required to be replaced 1 tree mitigation an approved arborist must determine that a tree designated for preservation in a development project has a good chance at longterm survival as determined by an assessment of proposed development impacts simply preserving a tree does not excuse it from designated mitigation requirements  it must in the professional opinion of the arborist have a good chance to survive after all the impacts of construction are considered a inkind replacement if the location of replacement tree planting will remain as a natural area suitable for the healthy and longterm growth of native trees replacement of protected trees should occur inkind that is a native tree species shall be replaced with the same native tree species if the location of replacement tree planting will be part of an irrigated ornamental landscape area replacement of protected trees may occur with a water tolerant oak tree species as identified by the project arborist

24 boxes are chosen then 12 would be required a total of 48 of replacement trunk may be composed of 648 boxes plus 1224 boxes at the time of replacement equivalent sizes of trunk are required after ten years time it is expected that replacement trunks will yield an equivalent volume of canopy to that which was originally removed even though the equivalent canopy will be spread across a greater number of individual trees this achieves the towns goal of no net loss of protected tree canopy b inlieu replacement in the event that a development site is insufficient in size or use to plant any or
