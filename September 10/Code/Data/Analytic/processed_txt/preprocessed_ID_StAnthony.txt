the design component of an open space subdivision cannot be over emphasized the requirements support creation of a proper balance between density design and open space which respects the site specific topography and natural environment the other important factor is to assure proper long term maintenance of both the built environment and open space components of the subdivision open space may be comprised of two types of land primary open space areas and secondary open space areas primary open space areas the primary open space areas consist of the following and shall be included in the required open space except where these characteristics comprise more area than the percent of required open space wetlands  lands that are generally inundated under ponds lakes creeks etc  land within the one hundred year floodplain or required stream corridor setbacks  slopes exceeding thirtythree percent  soils susceptible to slumping secondary open space areas greater latitude exists in the designation of secondary open space areas secondary open space areas shall include the most sensitive and noteworthy natural scenic and cultural resources on the remaining property and shall typically include all or part of the following kinds of resources moderate to steep slopes particularly those adjoining water courses and ponds where disturbance and resulting soil erosion and sedimentation could be detrimental to water quality agricultural lands including important farmland lands historically used for irrigated and nonirrigated row crops pasture and grazing lands windbreak plantings or orchards healthy woodlands particularly those performing important ecological functions such as soil stabilization and protection of streams wetlands and wildlife habitats hedgerows groups of trees large individual trees standing alone visually prominent topographic features such as knolls hilltops and ridges and scenic viewsheds as seen from public roads particularly those with historic features aquifer recharge areas areas with highly permeable excessively drained soils significant wildlife habitat areas sites or structures identified as having historic archeological or cultural features existing trails connecting the tract to other locations around the city minimum open space although the resource lands listed as primary or secondary conservation areas may comprise more than the required area of open space no applicant shall be required to designate more than twelve percent of open space required  however other standards of this title or other statutes may further limit the development of the remaining land open spaceownership use protection and long term maintenance applicants shall demonstrate compliance with the open space land ownership and maintenance standards of this title ownership open space may be owned and managed individually jointly by an association corporation or trust a municipality a recognized land trust or conservancy or in combination of any of the above condominium association common facilities may be controlled use of condominium agreements such agreements shall be in accordance with relevant idaho state law all open space and common facilities shall be held as common elements homeowner association common facilities may be held in common ownership by a homeowner association subject to all of the provisions for homeowner association set forth in state regulations and statutes in addition the following regulations shall be met the applicant shall provide the city a description of the organization of the proposed association including its bylaws and all documents governing ownership maintenance and use restrictions for common facilities the proposed association shall be established by the owner or applicant and shall be operating with financial subsidization by the owner or applicant if necessary before the sale of any dwelling units in the project fourstep site planning procedures for open space subdivisions fourstep process each sketch plan shall follow a fourstep design process described below when the preliminary plat is submitted applicants shall be prepared to demonstrate to the commission that these four design steps were followed by their site designers in determining the layout of their proposed roads house lots and open space lands applicants shall be prepared to submit four separate sketch overlay maps indicating the findings of each step of the design process with respect to the features identified herein if so requested by the administrator step onedesigning the open space during the first step all potential conservation areas both primary and secondary as described above are identified consider site characteristics of the parcel being subdivided as well as the surrounding land open space subdivision design should be considered from a broad perspective that balances visual impacts impacts to agriculture impacts to environmentally sensitive areas and impact to adjacent property owners to achieve the best possible relationship between development and open space areas the minimum acreage of required open space land shall be submitted as part of the subdivision plan in accordance with this title open space land shall include all primary conservation areas up to the required minimum open space any remaining required open space land consists of secondary conservation areasthose parts of the remaining buildable lands with the highest resource significance proposed open space land shall be designated as a base map and complying with applicable sections of this title dealing with resource conservation and open space delineation standards if the application proposes a zone change the citys preferred land use map in the comprehensive plan shall also be referenced and considered primary conservation areas shall be delineated comprising floodplains wetlands and slopes over thirtythree percent in delineating secondary conservation areas the applicant shall prioritize the natural and cultural resources on the tract in terms of their suitability for inclusion in the proposed open space in consultation with the commission and in accordance with this title on the basis of those priorities and practical considerations given to the projects configuration its relation to resource areas on adjoining and neighboring properties and the applicants subdivision objectives secondary conservation areas shall be delineated to meet at least the minimum area requirements for open space land and in a manner clearly indicating their boundaries as well as the types of resources included within them provide open space that is not divided into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the application to the greatest extent practicable this land shall be designed as a single block with logical straightforward boundaries long thin strips of conservation land shall be avoided unless the conservation feature is linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other streams or trails the open space shall generally abut existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels such as existing conservation easements public parks or public lands such subdivision open space shall be designed as part of larger contiguous and integrated open space systems as these standards are implemented the protected open spaces in each new subdivision should eventually adjoin each other ultimately forming an interconnected network of primary and secondary conservation areas across the community connectivity between adjoining subdivisions is required maintaining historically existing public access to public lands or water resources is also required step twolocation of house sites during the second step potential house sites are tentatively located because the proposed location of houses within each lot represents a significant decision subdivision applicants shall identify tentative house sites on the preliminary plan and proposed house sites on the detailed final plan the majority of homesites should abut undivided open space in order to provide direct views and access safe and convenient access to the open space from all lots not adjoining the open space shall be provided except in the case of farmland or other resource areas vulnerable to trampling damage or human disturbance potential house sites shall be located along the street network at least twentyfive percent of which should be singleloaded meaning that application shall occur on one side only along those segments unless otherwise specified in this title dwelling units shall be set back at least one hundred feet from primary conservation areas and at least ten feet from secondary conservation areas setbacks from conservation areas take into consideration the potential negative impacts of residential application on such areas as well as the potential positive benefits of such locations to provide attractive views and visual settings for the residences if development must be located in open fields or pastures because of greater constraints in all other parts of the site dwellings should be sited on the least productive agricultural soils or in locations that will facilitate the continued agricultural use of the open space or in locations that can be visually buffered from existing public roads such as planting a screen consisting of indigenous native trees shrubs and wildflowers create sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses minimize impacts on large woodlands especially those containing a significant wildlife habitat or those not degraded by invasive weeds also development of areas with native vegetation of any size on highly erodible soils with slopes greater than ten percent should be avoided establish buffer zones and leave scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted particularly along public ways and scenic corridors of rural roads with historic buildings avoid siting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges by taking advantage of lower topographic features step threelayout of streets and squares the third step consists of aligning proposed streets to provide vehicular access to each house in the most reasonable and economical way when lots and access streets are laid out they shall be located in a way that avoids or minimizes adverse impacts to open space areas and adjacent lands to the greatest extent practicable wetland crossings shall be minimized identify the tentative locations of the more formal open space elements such as greens commons squares and parks create a connected street network consistent with other street design standards in this title provide active recreational areas including an interconnected pedestrian circulation system in suitable locations that offer safe convenient access to residents and adequate screening from nearby house lots show schematic locations and types of stormwater management sanitary sewer and water supply systems streets shall be designed to parallel and preserve existing tree lines hedgerows stone walls and watercourses minimize alteration of natural cultural or historic features minimize the acreage devoted to streets calm traffic speeds promote pedestrian movement secure the view to prominent natural vistas be aligned so that the terminal vista is of civic buildings or open space land either manmade greens commons squares parks or natural such as but not limited to meadows large specimen trees and woodlands minimize crossing of primary conservation areas all streets with the exception of loop streets and loop lanes shall terminate at other streets within the project and at least two streets shall provide connections to existing or proposed streets or collectors outside the project wherever practicable and as required by this title loop lanes shall be designed with a central median running their entire length bounded on each side by a oneway lane not less than fourteen feet in paved width the median shall be at least thirty feet wide and shall be planted with shade trees along both sides at intervals not less than twentyfive feet step fourlot lines the fourth step is simply to draw in the lot lines and where applicable the building envelopes other design considerations the configuration of open space land shall comply with the following standards except for civic and recreational spaces such as squares and playing fields open space land shall be free of all structures excluding however historic buildings stone walls and structures related to open space land uses the city may grant approval of structures and improvements required for storm drainage sewage treatment and water supply within the open space land provided that such facilities are not detrimental to the open space acreage for such uses shall not be credited towards minimum open space unless the land is appropriate for passive recreational use except for formal greens commons squares parks playing fields and trail corridors open space land should not have a lengthtowidth ratio of less than  or be less than seventyfive feet in width open space land shall adjoin the largest practicable number of lots within the application nonadjoining lots shall be provided with safe and convenient pedestrian access to open space land open space land designated for active recreational uses shall not negatively impact adjacent dwelling units parking driveways and roads open space land shall be interconnected wherever possible to provide a continuous network of such lands within and adjoining the city open space land shall provide buffers to adjoining parks preserves or other protected lands except in those cases where part of the open space is located on private house lots or agricultural use open space land shall provide for pedestrian pathways for use by the residents of the subdivision consideration shall be given to providing for public access on such trails if they are linked to other publicly accessible pathway systems within the county provisions should be made for access to the open space land as required for land management and emergency purposes open space land shall be undivided by public or private streets except where necessary for proper traffic circulation open space land shall be suitably maintained either by retaining existing natural cover and wooded areas continuing agricultural use andor according to a landscaping plan to protect and

the safety of aircraft pilots and passengers and protect a substantial investment of public funds by assuring that land application and construction activities within the aozd are compatible with the safe continued use of the airports serving fremont county  2262015  height limitation zones the aozd is composed of several height limitation zones which include all land lying beneath the approach surfaces transitional surfaces horizontal surfaces and conical surfaces appurtenant to stanford field and the henrys lake airfield these zones are shown on supplements to the official zoning map of the city an area located in more than one of these zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation utility runway visual approach zone the inner edge of the approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is two hundred fifty feet wide the approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of one thousand two hundred fifty feet at a horizontal distance of five thousand feet from the primary surface its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway transitional zones the transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces horizontal zone the horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of five thousand feet from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs the horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones conical zone the conical zone is the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there from a horizontal distance of four thousand feet  2262015  height limitations no structure or tree shall be allowed to exceed the height limitations established here utility runway visual approach zone slopes twenty feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of five thousand feet along the extended runway centerline transitional zones slope seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface and extending to a height of one hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation in addition there are transitional sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface and extending to where they intersect the conical surface horizontal zone one hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation conical zone slopes twenty feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the edge of the horizontal zone and at one hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of three hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation exception from height limitations nothing in this title shall prohibit the construction or maintenance of any structure of thirty feet or less in height or the growth of any tree to a height up to thirty feet above the surface of the land within the horizontal and conical zones  2262015  use restrictions no use within any zone established by this chapter shall create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport create bird strike hazards or in any way endanger or interfere with the operation of aircraft  2262015  permits  additional requirements permit requirements for all application activity are established in samc within the aozd permit requirements shall be expanded to include the planting of any tree with a growth habit of more than thirty feet and the construction of any building or structure that is more than thirty feet in height and is exempted from the requirement for a permit this includes agricultural outbuildings and similar accessory structures except as follows within the horizontal and conical zones no permit shall be required for trees with a growth habit of less than thirty feet or for exempt structures of less than thirty feet in height except when because of topographic features such a tree or structure would extend above the height limits for those zones  within the approach zones but at a horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred feet from each end of the runway no permit shall be required for trees with a growth habit of less than thirty feet or for exempt structures of less than thirty feet in height except when because of topographic features such a tree or structure would extend above the height limits for those zones  and in the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones but beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone no permit shall be required for trees with a growth habit of less than thirty feet or for exempt structures of less than thirty feet in height except when because of topographic features such a tree or structure would extend above the height limits for those zones  2262015  variances  additional requirements the variance procedure is described in any application for a variance of the height limitations established in this chapter shall be accompanied by a determination from the federal aviation administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe efficient use of navigable airspace  2262015  nonconforming uses  additional requirements nonconforming uses and buildings are regulated by these provisions within the aozd according to these requirements in addition to those of samc nonconforming uses within the aozd may include trees and shall be required to permit the installation operation and maintenance of any markers andor lights the city or airport board deems necessary to indicate their presence to the operators of aircraft such markers and lights shall be installed operated and maintained at the expense of the city or airport board the repair and under specified circumstances replacement of nonconforming uses and buildings permitted by this title including any building or tree shall not be permitted to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter was derived  2262015  obstruction marking and lighting the approval of any application for a permit or variance may be conditioned on the installation operation and maintenance at the owners expense of the markings andor lights necessary to indicate the presence of an obstruction to aircraft pilots  2262015
