types of resources this chapter divides them into two groups according to their importance to the public health safety and general welfare cthe city intends to avoid the financial and planning crises

have on city resources these procedures are designed to alert the city to resource problems the city shall use this information to ensure adequate services and resources for the entire community as well as for new development insofar as the city is capable of doing so the city has the responsibility to alleviate resource problems and provide the services necessary for new development when doing

develop and maintain uptodate information on the capabilities of its basic resources cstandards and policies 1the council shall adopt by resolution standards and policies for determining the capacity and current status of city resources these standards will be used by city departments to determine whether a resource is overburdened or would be overburdened if a development project were allowed

proposal a notice of the hearing must be published at least ten days before the hearing 3the absence of any particular standard or policy shall not in itself be sufficient reason to deny a permit

safety and general welfare and meet the intent of this chapter unless findings to the contrary are made a level 2 deficiency may not be a reason for withholding or delaying approval of a project 2in the case of level 2 problems the authority which determines appropriate measures to mitigate the problem must also find that these measures adequately protect the publics health safety and general

and the surrounding areas a shortage of spaces for the location of mobile homes because of this shortage there is a very low vacancy rate and rents have been for several years and are presently rising rapidly and causing concern among a substantial number of san luis obispo residents bmobile home tenants forced by the lack of suitable alternative housing have had to pay the rent increases and thereby suffer a further reduction in their standard of living cbecause of the high cost and impracticability of moving mobile homes the potential for damage resulting therefrom the requirements relating to the installation of mobile homes including permits landscaping and site preparation the lack of alternative homesites for mobile home residents and the substantial investment of mobile home owners in such homes this council finds and declares it necessary to protect the owners and occupiers of mobile homes from unreasonable rent increases while at the same time recognizing the need of park owners to receive a suitable profit on their property with rental income sufficient to cover increases in costs of repair maintenance insurance utilities employee services additional amenities and other costs of operation and to receive a fair return on their property dthis council finds that the present low vacancy rate and frequent increases are particularly hard upon and unfair to residents of mobile home parks within the city large numbers of these residents are senior citizens and others on fixed incomes who installed their mobile homes in the city when the present inflationary rent increases could not reasonably have been foreseen etenants in mobile home parks desiring to sell their mobile homes may have difficulty finding buyers because upon a change of ownership the park owner is able to raise the rent without regard to the citys mobile home rent stabilization ordinance fthis council finds that it is in the best interests of the citizens of the city of san luis obispo to assist those who are seeking to sell their mobile homes and those who are seeking to buy such homes to have the same fair rental protection as is afforded to those who remain in their mobile homes without sale this council finds that the vacancy control provisions originally included in the mobile home rent stabilization ordinance when it was approved by the voters was an effective and beneficial provision for the people of san luis obispo living in mobile home parks and should be reinstated this council further finds that provisions allowing annual rent increases together with provisions allowing rent increases upon a showing of necessity protect the park owners right to a fair return on investment thus eliminating the need for rent increases above ten percent upon change of ownership ghowever this council recognizes that a rent stabilization ordinance must be fair and equitable for all parties and must provide appropriate incentives for mobile home park operators to continue their parks profitably as well as to attract additional investors for new parks  part 1988  definitions for the purpose of this chapter certain words and phrases used herein are

includes maximum density standards for the safety zones listed above which shall be calculated in accordance with the following method 1nonresidential density calculation acalculations of nonresidential density shall be based on the requirements of required parking spaces with the assumption of 13 occupants per space and gross parcel size including adjacent roads to centerline of the rightofway nonresidential density shall be calculated prior to reductions for shared use trip reduction bicycle etc in determining allowed persons per acre all fractions shall be rounded to the nearest whole number bexampleproposed development two office buildings each two stories and containing twenty thousand square feet of floor area per building site size is three net acres counting the adjacent road to centerline of the rightofway three and onehalf acres gross the number of people on the property is assumed to equal 13 times the number of parking spaces cthe average usage intensity would therefore be calculated as follows i40000 sq feet  floor area x 10 parking space per 300 sq feet    134 ii134 parking spaces x 13 persons per space   174 persons per acre iii174 persons35 acres gross site size   50 persons per acre average for the site 2exceptions subject to approval of an administrative use permit the director may determine another method of density calculation is

citizenry therefore the council does hereby adopt these floodplain management regulations bfindings of fact 1the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards that increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses cstatement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within floodprone mudslide ie mudflow andor floodrelated erosion areas these regulations are designed to 1protect human life and health  2minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4minimize prolonged business interruptions  5minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  7ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions dmethods of reducing flood losses to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes regulations to 1restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  2require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  4control filling grading dredging and other development that may increase flood damage  5prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards in other areas  and 6these regulations take precedence over any less restrictive conflicting local laws ordinances and codes exh b 2018  definitions words or phrases used in

4if subsections f1 and f2 of this section are satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this subsection exh b 2018  variance procedure for floodplains anature of floodplain variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria contained in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate bconditions for variances 1generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level  provided that the procedures of administration and  provisions for flood hazard reduction of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in general definitions under floodplain management regulations upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter 5any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the floodplain administrator that athe issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and bsuch construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county of san luis obispo recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 6the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for hisher issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency cauthority to grant variances notwithstanding the provisions of variances the council shall be responsible for conducting public hearings on variances pertaining to the provisions of this chapter and for acting upon such variance applications 1in acting upon requests for variances the council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors and standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the adanger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  bdanger

duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and kcosts of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges 2variances shall only be issued upon a ashowing of good and sufficient cause  bdetermination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and cdetermination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a public nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 3variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use  provided that the provisions of subsections c1 c4 of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 4upon consideration of the factors of subsection b of this section and the purposes of this chapter the council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter exh b 2018 street regulations building setback lines for master plan of streets  street rightofway dedication and improvement
