is divided into chapters and often further divided into subchapters numbering is reserved between subchapters to allow for future expansion for an example notice how is constructed to allow additional provisions to be added to each of the four subchapter categories all chapters and subchapters consist of numbered sections the section number identifies the title chapter and section of the provision cited the title and chapter number appear to the left of the decimal point and the section number appears to the right of the decimal point for example the number3020 refers to section 20 of in title iii while 9202 refers to section 02 of in title ix furthermore the section number suffix 99 is always reserved for penalty provisions thus  designates the penalty provision for general penalty a general penalty has been supplied in  1099 this general penalty applies to areas of the code where a penalty is needed but is not otherwise specifically provided by another provision of the code crossreferences and statutory references crossreferences direct the user to another part of the code of ordinances which may be relevant to the topic at hand statutory references refer the user to certain state law provisions relevant to the topic at hand and which in most cases are separately published legislative histories legislative histories are found throughout the code and give the source of origin of particular provisions histories are placed in parentheses directly following sections or divisions of the code most typically histories provide the derivation of any ordinances statutes or prior code sections page numbering each title of the code is separately paginated which allows individual titles to be amended without having to renumber the entire code for example if the village adds more pages to title iii during a supplement the pages in title iii will be renumbered accordingly however the remaining titles v  will be unaffected because their selfcontained pagination is independent from title iii page numbers in the code are located at the top corner of each page except when at the start of a new title chapter or the like in those instances the lead number is found at the bottom center of the page headers boldprinted headers appear at the top of each regular page of the code headers on evennumbered pages display the name of the town and of the title being consulted headers on oddnumbered pages display the name of the chapter being consulted title i general provisions general provisions chapter 10 general provisions title of code 1002interpretation

main extension was constructed by one developer and connected or utilized at a later date by one or more developers for this purpose a sewer main is defined as a main extended beyond the limits of the project or a main constructed along the frontage or boundary of the development with capacity to serve additional developments however the developer must pay all the costs for engineering design and construction of main sewers of the size as to afford adequate capacity and service for specific service areas to be served by town trunk sewers bthe town engineer will not perform field engineering or submit detailed plans and specifications for the developer this latter work is to be performed by a civil engineer registered in the state employed by the developer the final details plans and specifications for the main sewer extension must be approved by the town engineer and the public works director before construction begins the engineering costs for preparation of plans and staking of the main sewer incurred by the developer may be included as determined by the director in the agreed construction costs as provided in this section cthe final detailed plans and specifications for the
