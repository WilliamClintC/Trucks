not accessible to the public the only improvements on the property are rainbird way an improved vacated rightofway running northsouth from gladstone street which essentially bisects the site an eastwest running asphalt roadway which runs perpendicular to rainbird way and the aforementioned covered loading dock situated in the northwestern corner of the property the site is otherwise undeveloped existing land uses are shown on exhibit 3 hereto the project site is currently zoned c3 retail and commercial under the city of glendora zoning c3 zone permits a wide range of commercial uses and is intended to provide a flexible method to develop land as a unit this designation allows the use of site planning techniques that are not possible literal interpretation of zoning and subdivision regulations the land use element of the citys general plan recognizes the project site as regional shopping center the zoning for the proposed project is intended to achieve the following

welfare uses allowed in the c3 zone include commercial industrial and mixed uses although previous development plans have been tendered no such uses have been developed to date the site is located within the boundaries of the glendora redevelopment agency project area no 1 c surrounding land use land uses surrounding the glendora commercial specific plan site are characterized by singlefamily residential development located to the south and west of the site with commercial and light industrial located to the east the properties located along the south side of gladstone street are within the city of san dimas gladstone elementary school is located between shellman and bolton avenues southwest of the project site the majority of the properties fronting the south side of gladstone street have been developed as singlefamily residences these homes are separated from gladstone street by long expanses of concrete block walls a chevron service station is located at the southwest corner of gladstone street and lone hill avenue land uses along the sites eastern boundary are typified by commercial andor light industrial uses specific uses located east of lone hill avenue include an auto body shop and lowrise office space properties farther east and north of the site are more intensely developed with a wider range of commercial uses three car dealerships are located at and to the east of the northeast corner of auto center drive and lone hill avenue a walmart retail outlet is located southeast of this intersection directly west of the site lay approximately thirty acres of vacant land of similar character to the project site development beyond this acreage located along valley center avenue is typified by singlefamily residences public recreational facilities the glendora sports park and flood control structures abut the sites northern boundary residential uses extend north beyond the foothill freeway a mix of residential commercial and light industrial uses may be found in areas east of the foothill freeway b existing circulation 1 regional circulation the project site has excellent regional access primary regional access to the site is provided by the foothill freeway located approximately onequarter mile to the north and east of the site in addition the site is reasonably accessible to the san bernardino i10 orange sr57 and corona sr71 freeways these three freeways located within four miles of the glendora commercial specific plan site provide access tofrom the greater los angeles metropolitan area the inland empire and orange county 2 local circulation an extensive road network is available in and around the project site important northsouth roadways in the area include from east to west san dimas avenue lone hill avenue glendora avenue and grand avenue lone hill avenue immediately adjacent to and providing the major northsouth access to the site is classified as a divided arterial the aforementioned roadways with the exception of san dimas avenue intersect with i210 i10 or both important eastwest arterials in the project area include from south to north badillo streetcovina boulevard arrow highway gladstone street baseline road alosta avenue and foothill boulevard badillo streetcovina boulevard arrow highway baseline road alosta avenue and foothill boulevard are classified as primary roads acting as regional arteries that run residential and commercial areas badillo streetcovina boulevard and arrow highway provide access to i210 directly south of the foothill freeway located adjacent to lone hill avenue is a park and ride facility operated by the california department of transportation 3 rail service the at & sf railroad rightofway abuts the northeastern corner of the glendora commercial specific plan site this railway runs in a northwesterlysoutheasterly direction away from the site rail access to the project site is not planned c existing physical condition 1 topography the glendora commercial specific plan site is essentially flat sloping to the southwest minimum elevation on the site is eight hundred fortyeight feet above mean sea level amsl in the southwestern corner of the property the northeastern corner of the site reaches a maximum height of eight hundred seventyseven feet amsl 2 hydrology the water table in the main glendora groundwater basin has been lowered over the years water production to where it is now one hundred to three hundred feet below the surface neither natural watercourses nor open bodies of water exist on the project site runoff from the site will be conveyed via manmade drainage structures 3 soils soils present in a majority of glendoras valley area and thus the project site fall within the hanford association of soils the soils of this association occur on gently sloping alluvial fans between elevations from near sea level to three thousand five hundred feet hanford soils are over sixty inches deep are well drained and have moderately rapid subsoil permeability they have palebrown coarse sandy loam surface layers about eight inches thick underlain by light yellowishbrown coarse sandyloam and gravelly loamy coarse sand substratum excavation limitations of soils in the majority of the city and thus the project site are considered slight meaning there is a general absence of cobbles stones or a water table that could significantly affect excavation and construction activities subsidence andor expansive soils are not known geologic hazards that may affect the project site 4 seismicity generally it can be anticipated that any development in southern california will have the potential to be adversely impacted by seismic activity the degree to which the development is impacted is dependent on numerous variables such as but not limited to distance to the nearest active fault bedrock structure water content in the soil and type and quality of construction materials it is anticipated that the site has the potential to be impacted by seismic events throughout the life of the project overall southern california is part of the most seismically active region in the united states seismic activity associated with regional fault zones has been the source of large historic earthquakes and is likely to be the source of future earthquakes that will affect development in the city the san andreas elsinore newportinglewood and san fernando faults generated m6+ earthquakes in 190 191 193 and 1971 notable historic earthquakes in the region include m825 fort tejon earthquake 1857  m63 long beach earthquake 1933  m59 whittier narrows earthquake 1987  m58 sierra madre earthquake 1991  m61 joshua tree 1992 m75 landers 1992  m60 big bear earthquake 1992 and m67 northridge earthquake 1994 glendora is located at the foot of the san gabriel mountains on an upper alluvial fan of the san gabriel valley the dominant geologic feature in the city is the sierra madre fault zone that branches along the foot of the san gabriel mountains the san fernando fault a branch of the sierra madre fault system ruptured on  causing the san fernandosylmar earthquake subsequent seismic activity on the this fault zone resulted in the 1991 sierra madre earthquake m58 the sierra madre fault zone is now considered potentially active meaning that ground rupture could occur along the systems surface traces the glendora commercial specific plan site would be exposed to seismic activity during any future seismic event on the sierra madre fault system lower groundwater level caused by domestic water production has reduced the potential for seismically induced liquefaction and subsidence in the area 5 wildlifevegetation the original natural state of the site has been modified by agricultural uses the project site consists of undeveloped fallow fields covered with lowlying nonnative vegetation consisting primarily of perennial weeds grasses and shrubs a few mature trees are scattered about the site the site does not harbor any rare or threatened plant species because of the disturbed nature of the site the majority of the animal species expected to reside on the site are mammals and birds that can tolerate close human contact no notable or threatened species of animal has been identified on the site 6 climate the project site area has a mediterranean climate with warm to hot summers and generally mild winters the strength and location of a semipermanent subtropical highpressure cell over the pacific ocean strongly influences the areas climate climate is also affected by the moderating effects of differential heating between the land area of california and the adjacent pacific ocean warmtohot summers mild winters limited precipitation moderate daytime onshore breezes and

infrastructure systems required to serve the project site a utilities 1 water facilities water service to the glendora commercial specific plan site will be provided by the city of glendoras water division the water division obtains sixtyfive percent of its water from three local underground basins the upper san gabriel basin the main san gabriel basin and the glendora basin this groundwater supply is supplemented by water purchases from the metropolitan water district mwd three valleys municipal water district water lines within adjacent streets include a fourteeninch water main in gladstone street a twentyone inch water line in lone hill avenue and a twelveinch water line in rainbird way to be abandoned given the size of these existing water mains adequate capacity and water pressure will be available for the project site including average daily and peak daily use and fire flows based on maximum building area land use and water consumption factors it is estimated that the proposed project will require forty thousand gallons of water per day gpd table a table a estimated average daily water use land use type average water demand gallons per square foot per day daily

lacfd fire flow requirements for fully sprinkled buildings this flow is greater than that which is needed to accommodate the domestic water demands of the land uses proposed within the project site all buildings within the specific plan area will be provided with fire sprinkler systems the placement of hydrants and other fire suppression facilitiesdevices shall conform to lacfd standards water will be provided on site via the looped system shown in figure 1 the primary loop will connect to an existing twentyone inch line within lone hill avenue and a fourteeninch line within gladstone street the existing twelveinch water line in rainbird way shall be abandoned the water supply required by the proposed development will be provided by additional purchases from the mwd as is the case for all new development in the city mwd has indicated that as long as population increases within the city are within southern california association of governments scag projections the city will be able to purchase additional water to serve additional development because the project site has long been planned and zoned for commercial use the proposed projects water requirements will be adequately met by water purchases from mwd all onsite water lines will be located within public utility easements and will be maintained by the city of glendora water division all water system improvements needed to serve the project site will be constructed by the developer 2 wastewater facilities los angeles county sanitation district lacsd no 22 serves the entire eastern san gabriel valley area including the city of glendora and the project site this agency is responsible for conveying sewage to regional treatment plants providing sewage treatment and disposing of effluent and solids the existing sewer mains in lone hill avenue and gladstone street are maintained by lacsd no 22 the project developer will pay for the cost and installation of all sewer lines needed to serve the site wastewater from the proposed project will discharge from an onsite sewer system into lacsd sunflower trunk sewer which is located in gladstone street this fifteeninch diameter trunk has a peak capacity of five million two hundred thousand gallons a day mgd and conveyed a peak flow of 08 mgd when last measured in 1996 additional sewer structures include a twelveinch sewer line in lone hill avenue and an eightinch sewer line extending in rainbird way the wastewater generated by the proposed project will be treated at the san jose creek water reclamation plant wrp located adjacent to the city of industry this facility has a design capacity of one hundred million gallons per day mgd and is currently processing ninety mgd this facility currently has a ten mgd surplus capacity wastewater flows which exceed the capacity of the san jose creek wrp and all sludge are diverted to and treated at the joint water pollution control plant jwpcp located in the city of carson based on an average generation rate of four thousand one hundred sixtysix gallons per acre the project site will generate approximately two hundred thousand gallons of wastewater per day peak wastewater flows will average five hundred thousand gallons per day based on a peaking factor of 25 the size of sewer lines required for new development is regulated by los angeles county department of public works lacdpw lacdpw determines pipe size based on a formula that factors the size and slope of the area to be served based on lacdpw standards eightinch sewer lines will be constructed buildings fronting on lone hill avenue will be connected to the existing twelveinch line in lone hill sewer lines for all other buildings including autorelated retail buildings in the northeasterly portion of the site will drain via the new system to the existing fifteeninch line in gladstone street the existing eightinch sewer line in rainbird way shall be abandoned 3 storm drains the construction of structures and parking areas within the project site will increase the amount of impermeable surfaces resulting in reduced absorption rates and increased surface runoff storm flows from the project site have been estimated at one hundred cubic feet per second cfs during a tenyear storm event and one hundred eightyfive cfs during a one hundredyear storm event onsite storm drain facilities will ultimately convey flows to the southwest corner of the project site where it will drain into the existing sixtysix inch rcf in gladstone street there are no offsite contributions to predicted storm runoff stormwater flows shall be metered where the onsite storm drain system connects to the sixtysix inch gladstone street line to limit peak flows to eightyfive cfs per the 1964 bond issue hydraulic design as noted above ten and one hundredyear surface runoff generated by the proposed site will exceed this allocation thus onsite stormwater detention is required a system of buried sixtyinch reinforced storm drains will be installed to temporarily detain storm flows in excess of the eightyfive cfs allowed this detention facility will be installed along the western boundary of the project site north of the proposed building area the capacity of this proposed facility will total approximately one hundred twentytwo thousand cubic feet cf or storage the stormwater detained in this facility will be discharged at a time and in a manner that will not exceed the eightyfive cfs allocated to the project site manhole access to this detention facility will be provided to allow for ongoing maintenance storm drain facilities within the gladstone street rightofway will be maintained by the lacfcd while onsite storm drains detention facilities and storm drain inlets will be maintained by the project owner the utility plan for the proposed project shall be designed in accordance with these guidelines  the conceptual utility plan for the proposed project is illustrated in figure 1 4 solid waste

designed to emphasize the lone hill avenue access points one access point which prohibits leftturn eastbound exiting movements will be located along gladstone street use of gladstone street for ingressegress to the site is discouraged by the limited curb cut of this driveway as well as its provision at a location that is inconvenient for the majority of patrons accessing the project site as noted above physical configurations of the proposed gladstone street driveway immediately west of lone hill avenue allows access limited to rightin rightout and leftin turns this design feature not only discourages general use of this driveway but also serves to reduce potential turn movement conflicts between traffic utilizing this drive and utilizing gladstone street administrative provisions and signage of the specific plan prohibit direct access to the project site from gladstone street by heavy trucks and delivery vehicles truck traffic shall follow the routes established in figure 9 with the exception of city sponsored dialaride services public transportation shall not circulate on site internal circulation will be via a fourlane internal drive center of the site which will

note  prior ordinance history introduction a location the village on the green specific plan area development name saratoga is located at the northwestern intersection of amelia avenue and route 66 old alosta avenue in the northeast area of the city the 201acre site is vacant and surrounded by a variety of urban and recreational development including commercial industrial golf course a church and multifamily residential land uses b project overview the village on the green specific plan provides the city with a set of plans regulations and guidelines to create a quality planned residential community orderly development of the site the specific plan envisions the creation of an amenity and familyoriented community that will provide a new midrange residential housing opportunities in the city of glendora the specific plan provides for a planned residential community of sixtyfive singlefamily homes with a variety of residential products and architectural styles the development will incorporate design concepts that recall the historic glendora foothill character featuring local architectural themes and materials and the majority of existing oak and palm trees retained transplanted or replaced on site common park and landscape areas are provided within the site with heavily planted landscape areas along amelia avenue and route 66 old alosta avenue the proposed plan implements the general plans planned redevelopment designation by specifying permitted residential use on the site and establishing the allowable density c purpose of the specific plan the purpose of the village on the green specific plan is to allow comprehensive development of the site while implementing the city of glendoras general plan goals as they relate to development of the specific plan area the specific plan is prepared pursuant to california government et seq as described in f of this chapter and the city of glendora municipal  the specific plan serves as the direct link between the general plans policies and the design of the proposed residential development project the specific plan articulates planning considerations and imposes regulations andor controls it provides a comprehensive description of land use circulation infrastructure site development standards and implementation programs for owners architects developers and builders in the preparation of detailed development proposals for city review and approval specifically the village on the green specific plan is designed to 1 establish specific land use and density under the glendora general plan planned redevelopment designation  2 provide a comprehensive land use plan that designates the distribution of land uses and roadways within the community  3 provide regulations and standards which allow flexibility for creative site design and development while assuring quality and value  4 assure a compatible interface with surrounding land uses  5 provide for preservation of natural features including preservation of the majority of existing oak trees and grading which minimizes alteration of existing land forms  6 establish the required infrastructure for development of the proposed residential community including the completion of the area storm drain system and eliminating annual flooding of the glendora country club 5th fairway and lake  and 7 provide development regulations and procedures to control future improvements by individual homeowners d relationship to the general plan the city of glendora general plan land use element recognizes the use of specific plans to implement general plan policies specific plans can relate to site and area conditions which may not be fully addressed by conventional zoning specific plans are especially effective on sites with physical or locational constraints whereas zoning regulations must be applied broadly throughout the community a specific plan can be designated to facilitate the development of a specific site while protecting particular features or conditions on or surrounding the site the california government specific plans to regulate site development including uses permitted density building placement and bulk and the provision of open space landscaping streets and utilities these provisions allow greater flexibility than is possible with conventional zoning since conditions can be established based on a specific site with unique conditions consequently requirements can vary from one parcel to another to achieve a coordinated development  city of glendora general plan 1991201 p 24 the glendora municipal the development and administration of specific plans in accordance with the california government the citys general plan the general plan land use designation for the village on the green property is planned redevelopment pr as described in the general plan land use element the planned redevelopment designation is intended to provide a flexible method to develop land as a unit for various uses in redevelopment areas this designation allows the use of the site planning techniques that are not possible literal interpretation of zoning and subdivision regulations uses may include residential commercial industrial and mixed uses compatibility must be maintained between proposed uses and adjacent land uses the village on the green specific plan specifies singlefamily residential land use with a gross density of 32 duunit per acre including shared parks and community open space this density is significantly less than the adjacent glendora greens condominium project 83 duunit per acre to the east of the site and the wild rose condominium project 112 duunit per acre southeast of the site in the city of san dimas specification of residential development on the site is supported by a land use analysis prepared by alfred gobar associates which concluded that commercial light industrial andor business office park uses permitted by the planned redevelopment pr land use designation are not economically feasible on the project site because of location existing available space city emphasis on the development of the auto center drive lone hill and gladstone commercial and business properties and glendoras low absorption rate for these uses historically the citys general plan committee in 1992 recommended that the general plan be changed to allow residential development on the project site at a density of eleven to fifteen unitsunit per acre  the planning commission reviewed the committees recommendation and in turn recommended a residential density of three to six unitsunit per acre subsequently the city council voted to retain existing zoning pursuant to california government the village on the green specific plan provides regulations guidelines and standards that are consistent with and implement the goals and policies of the citys general plan in particular the following general plan goals objectives and policies are addressed 1 land use element a goal compatible adjacent land uses throughout the community i objectives to buffer residential areas from nonresidential land uses ii policies a development should include adequate buffering between adjacent land uses b development shall be consistent with the general plan zoning and all other applicable regulations the village on the green specific plan sets forth regulations for

completed before processing of the specific plan amendment the northern culdesac shown on ttm 524 the original specific plan area was constructed prior to processing of the specific plan amendment the culdesac will be removed and related lot lines adjusted for the street extension b surrounding land uses as shown in the annotated aerial photo exhibit 1 the project site is bounded by the glendora country club to the north los angeles county fire station no 86 and the glendora greens 60unit condominium development across amelia avenue to the east the church of the latter day saints and a twostory office building to the west and commercial development across route 66 old alosta avenue to the south the wild rose condominium development exists southeast of the site in the city of san dimas all surrounding properties are developed c topography on the eastern portion of the site existing site topography shown in exhibits 1a and 1b existing topography consists of a gentle slope from the southeast corner of the site at the intersection of amelia avenue and route 66 old alosta avenue to the northwest with an approximate tenfoot grade breakslope occurring eastwest across the site an existing storm drain under amelia avenue outlets to a natural drainage channel on the site which drains northwesterly to an inlet structure in the glendora country club 5th fairway area the inlet structure is inadequate to handle the existing storm water flows thus causing annual flooding a graded slope onsite along the southwestern property line drains into a planter along the adjacent church of later day saints parking lot to the west elevations ranger from approximately nine hundred ten feet above sea level at the northwest corner of the site to nine hundred fifty feet at the southeast corner of the property the western portion of the site shown on exhibit 1b slopes generally from the south to the north with an elevation of nine hundred twenty three feet just inside of the church parking lotproperty line to nine hundred two feet at the country club boundary d geologysoils the site is located between the san gabriel and chino basins and between the san dimas wash and the big dalton wash the san gabriel mountains glendora block lie to the north and the san jose hills lie south of the project site holocene within the last eleven thousand years and pleistocene eleven thousand to one million eight hundred thousand years age alluvium underlie the site and surrounding developed area and is considered stable the vegetation across the site is light to heavy and consists of grasses weeds and trees e seismicity no faults fissure or shear zones have been observed on the project site and no previously identified faults have been found to traverse the site the site does not lie within an alquistpriolo earthquake fault zone the south frontal fault zone lies approximately one thousand feet north of the project site this fault is in part responsible for the uplift of the hills located approximately one thousand feet north of the property this fault is not considered active since it is not zoned under the alquistpriolo earthquake fault zoning act the sierramadre fault is located approximately two miles north of the project site and this fault is considered active since there are no active faults on the site the probability of hazards due to fault ground rupture is considered low due to the overall favorable geologic structure and topography of the area the potential for earthquakeinduced landslides or rockfalls is considered low due to a lack of shallow groundwater and the dense nature of the underlying soils the possibility of hazards due to liquefaction is considered low f hydrology and drainage the 201acre site drains gradually from southeast to northwest the existing drainage pattern and flood hazard areas are shown in exhibits 3a and 3b a conceptual hydrology and drainage study is contained in appendix c and appendix h of this specific plan on file with the city clerk a natural drainage course crosses the northeast portion of the site surface flows on the site drain in a northerly direction toward the glendora country club in addition to surface flows from the project site the onsite natural drainage course conveys flows from a los angeles county maintained rectangular concrete open flood control channel adjacent to the fire station on the east side of amelia avenue that is a part of miscellaneous transfer drain mtd number 778 these flows are conveyed under amelia avenue via a concrete culvert box into the onsite natural drainage course to an existing corrugated steel pipe inlet located on the south side of the fifth fairway of the glendora country club this inlet also receives some flows from the golf course see exhibits 4a and 4b conceptual drainage plan this inlet is connected via the existing inverness drain to an existing eightyseveninch diameter storm drain pipe located adjacent to the northwest corner of the specific plan area on the glendora country club property and known as mtd number 932 it lies within a county of los angeles twentysevenfootwide storm drain easement during low frequency storms where high rainfall intensities occur the flows onsite natural drainage course are too high to be intercepted by the inlet at the glendora country club and flooding of the fifth fairway and lake on the golf course occurs g natural features live oak trees form the dominant natural site features native oaks citrus and other trees indigenous to the area have been cleared from surrounding sites with development existing trees onsite have been mapped and identified and are shown in exhibits 5a and 5b existing trees detailed in exhibit 6 existing trees statistical summary the san gabriel mountains form the scenic backdrop to the site and the dominant northerly view from the site along with views to the adjacent glendora country club golf course  2004  project description a development

this article b the policy framework for the route 66 corridor specific plan is organized into the following sections 1 specific plan planning factors identifies the opportunities and constraints that influence and contribute to the successful implementation of the route 66 corridor specific plan 2 specific plan guiding principles provides the broad principles that future development and redevelopment in the specific plan area shall implement 3 specific plan objectives provides more explicit policy statements that implement the specific plans guiding principles  2017  specific plan planning factors a a number of opportunities constraints issues concerns and positive and negative attributesplanning factorsexist that influenced the development of the route 66 corridor specific plan planning factors that contribute to the ultimate policy actions of this specific plan the sources of these planning factors include recommendations made by the alosta corridor committee  input received by the community and the city council during workshops on route 66 see above  input received by the community planning commission and city council public meetings that resulted in a substantial revision to the policies and goals of the specific plan in 2017  and observations and analysis made throughout the route 66 corridor specific plan process b these planning factors although not an exhaustive listing form the policy foundation of the specific plan seeking to optimize the consistency between the specific plans policy direction and the regulations and standards contained within throughout the initial stages of the planning process for route 66 the following primary planning factors have been identified for the route 66 corridor specific plan the revision of the specific plan occurring during the period from 2014201 substantially altered the original goals of the route 66 specific plan the revised vision for the corridor is reflected in the planning factors 1 a significant body of work was generated under the guidance of the alosta corridor committeewith recommendations on property acquisition land use rehabilitation assistance business attraction business retention streetscape and environmentthat forms a strong foundation for the route 66 corridor specific plan 2 between 2003 and 201 the specific plan did not satisfy community expectations or produce anticipated results mixeduse development a primary objective of the specific plan is weaker than anticipated factors contributing to weak mixeduse demand include the autooriented nature of route 66 and an ample supply of existing commercial space additionally development incentives and bonuses resulted in comparatively large buildings leading to significant community opposition to the specific plan insufficient parking requirements onstreet parking credits and parking reductions have contributed to operational problems and persisting vacant mixeduse commercial spaces 3 accelerated outsourcing of american manufacturing the great recession and the end of redevelopment in california are primary reasons that the route 66 specific plan has not fulfilled expectations for commercial industrial and hitech office development without redevelopment to assist in the assembly of viable commercial development sites the economics do not support substantial private investment in these areas 4 many distinctive character areas exist within the route 66 corridor specific plan that require tailored land use and urban design treatments to optimize their potential and most effectively respect the existing character unique to glendora 5 since glendora is a community that is largely builtout and the route 66 corridor specific plan is an area that includes many small shallow parcels economic development and revitalization must be achieved approaches that seek to optimize the potential of already urbanized land 6 slow expected population and job growth in glendora and the surrounding area suggests a slow future pace of economic development and associated new real estate development but favorable socioeconomic and demographic characteristics in glendora may allow capture of a greater share of regional growth 7 the residents of glendora strongly desire increased dining and family entertainment opportunities within the city  creating the market to support these amenities is a key challenge within the route 66 corridor 8 glendora serves and will likely continue to serve as a bedroom community for outcommuters who work across a broad region between los angeles pasadena orange county and the inland empire 9 future plans of the los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority will include the eastward extension of the gold line light rail transit system with a transit station in glendora at the former railroad station site providing unique development opportunities in the vicinity of the potential station 10 public and private development within the route 66 corridor specific plan area must be respectful of existing adjacent neighborhoods to ensure compatibility and minimize negative impacts to residential stability 11 notable opportunities to improve the aesthetics of the architecture and streetscape within the route 66 corridor specific plan area exist which may contribute to enhanced economic development potential improved sense of place heightened community pride and a more inviting environment for visitors 12 recognizing that public resources must be distributed for optimal costbenefit to the community public investment in a renewed streetscape environment must leverage an image that supports the traditional character of glendora while promoting a positive identity and serving as a catalyst for private reinvestment 13 the glendora residential market has rebounded strongly from the great recession which should lead to new residential development contributing to the demand for residential development is glendoras centralized location for commuters highquality schools and a general shortage of housing in the southern california region with the growing need for a variety of housing choices to accommodate a diverse range of income groups within the community the route 66 corridor specific plan area should offer opportunities for new housing to meet goals in the housing element and to comply with state mandates and enhancing the condition of existing affordable housing such as mobile home parks located along route 66 14 the infrastructure system within the route 66 corridor specific plan area must be adequate to support future development and therefore the route 66 corridor specific plan land use buildout assumptions must take into account the need for corresponding infrastructure to support future development 15 grand avenue and glendora avenue two key corridors between highway 210 and route 66 serve as economic nodes connecting regional and local markets and to provide northsouth gateways for the city 16 traffic speed is a greater concern than traffic congestion with the route 66 corridor specific plan area  therefore traffic calming and enhancing the pedestrianorientation and safety of streets in the area is important to the community 17 the area around the future gold line station is evolving into two functionally distinct areas a barrier is created by the existing street layout and residential development north of the railroad track creates a natural transition from higher intensity development along route 66 to the historic lower scale areas near to the village 18 the development review and approval process employed in the city could benefit from adopted design guidelines to provide applicants with a reference for the quality of development expected by the city  2017  specific plan guiding principles the following guiding principles provide the foundation for of the route 66 specific plan and are intended to serve as a benchmark for the analysis of future proposals and design concepts to determine if they are supportive of the spirit and intent of this plan a guiding principle 10 increase and maintain an increased

describes the required infrastructure improvements necessary to meet the demands of the preferred land use plan as this project is a policylevel plan it should be noted that the timing of all infrastructure improvements identified in this section represent the ultimate buildout conditions of the route 66 corridor specific plan a domestic water system 1 domestic waterexisting conditions a the citys water delivery system was created purchase of small private water companies and by the citys own expansion projects as shown in exhibit 416existing domestic water system the system is comprised of eleven service zones containing approximately two hundred miles of pipe the city receives water from two sources  groundwater pumping and imported water obtained from the metropolitan water district of southern california portions of the water supply system have been identified as requiring rehabilitation or replacement in the nearterm this is mainly due to reaches of pipe that are over fifty years old or pipe diameters that do not meet city standards for providing current fire flow requirements b the route 66 corridor specific plan area is located in the citys zone 1 and zone 2 service areas the land use districts located in the zone 1 service area are barranca gateway town center mixed use route 66 service commercial portion grand avenue gateway mixed use and central route 66 residential zone 1 is the largest zone within the citys system and varies in elevation from six hundred twenty feet above mean sea level amsl at gladstone street and barranca avenue to eight hundred ninety feet amsl at ben lomond north of sierra madre avenue the zone is served from a high water elevation of 9695 feet amsl by five reservoirs refer to exhibit 416existing domestic water system for identification of the existing zone 1 system within the route 66 corridor specific plan area c the zone 2 service area is located to the east of zone 1 the development areas in the zone 2 service area are lone hill gateway and glendora technologycommercialoffice and the remaining portion of route 66 service commercial zone 2 service elevations vary from eight hundred ten feet amsl at alosta avenue and the big dalton wash to one thousand thirty feet amsl north of oak knoll drive with a high water level of one thousand ninety feet amsl four reservoirs provide head to the zone with locations at three different sites the zone 2 system within the specific plan area is shown in exhibit 416existing domestic water system d the existing domestic water demand for the specific plan area was calculated using the current land use and demand factors from the citys water master plan demands were calculated for each of the land use districts based on a field survey identifying existing land uses by visual appearance and information obtained in the citys geographic information system gis table 42water demand factors summarizes the water usage factors used for this study as provided in table v3 of the citys wmp table 42 water demand factors land use residential water demand factor gpddu nonresidential water demand factor gpdac commercial  2900 singlefamily 600  multifamily 400  mobilehome 400  motel  2900 medical  4600 religious  2000 e the existing average day water demand for the specific plan area is calculated in table 42water demand factors to be 098 mgd using the max day factor of 185 from the wmp the existing max day demand is estimated to be one thousand two hundred fiftyfour gallons per minute gpm f under the water master plan several recommendations were made the wmp determined several reaches of pipe within the study area to be either undersized for fire flow requirements or of such age that replacement was recommended most of the existing system currently remains the same as it was at the time of the writing of the wmp in particular the backbone to both the zones 1 and 2 systems is a parallel eightinch loop running on each side of route 66 these parallel lines were constructed in 19351936 and 1954 therefore the wmp which set a fifty year lifespan determined these pipelines require upgrading 2 proposed domestic water system improvements a a water demand analysis was performed for this study existing demands were estimated for the study area shown in exhibit 417domestic water system improvements as described above identical water usage factors per table v3 of the city wmp as included in the appendix were applied to the existing and proposed land uses for the specific plan area table 43estimated domestic water demand summarizes the estimated demands and provides a sidebyside comparison the average day demand for the proposed redeveloped area is 141 mgd the max day demand for the proposed redevelopment area is one thousand eight hundred ten gpm b the proposed system recommended should be planned to current operating standards or as close to current standards as feasible according to the city staff the existing system was based upon an approximate one thousand two hundred fifty gpm fire flow for residential and small commercial land use and two thousand five hundred for large commercial the current fire flow standard is provided in the wmp for the city which states two thousand two hundred fifty gpm for two hours for singlefamily residential two thousand five hundred gpm for two hours for multifamily residential one thousand seven hundred fifty gpm for two hours for mobilehome and five thousand gpm for five hours for large commercial eight inch lines under current fire flow standards are typically only sufficient for mobile home or singlefamily residential land uses the wmp includes recommendations to replace the two eightinch lines with a single eighteeninch line to serve both sides of route 66 however the city has decided to continue maintaining a parallel system the parallel pipeline layout facilitates service to each side of the street therefore it is recommended that a fourteeninch diameter pipe replace each eightinch pipeline in order to provide the same capacity as the masterplanned eighteeninch c based on this analysis the following is a list of recommended system improvements for adequate service to the route 66 corridor redevelopment project i the zone 2 eightinch diameter pipelines within route 66 from lorraine avenue east to amelia avenue should be upsized to fourteeninch or dual twelveinch diameter pipelines to achieve the anticipated five thousand gpm fire flow requirements of the route 66 commercial land use district ii upsize the pipeline in lorraine avenue as proposed in the wmp improvement project e4 to a minimum of a sixteeninch for the looped system within zone 1 d exhibit 417domestic water system improvements shows the changes recommended for the system the proposed system upgrades described here will improve system capacity however computer modeling would be necessary to verify that current fire flow standards are met table 43 estimated domestic water demand refer to specific plan eir b wastewater system 1 existing wastewater system a the portion of the citys wastewater system that will be used for the route 66 corridor redevelopment project is a gravity system that flows to the los angeles county sanitation district 22 trunk sewer lines the citys gravity sewers will collect the generated wastewater flows within the specific plan area the general direction of the wastewater flow is east to west the lorraine avenue trunk and baseline road trunk sewers convey the flows from the existing land uses within the study area to the main los angeles county sanitation trunk tiein at the intersection of barranca avenue and baseline road exhibit 418wastewater system shows alignments and diameters of the existing sewers within the study area b in the absence of city standards typical industrystandard watertowastewater return ratios were used for estimating wastewater flows the return ratio figures are

sewer is currently being monitored it is estimated that the flows from the route 66 corridor study area will increase by approximately thirtyfour percent from existing flows as discussed in the following section and shown in exhibit 418wastewater system and table 45estimated wastewater generation 2 proposed wastewater system improvements a wastewater flow analysis was performed for this study and existing wastewater generation figures were estimated identical wastewater flow factors per table v3 of the city wmp with return ratios were applied to the existing and proposed land uses for the specific plan area table 45estimated wastewater generation summarizes the estimated flows and provides a sidebyside comparison the average flow for the proposed redeveloped area is 106 mgd the peak wastewater estimated for the route 66 corridor redevelopment project is one thousand four hundred seventy gpm the existing trunk sewers within the collection system evaluated for the redevelopment project may or may not require upsizing or realigning monitoring at key locations during development would indicate whether this is necessary as discussed below 3 wastewater system recommendations analysis of the existing wastewater collection system and proposed flow increase indicates there is adequate facilities to serve the redevelopment project it is recommend flow monitors be installed at key locations based on this analysis rbf consulting recommends the seven sewer locations within the study area and described in table 45estimated wastewater generation should undergo extendedperiod flow monitoring at the seventyfive and ninetyfivepercent buildout to ensure the collection system is operating with adequate excess capacity for buildout conditions c storm drainage

fifteeninch rcp to twentyseveninch rcp there are two laterals that collect surface runoff from route 66 a twentyfour inch rcp lateral drains the north side of route 66 east of forestdale avenue a twentyseven inch rcp lateral drains the south side of route 66 east of vecino drive iii grand avenue the storm drain mainline in grand avenue between ada avenue and heber street is twentyseveninch rcp the mainline between heber street and leeside street is thirtyinch rcp the mainline between leeside street and route 66 is thirtysixinch rcp the mainline in grand avenue south of route 66 is fortyfiveinch rcp there are numerous eighteeninch rcp laterals that pick up surface runoff from grand avenue and the streets draining toward grand north of route 66 there is also a twentyoneinch rcp lateral that collects runoff from the north side of route 66 east of grand avenue iv glendora avenue the storm drain mainline in glendora avenue is thirtythreeinch rcp between colorado avenue and route 66 as well as north of route 66 to lemon avenue there are several laterals that collect runoff on glendora avenue north of route 66 that range in size from twentyoneinch to twentyfourinch rcp there is also a twentyoneinch rcp lateral that drains the north side of route 66 east of glendora avenue v pasadena avenue the storm drain mainline in pasadena avenue south of route 66 is fiftyfourinch rcp there is approximately a two hundred tenfoot stretch of the mainline just north of route 66 that is fortyfiveinch rcp however north of the stretch the mainline increases to fortyeightinch rcp there are several laterals collecting runoff from pasadena avenue ranging in size from eighteen inches to twentyoneinch rcp there are two laterals collecting runoff on route 66 there are two catch basins to intercept surface flow on the north side of route 66 east of pasadena avenue that are connected with a twentyfourinch rcp lateral there is also an eighteeninch rcp lateral collecting runoff on the south side of route 66 east of pasadena avenue vi glenwood avenue the storm drain mainline in glenwood avenue is fortyfiveinch rcp between its outlet at the big dalton wash and route 66 as well as north of route 66 there is a fifteeninch rcp lateral draining the west side of glenwood avenue just north of route 66 and another fifteeninch rcp lateral collecting surface runoff from the north side of route 66 east of glenwood avenue vii loraine avenue the storm drain mainline in loraine avenue is sixtyinch rcp between its outlet at the big dalton wash and route 66 as well as north of route 66 there is an eighteeninch rcp lateral collecting flow from the east side of loraine avenue north of route 66 there is also an eighteeninch rcp lateral collecting runoff from the north side of route 66 east of loraine avenue viii big dalton wash both the big dalton wash and the east branch of the big dalton wash cross route 66 however neither of these major flood control channels directly intercepts runoff from alosta avenue route 66 the east branch of the big dalton wash travels from east to west to its termination at the big dalton wash near the intersection of loraine avenue and route 66 the big dalton wash travels from the northeast to the southwest city a majority of the storm drain mainlines in the area drain to one of these two flood control channels ix alosta avenue drain a majority of the alosta avenue drain is a sixtysixinch rcp however near its outlet into the east branch of the big dalton wash the mainline was increased to an eightyfourinch rcp tying into this larger section of the mainline there are three laterals that collect surface runoff from route 66 a twentyoneinch rcp lateral collects runoff from the south side of the highway and an eighteeninch rcp along with a twentyoneinch rcp lateral collect runoff from the north side of the highway x route 66 there is a storm drain mainline that goes from the east branch of the big dalton wash where the wash goes under lone hill avenue to glengrove avenue which is a thirtythreeinch rcp this mainline continues approximately six hundred fiftyfeet east of glengrove avenue in route 66 but the pipe is reduced in size to a thirtyinch rcp there are several small laterals that tie into this mainline at the intersection of route 66 and glengrove avenue there is an eighteeninch rcp lateral that collects surface flows from the southeast corner of route 66 and glengrove avenue this lateral also collects runoff from the north side of route 66 east of financial way on its way to the mainline there is also an additional twentyoneinch rcp lateral that drains the north side of route 66 east of financial way at the upstream termination of this mainline there are several eighteen inches laterals that collect surface runoff from the south side of state route 66 e the location and size of all existing mainlines and laterals are shown on exhibit 419existing storm drain system the capacity as well as the physical characteristics of the main lines are provided in table 48storm drain mainline characteristics the corresponding mainline pipe numbers are shown on exhibit 419 2 storm drain system identified deficiencies a the city has observed two areas within the project area that currently experience flooding in large storm events this localized flooding occurs approximately two to three times yearly one of the two locations where flooding occurs within the project is located on the north side of route 66 between vermont avenue and grand avenue at this location runoff flows south on vermont and is never picked up in a catch basin lateral it then ponds up at the intersection of vermont and route 66 and begins to flow west on route 66 the runoff does not get into the storm drain network until the intersection of grand avenue and route 66 in that area the flow in the street overtops the eightinch curb and creates localized flooding b the other location where localized flooding occurs is on route 66 near the intersection of elwood avenue there are several catch basins on route 66 but they do not connect to a storm drain network nor are there any storm drain plans for these facilities they have a very shallow slope and move water from route 66 to the southern portion of elwood avenue where the runoff is discharged back into the street the runoff then flows south in elwood avenue to the big dalton wash table 48 storm drain mainline characteristics mainline pipe # location size slope capacity cfs material installation date 1 barranca

c this system has shown historic evidence of surcharge on route 66 because it does not have the needed head to push a large amount of water shallow box culvert 3 storm drain system improvements several alternatives for alleviating the localized flooding at the two identified problem locations have been developed there are estimated sizes and costs associated with these possible solutions however a detailed hydrology study should be preformed to determine the required size of storm drain mainlines laterals and catch basins if connection to an existing mainline is proposed a hydraulic study should also be preformed to determine whether or not additional flows can be added to existing storm drain mainlines a route 66vermont avenue improvements as shown on exhibit 420storm drain system improvements there are two possible options for alleviating the localized flooding on route 66 between grand avenue and vermont avenue both of the alternatives would involve trenching in existing pavement and laying a new storm drain line with laterals and catch basins from the mainline in grand avenue to vermont avenue all of the runoff from vermont eventually gets into the grand avenue mainline so these possible new lines will not be changing the existing drainage patterns in the area i route 66vermont option 1 the first alternative would be to run approximately one thousand seven hundred feet of thirtyinch rcp east in route 66 from the mainline in grand avenue to the intersection of route 66 and vermont avenue a catch basin and lateral on either side of vermont avenue just north of the intersection will help alleviate the flooding on route 66 ii route 66vermont option 2 some of the runoff that attributes to the flooding on route 66 comes from farther north in the city the second alternative would be to run approximately one thousand seven hundred feet of twentyfourinch rcp east in ada avenue from the mainline in grand avenue to the intersection of ada avenue and vermont avenue a catch basin and lateral on either side of vermont avenue just south of the intersection will remove some of the surface water before it becomes a problem however there will still be a large area draining to the impacted area on route 66 so this may not totally alleviate flooding in the area b route 66elwood avenue improvements as shown in exhibit 420storm drain system improvements there are two possible options for alleviating the localized flooding at the intersection of elwood avenue and route 66 both of the alternatives would involve trenching in existing pavement and laying a new storm drain line with laterals and catch basins i route 66elwood option 1 the runoff that is causing flooding at the intersection of elwood avenue and route 66 eventually sheet flows south in elwood ave to the big dalton wash the first alternative to alleviate the flooding at the intersection would be to construct approximately six hundred feet of thirtyinch rcp storm drain in elwood avenue from the big dalton wash to the intersection the existing curb inlets would need to be replaced with catch basins and laterals to the proposed mainline in elwood the construction cost including pavement removal and replacement trenching pipe traffic control and catch basins will be around one hundred fifty thousand dollars ii route 66elwood option 2 the second alternative would be to connect to the storm drain mainline in glenwood avenue however since the runoff causing localized flooding at the intersection of elwood avenue and route 66 does not get into that mainline in the existing condition a hydraulic analysis of the mainline in glenwood will need to be done to verify its capacity this alternative would include approximately seven hundred feet of thirtyinch rcp storm drain in route 66 from the mainline in glenwood avenue to the intersection the existing curb inlets would need to be replaced with catch basins and laterals to the proposed line in route 66  2017 route 66 corridor design guidelines  design guidelines users guide the users guide to the route 66 design guidelines is intended to provide interested persons with straightforward guidance for optimizing the use of the design guidelines for projects and improvements to properties within the route 66 specific plan area see figure 1 the users guide includes a description of the purpose and applicability of the design guidelines an overview of how to get started using the design guidelines a stepbystep summary of the design process and information on where to get additional help with the design guidelines the route 66 design guidelines are based on both glendoras history and its future vision a purpose and applicability of the design guidelines 1 the way in which land is developed and buildings are built or rehabilitated influences both the overall image of a community as perceived by residents and visitors and the attractiveness of a place to prospective and existing investors and businesses the glendora general plan land use element supports quality design throughout the community additionally the city of glendora relies on its project approval process to pursue excellence in architectural and overall project design  including development and redevelopment within the route 66 corridor 2 the purpose of the route 66 specific plan design guidelines therefore is to provide consistent design guidance for the development and redevelopment of the route 66 corridor that reflects the glendora communitys commitment to quality truetoglendora design and economic development to this end a driving intent of the route 66 specific plan design guidelines is to be userfriendly ie easy to find information and use of simple understandable language easy to implement by property owners small business owners investors design professionals city staff planning commission etc and wellillustrated to help articulate the design objectives for the route 66 specific plan area building using design guidelines building not using design guidelines 3 the guidelines will be used by city staff the planning commission and the city council in the review of proposed projects in compliance with requirements of the citys general plan and municipal guidelines are applicable to the following types of projects within the route 66 specific plan area a any construction requiring a building permit  b projectsuses requiring a discretionary zoning application such as a development plan review or conditional use permit  c any construction whether or not a building permit or zoning application is required that affects the exterior elevation of an existing building or structure eg replacing doors or windows  d a change in the exterior appearance of a building eg painting reroofing replacing siding or similar changes  and e a change in the use of an existing building that requires additional parking 4 during its review of applicable projects city staff the planning commission and the city council will use discretion in applying the various provisions in the route 66 specific plan design guidelines to specific projects it is not anticipated that each guideline will apply equally to every project in some circumstances one guideline may be relaxed to facilitate compliance with another guideline determined by the city to be more important in a particular case the overall objective is to ensure that the intent and spirit of the guidelines are followed and that the project respects its surroundings in terms of scale character and orientation b how to get started to most effectively get started using the route 66 design guidelines the following basic process is recommended step 1 read the route 66 design context section below for an understanding of general design priorities for the corridor step 2 the route 66 specific plan area is divided into the following 9 land use districts  barranca gateway  grand avenue commercial gateway  town center

determine the route 66 land use district in which your projects is located step 3 turn to the section of districtspecific design guidelines below that is written for the land use district in which your projects is located this section will provide you with specific design guidance that will help your projects be compatible with the character desired for your district step 4 once you have reviewed the districtspecific design guidelines review the areawide design guidelines section for guidance on a range of items that will help your projects be compatible with the design features desired for the entire route 66 corridor step 5 subsequent to completing steps 1 schedule a meeting with the glendora planning department to review your ideas identify processes and requirements ask questions and discuss potential issues solutions and approaches the department is more than happy to help you be a successful part of the route 66 corridor step 6 if you have any additional questions please call write or email the glendora planning department  2017  design context route 66 serves many important existing and envisioned roles in the glendora community it is a major transportation corridor an economic backbone of local businesses a symbol of a rich history and future promise and a place that many call home it is also a corridor in transition evolving from a collection of different types of development that occurred individually and incrementally reflecting the era in which they built to one that seeks to achieve more compatibility between adjacent uses and a strong design image that unifies the vernacular architecture that does and will always exist to achieve the communitys vision for a more vital and visually enhanced route 66 it is important that project designers both recognize the unique design context of the corridor and make specific efforts to enhance it the elements that help define the envisioned character of route 66 include  identifiable landmark buildings amidst understated buildings and signs   views to surrounding hills and mountains and connections to nearby natural resources   pedestrian scale environments within a larger autooriented environment   good quality development with a feeling of being handmade and truetoglendora to successfully maintain and strengthen the route 66 corridors existing character project designers will be required to integrate design features that support the citys efforts to preserve the authenticity of glendora and maintain an image of quality development following the route 66 specific plan design guidelines will help achieve this goal a common design principles while every project is unique each should demonstrate adherence to certain design principles that are central to enhancing the quality of the development along route 66 this section provides the basic design goals that each project is expected to addressbuilding upon the route 66 design context section above newlyconstructed projects will have a greater opportunity to address each of the design principles more fully while projects that involve additions or remodeling may be more limited in their ability to address each specific principle the following common design principles contribute to nurturing compatible relationships between new projects existing uses and future developmentall in an effort to help ensure that projects along route 66 are wellintegrated and demonstrate respect for glendoras unique character and sensitivity to the contextual influences of the area especially in terms of building scale and architectural design it is expected that all project proponents will strive to implement the principles outlined below to the greatest degree possible the information in this design guidelines manual will help in achieving this goal 1 high quality maintain a high level of expectation for quality development quality of development can be expressed in a variety of ways adherence to authentic architectural styles and details  the honest and simple use of materials and colors  the provision of useable open space plazas and courtyards  the concern for human scale and pedestrian orientation  and the use of landscaping to soften the otherwise hard surfaces of structures and pavement all projects are expected to achieve a high level of quality building of higher quality building of average quality 2 human scale develop buildings that include humanscale details pedestrian amenities and create new linkages between and within developments where possible glendora is a community that prides itself on its heritage as a city and the history of its people an important aspect of the route 66 corridor is to respond to the importance of people while also acknowledging the roles of transit and automobile transportation the extension of a human scale character throughout the route 66 corridor is a basic design principle to be addressed by all projects project proponents should demonstrate how the proposed project contributes to the goal of human scale development along route 66 building with many human scale qualities building with few human scale qualities 3 vernacular character protect the existing vernacular character of route 66 and promote diversity in new development the vernacular nature of existing development contributes to the unique identity of route 66 new projects are expected to promote a diversity of architectural style while maintaining continuity of scale pedestrian amenities patterns of open space and use of landscaping the guidelines accommodate a variety of architectural styles including mission revival  spanish colonial revival  art deco  moderne  craftsman  traditional storefront  and contemporary highway vernacular choosing which architectural style to use is in part a matter of personal choice keeping in mind both the existing architectural context and the desired architectural character defined in the districtspecific design guidelines through these design guidelines individual project designs should respond to the basic characterdefining features of each of these styles as described later in this document see the section on areawide design guidelines many architectural styles along route 66 contribute to a vernacular character 4 development character promote a consistent and coherent rhythm of structures and open spaces along the street edge the structures and the spaces and landscaping between them create a variety of physical environmentsrhythmsalong route 66 the desired character within the route 66 corridor varies depending upon the rhythms that exist or that are envisioned as described in each of the districtspecific design guidelines sections provided later in this document development character is achieved thoughtful provision and arrangement of front and side building setbacks location of structures plazas and courtyards outdoor dining areas pedestrian paseos and linkages view corridors and vistas to surrounding hillsmountains landscaped areas and other natural features and other details that when aggregated will create a positive rhythm along route 66 development character also entails protecting adjacent residential uses from the impacts of nonresidential development optimal development character created through a coherent rhythm of building design streetscape and open space unpleasant development character created through uncoordinated building design open space placement and miscellaneous streetscape  2017  districtspecific guidelines a barranca gateway 1

architectural theme iii full variable roof planes and building height is encouraged 14 parking garages a description parking garages once thought of as purely utilitarian structures that simply housed vehicles have begun to be recognized as structures that play vital roles in cities beyond places where vehicles are stored they contribute to the architectural character of their surroundings and can provide valuable commercial space at the ground floor level typical issues to be addressed in the design of parking garages relate to security for users and the need to integrate the parking garage from an architectural standpoint into its surroundings b site organization i where appropriate parking garages should incorporate ground floor retail adjacent to the public sidewalk ii a landscaped

least one or two sides of the stair tower should include glass running vertically the height of the tower elevators should be provided with glassback cabs and shafts vi stairs and elevators should be located adjacent to a street on the exterior of the structure where lobbies can be exposed to outside view e building design parking structures should be designed to help reduce the mass and scale of the garage and to ensure their compatibility with surrounding uses the following design guidelines should be implemented to the greatest extent feasible whenever they apply i conceal view of vehicles in the garage combination of screen walls and plantings ii design the garages exterior elevations to avoid a monolithic appearance this can be accomplished as follows a minimize horizontal and vertical banding by balancing both horizontal and vertical elements b use simple clean geometric forms and coordinated massing c step back upper levels of the garage d coordinate openings in the parking garage with the size and modulation of adjacent windows structural bays and storefronts if the parking garage contains other uses e use masonry materials that are predominantly light in color but avoid unpainted concrete f avoid a sloping ramp appearance by providing level and uniform spandrels g visually define and differentiate between pedestrian and vehicular entrances architectural detailing  2017  industrialbusiness park welldesigned industrial business park building a introduction the following design guidelines seek to assure high quality development in industrial and

space for these areas b recreational facilities such as jogging trails bicycle paths etc should be encouraged within industrialbusiness parks jogging trails and bicycle paths should connect with a regional or subregional bicycle path system provide small commercial services within industrialbusiness parks 6 natural features business parks should demonstrate an effort to retain significant existing natural features characteristic of the surrounding setting where possible existing vegetation waterways drainage courses views rock outcroppings and other natural features should be protected preserved and integrated into the development plan where feasible a all areas that are not paved or not covered by buildings should be retained in existing vegetation or landscaped b altered areas should be restored and revegetated to replicate the natural conditions prior to construction c mass grading that results in building sites separated by steep geometric slope embankments should be avoided contour grading should be employed to replicate preconstruction site conditions c parking and circulation guidelines the design of industrialbusiness park onsite circulation systems should address the needs of different user groups  visitors employees and truck loading and unloading 1 parking lots and cars should not be the dominant visual elements of the site large expansive paved areas located between the street and the building should be avoided in favor of smaller multiple lots separated by landscaping 2 parking lots adjacent to and visible from public streets should be screened from view use of rolling earth berms low screen walls changes in elevation landscaping or combinations thereof 3 optimize shade coverage of parking lots 4 the circulation system should be

pedestrian walkways within parking lots pedestrian walkways should be visually attractive d loading facility guidelines 1 location a to alleviate the unsightly appearance of loading facilities for industrial uses these areas should not be located at the front of buildings where it is difficult to adequately screened them from view such facilities are more appropriate at the rear of the site b when it is physically not possible to locate loading facilities at the rear of the building loading docks and overhead doors should be located along the side of the building 2 screening a loading facilities need to be sited with care on the industrial site whenever possible these facilities need to be screened from public view as much as possible b where screening is required by applicable development regulations a combination of elements should be used including solid masonry walls berms and landscaping c the method of screening should be architecturally integrated with the adjacent building in terms of materials colors shape and size screen all loading facilities e landscaping and lighting guidelines landscaping should be used to soften building exteriors 1 landscaping a

surrounding projects highmounted widely spaced pole fixtures that illuminate large areas from a single source are not appropriate b lighting fixture placement should provide the best illumination for outdoor areas such as parking shipping and receiving pedestrian walkways and work areas c the design of lighting fixtures and their structural support should be of a scale and architectural design compatible with onsite buildings if possible a light standard theme should be provided throughout the industrialbusiness park confine light spread to within the site boundaries f architectural guidelines unlike the general commercial design guidelines the guidelines for industrialbusiness park development seek not to impose strict scale and articulation guidelines but to promote high quality and creative development which will be an asset to the city these guidelines will assist the developer in understanding the citys concept of quality design relative to industrial and business park projects placing building not parking along industrial frontages is encouraged example of a quality industrialbusiness park building 1 general a each business park should have a distinct architectural concept that is consistent in theme but rich in subtle variation buildings within the same industrial park should be designed to provide a clear unified and easily identifiable image methods to achieve this include using similar architectural styles and materials complementary roof forms signage colors and decorative pavement b the architectural qualities and design elements for industrial buildings that are encouraged are i building modulation indentations and architectural details  ii building entry accentuation  iii screening of equipment and storage areas  and iv

developments are large in scale and tend to dominate their surroundings if not properly designed additionally issues of parking circulation open space site amenities and resident safety need to be addressed 2 the purpose of this section is to provide design guidelines that address the particular issues associated with multifamily developments the guidelines cover attachedtype dwellings in general including apartments condominiums and townhouses multifamily development exists and is planned for the central route 66 residential district of the specific plan area 3 the primary objective of the design guidelines in this section is to ensure quality development that will stand the test of time be safe and convenient for its residents and be compatible with the character of the city b general design objectives the design guidelines for multifamily developments are based on the following objectives 1 establish multifamily residential architectural designs that complement and that support high quality development 2 provide attractive functional and convenient site arrangements 3 identify landscape materials and designs that enhance the appearance of multifamily housing developments and contribute to the overall quality of the glendora community 4 provide for amenities appropriate to the different age groups of multifamily residential developments within an area 5 apply the principles of crime prevention design cpted to enhance safety and security within multifamily residential developments c site planning 1 context a new multifamily residential development should be compatible with other development in the immediate area use of complementary building arrangements buffers and avoidance of overwhelming building scale and visual obstructions b landscaping should complement existing landscape materials location and massing on adjacent developments 2 building and facilities location appropriate building siting can reduce the perceived density of multifamily developments maximize open space areas provide eyes on the street surveillance and enhance neighborliness by creating community gathering spaces dwelling units oriented to the street a the siting of buildings should consider the existing neighborhood context developments should generally be oriented parallel to the public street or to the developments internal streets with some setback variation to provide visual interest buildings sited to reinforce eyes on the street b the clustering of multifamily units should be a consistent site planning element whenever possible buildings should be configured around courtyards gathering areas and open spaces buildings are configured to form a centralized open space area for childrens outdoor play c buildings should be oriented to provide some privacy yet still relate to the street and the existing community doors should be visible from the street and windows should allow residents to have eyes on the street for natural surveillance doors and windows encourage eyes on the street d energy efficiency and energy conservation should be considered in building siting buildings should be oriented to take advantage of prevailing breezes whenever possible e where public transit is located near the development the site design should consider convenience and comfort factors for residents these include direct access widened sidewalks shaded seating areas and weather protection provided near public transit stops 3 open space common open space provides opportunities for casual social interaction and safe play areas for children and it reduces the perceived density of the development private open space serves as an outdoor room for residents and a protected play area for toddlers a residents should have access to useable open space for recreation and social activities open spaces should be conveniently located for the majority of units centralized open space provides convenient access for many units b open space areas should be sheltered from the noise and traffic of adjacent streets or other incompatible uses open space siting should take advantage of prevailing breezes and sun orientation in order to provide a comfortable environment c a series of connected open space areas of varying shape appearance and usage are encouraged smaller areas may directly relate to a cluster of units while the larger areas may serve several clusters as common open space large and small open spaces are connected private open space at rear of unit d boundaries between private and common open spaces should be clearly defined by low walls or plant materials e buildings should be sited and designed so that windows of neighboring units do not overlook private open spaces likely to be used for private activities f private open space should be provided adjacent to the units it serves and should be immediately adjacent to the public rightofway or common open space private open space adjacent to common open space 4 outdoor play areas onsite outdoor play areas can provide children with a safe and interesting environment and allow parents to easily view play areas in order to supervise play activities children especially those in the five to twelveyearold age group tend to play throughout the entire grounds of a development not just in designated play areas therefore their needs as well as maintenance requirements should be important design considerations a childrens play areas should be visible from as many units as possible and from private open space areas direct convenient access from ground level private open space to the communal play area is encouraged units with views and convenient access to the play area b outdoor play areas should be located adjacent to laundry rooms community centers or similar common facilities play areas should not be located near public streets parking or entry areas unless physically separated by appropriate walls fencing or dense landscaping c hard surface areas for outdoor activities eg bicycle riding skating rope jumping and hopscotch should be provided these active play areas should be safely separated from vehicular use areas d in larger developments separate but not necessarily segregated play areas or informal outdoor spaces should be provided for different age groups for safety reasons small developments may combine play areas eg a tot lot incorporated into a larger activity area for older children create separate play areas for the activities of younger and older children e seating areas should be provided where adults can supervise childrens play and also where schoolage children can sit seating location should consider comfort factors including sun orientation shade and wind 5 miscellaneous site elements a walls and fences i the design of walls and fences as well as the materials used should be consistent with the overall developments design fence and wall color should be compatible with the development and adjacent properties to facilitate quick removal of graffiti all wood fences should be painted paint color used on fences should be common colors readily purchased and kept readily available on the developments premises ii if front yard fences are provided visually penetrable materials eg wrought iron or tubular steel should be used penetrable wrought iron fences allow views low retaining walls in the front yard iii wall design and selection of materials should consider maintenance issues especially graffiti removal and longterm maintenance concrete capstones on stucco walls are encouraged to help prevent water damage from rainfall and moisture iv individual dwelling unit patio and rear yard fences and walls visible from the developments open space should be of a height not to preclude natural surveillance by residents into and out of these areas outdoor privacy walls between units however may be higher to increase privacy it is encouraged that the privacy walls be solid b site furniture i the design selection and placement of all site furnishings eg tables benches bollards and trash receptacles should be compatible with the overall site design and architectural character of the development ii seating opportunities should be provided in both sunny and shaded areas seating in areas that offer opportunities for social interaction and informal surveillance eg a bench near the communal mailbox area or benches near tot lot areas and laundry rooms are strongly encouraged a variety of sitting area designs from formal arrangements benches to informal arrangements low walls or steps are encouraged in general benches should be located in areas that have some provision for shade seating areas in a shaded location iii a drinking fountain located near each childrens play area is encouraged drinking fountains should be highlow to accommodate various age groups and disabled persons iv onsite trash receptacles should be located in or adjacent to high use areas eg community facilities play areas and laundry rooms c refuse storage areas i refuse storage areas should be located in convenient but not prominent areas such as inside parking courts or at the end of parking bays they should be well screened in compliance with requirements of the development trellis and gate screen the trash enclosure ii trash receptacles should be accessible for trash collection but should not block circulation drives near loading areas or conflict with parking for security reasons trash enclosure locations should not create blind spots or hiding areas d mailboxes i mailboxes should be located in highly visible heavy use areas for convenience to allow for casual social interaction and to promote safety a bench or seating area in close proximity to the mailbox location is strongly encouraged and a trash receptacle should be located adjacent to the mailboxes ii incorporation of design features such as a built frame consistent with the developments architectural style is encouraged a bench near the mailbox offers an opportunity to socialize e signs i signs contribute to the developments identity as a unique environment professionally designed creative signs are strongly encouraged especially for internal directions and building identification ii clear legible entry signs should be provided to identify the development internal circulation signs and visitor parking areas should also be clearly indicated a directory that shows the location of buildings and individual dwelling units within the development is encouraged iii building numbers and individual unit numbers should be readily visible in a consistent location well lit at night and compatible with the overall design of the development visible building numbers help visitors to easily locate units d architecture it is not intended that these guidelines designate a particular architectural style or a specific design character the primary focus should be to construct a high quality residential environment that is compatible with the surrounding community the architectural guidelines address the overall external appearance of the development including building forms details and proportions use of singlefamily residential design elements eg pitched roofs porches individual entries are recommended to reduce perceived density give identity to the development and its individual dwelling units add visual interest and be compatible with the context 1 general a architectural styles most appropriate to influence the design of multifamily developments within the specific plan areas include monterey craftsman mission revival and spanish colonial revival b to create a unified appearance all support buildings in the development eg laundry facilities recreation buildings carports garages and the management office should be compatible in architectural design with the rest of the development 2 building scale and height a buildings should incorporate smallerscale architectural forms such as bays recessed or projecting balconies and dormers to visually reduce the height and scale of the building and emphasize the definition of individual units architectural elements such as bay windows porches projecting eaves awnings and similar elements that add visual interest to the development are strongly encouraged b in order to scale down faades that face the street common open space and adjacent residential structures it may be desirable to set back portions of the upper floors of new multifamily buildings c varied building heights are encouraged both to provide visual interest and give the appearance of a collection of smaller structures building heights at the developments edge should be considered within the context of the projects surroundings the adjacent uses and the distance from adjacent buildings the developments building height should create a transition from the heights of adjacent existing residential development rather than form abrupt height changes height transition from existing onestory dwelling to new twostory development 3 faade modulation a boxy and monotonous faades that lack human scale dimensions and have large expanses of flat wall planes should be avoided architectural treatments such as recessed windows moldings decorative trim and wood frames should be used to add visual interest to the faade windows of varied shape size and placement are encouraged examples of various windows styles that create visual interest on a building b building faades that enclose stairwells should include residentialtype windows to reduce the visual bulk of the stairwell and enhance safety building faades enclosing elevator shafts should use architectural treatments to reduce the visual mass c to provide visual interest and avoid an identical appearance garage doors should incorporate some architectural detailing that is consistent with the overall developments architectural design such as patterned garage doors or painted trim 4 building entries a courtyard doors or gates used at building entries should be attractively designed as an important architectural feature of the building or development b individual entries should have a strong relationship with a fronting street internal walkway or courtyard as appropriate to the overall siting concept a transitional area from the public space or walkway to the private dwelling unit entry such as a porch steps or landscaped walkway should be provided c each dwelling units entry should be emphasized and differentiated elements such as porches stoops or roof canopies and detailing opportunities should be provided for residents to personalize their entry by providing ground level space or a wide ledge for potted plants a wide ledge creates opportunities to personalize the dwelling unit 5 stairs a minimize the number of second floor dwelling units served by a single flight of stairs where appropriate for the architectural style the stairway design should be open to allow for natural surveillance open stairways allow natural surveillance b where prefabricated metal stairs are used additional design features such as screen walls enhanced railings or accent colors should be used to enhance their appearance the additional design features should be consistent with the overall building design 6 building materials a the developments dwelling units community facilities and parking structures should be unified by a consistent use of building materials textures and colors exterior columns or supports for site elements such as trellises and porches should utilize materials and colors that are compatible with the rest of the development b building materials should be durable require low maintenance and be of comparable quality and image to what is used in the surrounding neighborhood frequent changes in building materials should be avoided 7 roofs a roof pitches and materials should appear residential in character and should consider the prevailing roof types in the neighborhood including flat roofs hipped or gabled roofs and mansard roofs the roof pitch for a porch may be slightly lower than the roof pitch of the main building b roof lines should be broken up and varied within the overall horizontal plane combinations of roof heights that create variation and visual interest are encouraged c carport roofs visible from buildings or streets should incorporate the roof pitch and materials of the main buildings 8 color a color should be used as an important design element in the developments appearance the predominant colors for the dwelling units and accessory structures should be natural or muted tones appropriate use of more than one predominant paint color is encouraged compatible accent colors are encouraged to enhance important building elements b the color of shadow patterns relief decorative trim and wood frames should be distinctive yet compatible with the overall building color c materials such as brick stone copper etc should be left in their natural colors such materials should not appear thin and artificial veneer should turn corners and avoid exposed edges veneer materials should turn corners and avoid exposed edges 9 mechanical equipment and vents a onsite mechanical equipment visible from buildings or a public street should be screened b roof flashing and vents exposed to public view should be painted to match adjacent surfaces or concealed in a manner consistent with the buildings appearance e landscaping landscaping serves many functions in a multifamily housing development plant materials can create unique identity visually connect areas soften the architecture provide shade and screen unattractive areas landscaping is important to site design and safetysecurity issues as it helps to define outdoor space and edges and can be used to discourage graffiti an attractive wellmaintained landscaped environment contributes to overall resident satisfaction in the development and it also enhances the appearance of the surrounding neighborhood 1 use of landscaping a landscape design and selection of plant materials are an important component in multifamily developments the developments budget should provide for quality landscaping design proper installation and plant sizes that will fill in and beautify the development within a reasonable period of time b use of landscaping is encouraged to define and accent specific areas such as building and parking lot entrances and the main walkways to community facilities c plant materials should be used to define the territorial edge between public and private space buffer adjacent uses when appropriate and screen service areas 2 landscape design a landscaped areas should generally use a threetiered planting system consisting of ground cover  shrubs and vines  and trees grass is a highmaintenance ground cover that should be used primarily for active recreation areas grass should not be used in narrow strip areas  groundcover or shrubs are more appropriate groundcover shrubs and trees help to create an attractive development b different landscape designs and plant materials should be used in the various courtyards and common open space areas of the development to create an individual identity for each space c landscape designs that emphasize waterefficient plants are encouraged waterintensive landscaping such as grass should be concentrated in areas of high visibility and use d vines and climbing plants on buildings trellises perimeter walls and fences are encouraged both to provide an attractive appearance and to minimize graffiti e landscape plantings should be used to help define property lines and distinguish private space from public space by creating a strong edge distinct change of plant material form height andor color f trees and shrubs should be selected based on their mature size and root characteristics plants with root systems that uplift hardscape materials should be avoided g landscape materials should be used to help screen trash enclosures and mechanical equipment so that they are not exposed to view from the street or major walkways within the development h trees and shrubs should not be planted so close together that they create maintenance and security problems at maturity they should not completely obstruct views into the development from the public rightofway especially views to dwelling entries and common open space areas i tree height and spread should consider the location of light standards in order to avoid conflicts and maintenance problems as the tree grows j the following are design concepts that are encouraged in all developments i use specimen trees and accent plant materials at major focal points such as the entry to the development or where major walkways intersect with the common open space area ii use landscaping to help define the edges of common open space areas and to distinguish the boundary between private and common open space areas iii use plantings to soften building lines and emphasize the positive features of the site use plantings to create shadows and patterns against walls iv use dense landscaping to physically separate childrens outdoor play areas from vehicular parking or entry areas v use trees to create canopy and shade especially in parking areas and passive open space areas trees with open branching structures and less dense foliage should be used to allow filtered views to parking lots for security purposes k hardscape materials should be consistent with the architectural design or style of the development the use of interlocking pavers scored concrete or roughtextured concrete to define site entries is strongly encouraged stamped concrete or colored concrete is not recommended due to excessive maintenance and repair costs associated with its use f parking and circulation safe and efficient parking and circulation arrangements take into consideration the needs of pedestrians children at play parking lot appearance and prevention of car theft or damage 1 parking a one large parking area where cars would dominate views and increase perceived density should be avoided parking areas should be divided into a series of small parking courts with convenient access that relates to adjacent dwelling units for security reasons dwelling units should have sight lines out to the parking areas but these views should be partially filtered of appropriate landscaping such as trees small parking courts with trees that filter views from dwelling units b parking areas should be located in the developments interior and not along street frontages parking areas should not compete with open space carports and tuckunder parking should not be visible from a public street c parking structures such as garages and carports should be located where they do not obstruct natural surveillance d entry drives should have an adjacent pedestrian entry path e special accents that define the main entry create territorial reinforcement and provide visual interest are strongly encouraged examples include architectural detailing specialty lighting textured paving a hardscape decorative border strip along the driveway and accent plant materials such as specimen trees and flowering plants entry drive with textured paving and border strip f carports detached garages and accessory structures should be designed as an integral part of the developments architecture they should be similar in material color and detail to the main buildings of the development if prefabricated metal carports are used architectural detailing consistent with the main building should be incorporated g parking courts should be well designed with consideration given to landscaping lighting building massing and pedestrianvehicular circulation h visitor and disabled parking should be clearly identified and distributed throughout the development to provide convenient access to groups of dwellings and community facilities i for convenience parking spaces should be assigned but the parking space numbering system should not identify the dwelling unit that is assigned to the space 2 pedestrian circulation pedestrian circulation provides safe efficient access to facilities and dwelling units for residents encourages opportunities for casual social encounters and allows natural surveillance by residents a convenient pedestrian connections should be provided to adjoining residential developments commercial projects and other compatible land uses b pedestrian access to adjacent existing or planned open space areas and corridors should be provided for the developments residents provide access to adjacent open space corridors c cross circulation between vehicles and pedestrians should be minimized a continuous clearly marked walkway should be provided from the parking areas to main entrances of buildings d walkways should be located to minimize the impact of pedestrians on the privacy of nearby residences or private open space avoid siting a walkway directly against a building a landscaped planting area between walkways and building faades is strongly encouraged e adequate lighting should be provided along all walkways 3 access to dwellings access to dwellings should provide a unique identity for the individual unit allow opportunities for social interaction and increase natural surveillance a the main entry to each dwelling unit should be clearly visible from the nearest public circulation walkway a porch covered stoop or similar entry feature should be provided at each units front entry individual private walkways lead to each ground level unit b stairwells should be centrally located to the units served and should be visible from as many units as possible c minimize the number of units sharing a common entry or stairway d to minimize the outdoor clutter that can accumulate in private open space areas private storage space for strollers bicycles etc should be provided for each dwelling unit its location should be either inside the unit or outside and immediately adjacent to the unit e walkways and access to dwelling units should be designed to facilitate the moving of furniture by considering minimum widths heights and turning angles g public safety through design residents have a basic right to feel safe and secure in their homes the following guidelines promote the use of site planning landscaping community involvement and physical and psychological barriers to create a safe environment and to prevent crime vandalism and graffiti the principles of crime prevention design cpted are used extensively the lighting guidelines are less detailed and recognize that specific illumination levels are dependent on the individual site characteristics 1 crime prevention through environmental design cpted the following cpted strategies should be incorporated into the design of multifamily developments whenever possible a use the concept of natural surveillance or eyes on the street by promoting features that maximize the visibility of people parking and building entrances b use the concept of territorial reinforcement by promoting features such as landscape plantings paving designs and gateway treatments that define property lines and distinguish private space from public space c use the concept of natural access control by designing streets walkways building entrances and development entries to clearly indicate public routes and to discourage access to private areas 2 opportunities for surveillance a windows and entries should be placed to maximize natural surveillance of the site sight lines from dwelling units to the parking area should be provided b open spaces courtyards circulation corridors and individual dwelling unit entrances should be designed to be visible from as many dwelling units as possible enclosure of private open space should not prevent common open space surveillance by residents c the management office should be located in a central visible location and community meeting rooms and other amenities should also be located close to other heavily used areas security is enhanced with a management office that is in a highly visible location d laundry rooms should be located adjacent to the childrens play area to facilitate supervision doors and walls should have windows to allow natural surveillance both into the laundry room and outside to the surrounding area a laundry room with windows allows open views out to the surrounding area 3 hierarchy of space a development design should use a hierarchy of space to define territory for public space streets community space common open space play areas communal laundry community center etc and private space individual units and private open space the use of design elements to define the publicprivate edge such as special paving change in building materials and grade separations or physical barriers such as landscaping fences walls screens or building enclosures are encouraged grade separation and low retaining walls establish a publicprivate edge and define b building entrances and individual dwelling unit entries should be accentuated by architectural elements lighting andor landscaping to further emphasize their private nature 4 access a doors to community facilities should contain some transparency and be keycontrolled by residents courtyard gates and shared building entrances that access individual units should automatically lock when closed b all front doors in individual dwelling units should have a peephole or other feature to allow residents to see who is at the door before opening it to prevent breakins doorknobs should be located beyond easy reach from any windowpane single cylinder dead bolt locks should be installed on the exterior doors of all individual dwelling units sliding glass doors should have one permanent door on the outside and the inside moving door should have a locking device and a pin c if security bars are provided they should be located only on the inside of windows and have proper emergency release mechanisms 5 lighting a lighting levels should vary depending on the specific use and conditions but the overall consideration should be to provide lighting levels sufficient that intruders cannot lurk in shadows steps and other grade changes are apparent residents can easily unlock their door or identify visitors on their doorstep and opportunities for theft and vandalism are eliminated b street lighting should be installed along the internal circulation streets lighting should be designed to shine downward and eliminate skyward glare light standards should be residentialpedestrian in scale and be spaced appropriately for the fixture type of illumination and pole height c lighting in parking areas should be arranged to prevent direct glare into adjacent dwelling units and onto neighboring usesproperties d pedestrianscaled lighting should be located along all walkways within the development lighting bollards should not be used as they do not illuminate large enough areas and are subject to vandalism light standards heights are recommended that concurrently allow proper illumination discourage vandalism and have a pedestrian scale site lighting may be located on buildings to illuminate site areas not covered by individual light standards  2017  architectural styles a mission revival 1 introduction a the following architectural styles are presented to encourage architectural diversity and quality within the route 66 specific plan area it is not the intent of this section to dictate preferences of architectural styles this section should be used by city staff and officials as well as project applicants to more effectively achieve the image envisioned for the route 66 specific plan area b as the name implies the mission style finds its roots in the architecture of the california missions in the late 1800s several innovative california architects began to advocate the mission style in a response to other revivalist movements taking place then on the east coast they chose as their inspiration local hispanic design elements and adapted these elements to adorn traditional building shapes whether residential or nonresidential the mission style found great impetus when the santa fe and southern pacific railroads adopted the style for their stations 2 characterdefining features a parapets with coping fashioned after the california missions b full pitched roofs over most of the building simple low pitch hip or gable roofs are preferred shed roofs may be appropriate when attached to taller walls minor portions of the roof may be flat c symmetrical faades are most common but asymmetrical designs are also acceptable d clay tiled roofs using twopiece tile of consistent color s type tile and multicolored tile are prohibited e simple boxlike massing with the appearance of thick walls windows and doors are recessed to expose thickness of walls f arched doors and windows with semicircular shapes preferred large windows are multipaned g arcades used to define courtyards and walkways h smooth plasterstucco walls with handtroweled finish i exposed timber structural elements for beams rafter tails and corbels color is dark stain j simple wrought iron grillework railings window grilles and decoration k quatrefoil windows on primary faade l tile accents used around door and window openings built in seating paving and general decoration m building colors are white offwhite or earth tone with contrasting door and window trim colors n larger structures may incorporate missionlike bell towers b spanish colonial revival the spanish colonial revival style borrows from the full range of spanish architecture beginnings of the style derive primarily from the panamacalifornia exposition of 1915 until that time missionstyle architecture was more popular the exposition showcased the richness of spanish and latin american architecture and trendsetting architects of the time found new inspiration in this style during the 1920s and 1930s 1 characterdefining features a simple lowpitched roofs are preferred shed roofs may be appropriate when attached to taller walls minor portions of the roof may be flat b asymmetrical faades are most common c multilevel clay tiled roofs using twopiece tile of consistent color s type tile and multicolored tile are prohibited d eaves with little or no overhang e simple boxlike massing with the appearance of thick walls windows and doors are recessed to expose thickness of walls f large windows are multipaned g arcades used to define courtyards and walkways h smooth plasterstucco walls with handtroweled finish i decorative masonry or tile vents j exposed timber structural elements for beams rafter tails and corbels color is dark stain k simple wrought iron grillework railings window grilles and decoration l tile accents used around door and window openings built in seating paving stairs and general decoration m building colors are white offwhite or earth tone with contrasting door and window trim colors n larger structures may incorporate round or square towers c monterey the monterey style is essentially a twostory adaptation of early spanish colonial styles as trade opened up the west coast anglo immigrants arrived in the territory with their own building traditions as these were superimposed on the traditional adobe construction the twostory versions came to be called monterey style after the colonial capital of california a revival of the style from 1925 to 1940 favored spanish detailing while versions from the 1940s and 1950s emphasize english colonial details because this style is always twostory and therefore may be larger in scale than adjacent buildings the monterey style should be used carefully and with appropriate consideration to the style and scale of surrounding buildings 1 characterdefining features a low pitched gabled roofs b secondstory balcony usually cantilevered and covered by main roof c clay tiled roofs d simple boxlike massing with the appearance of thick walls windows and doors are recessed to expose thickness of walls e large windows are multipaned f arcades used to define courtyards and walkways g smooth plasterstucco walls with handtroweled finish h exposed timber structural elements for beams rafter tails and corbels color is dark stain i wood grillework railings window grilles and decoration j staircases are fully enclosed k building colors are white or offwhite with contrasting door and window trim colors d art deco art deco architecture also gained prominence during the chicago tribune competition it preceded its counterpart art moderne and differs from it in a number of ways art deco buildings emphasize the vertical other projections faade details include decorative zigzags chevron and other geometric and stylized motifs 1 characterdefining features a smooth wall surface usually stucco  b decorative zigzags chevrons and other geometric motifs  c towers and other vertical projections give vertical emphasis e art moderne the art moderne style of architecture gained recognition in the early 1920s in conjunction with a worldwide competition to design the chicago tribune building in the moderne style one or more corners may be curved and it is common for windows to turn those corners these houses generally have smooth wall surfaces flat roofs and a strong horizontal emphasis detailing the use of glass block and small round windows is common moderne building 1 characterdefining features a smooth wall surface usually stucco  b flat roof with small ledge or coping at roofline  c horizontal grooves lines or balustrades offer horizontal emphasis  d asymmetrical faades most common f craftsman the craftsman style was inspired by the work of the greene brothers who practiced architecture in pasadena from 1893 to 1914 the craftsman style represented a philosophy of life that featured honesty integrity and a return to nature natural woods shingles earth colors brick stone river rock and heavy wooden beams signified a oneness with nature the rocks and bricks were often used on foundations chimneys foundations and railings to set a unifying theme oriental tudor and swissinfluenced elements lent variety to the style since the craftsman style is predominantly residential in character its use for commercial buildings should be approached cautiously this style is most appropriate for buildings that do not require large commercial display windows restaurants and office buildings are two examples 1 characterdefining features a lowpitched gable roof b clapboard or shingle siding c exposed timber structural elements rafter tails brackets corbels d large open porches with columns e square or tapered columns f overhanging eaves with exposed rafters g projecting bracketsbeams h large front windows usually in three parts i front door with sidelights j doors and windows outlined with heavy wood molding k colors are typically medium to dark earth tones g traditional storefront traditional storefront commercial architecture has its roots in american downtowns this style of architecture includes large display windows on the ground floor to allow people to see in and out of the building and one or more stories above to provide opportunities for accessory uses to occur above regardless of the period of american history in which a building was constructed this style of architecture includes three characterdefining elements the storefront  the upper faade  and the cornice while these elements are shared buildings falling within the traditional storefront architectural style may also possess thematic or stylistic traits of other architectural styles eg victorian etc 1 characterdefining features a the storefront is the groundlevel of the front faade containing large display windows with bulkheads or kick plates and often including transoms above the display windows b the upper faade which is the area above the groundfloor storefront opening typically contains both wall material ie brick wood or stucco and windows c the cornice provides a cap for the entire faade typically detailed in design and screening utilities on the roof d height and width of buildings are in proportion with surrounding buildings e proportional relationship exists between door and window openings creating a rhythm f human scale and typically abutting sidewalk h contemporary highway vernacularcontextsensitive contemporary highway vernacular architecture includes buildings that are used for selling products or services but are not of the pure architecture such as commercial buildings designed by famous architects they are generally easy to construct designed by industrial designers and are characterized by a main structure subservient to the signs upon the exterior this architectural style is based on a concept known as productplacepackaging wherein a business or franchise does not rely on creating a structure for a specific landscape but creates a fully internalized atmosphere that is identical across all the stores as a result this architectural style varies by business type and company  however a building fitting this style is typically built exactly or near exactly the same way in each location gas stations hotels and motels fast food establishments and drug stores provide the most common examples of contemporary highway vernacular architecture the aggregate of this architectural style has become known as the commercial strip large signs franchised organizations and large parking lots in many locales this type of architecture is regulated as formula businesses having to adhere to design guidelines and development standards which require conformance to more traditional architectural styles valued by the communityin an effort to move away from an anywhere usa image for the route 66 specific plan area contemporary highway vernacular architecture is encouraged so long as it demonstrates a high level of sensitivity to the envisioned architectural context for the planning area most franchises or corporate businesses will work with communities to modify their typical building design to better fit the local context 1 characterdefining features a main structure subservient to the signs upon the exterior  b internalized atmosphere that is identical across all the stores  c exterior easily recognized and identified with a certain company across all the stores  d surrounded by large parking areas  e often regulated to conform to locally supported traditional architectural styles  2017  public space amenities a site amenities form elements of commonality which help to establish the identity of a commercial area and provide comfort and interest to its users individual site amenities within a commercial setting should have common features such as color material and design to provide a cohesive environment and a more identifiable character private development is encouraged to include site amenities compatible with the route 66 specific plan streetscape furniture b seating is an important amenity that should be provided throughout commercial areas within the route 66 specific plan area seating in the public rightofway should coordinate with other streetscape furnishings c walls and fences are generally used for security purposes to define ownership to mitigate nuisances such as noise and to screen areas from public view walls and fences should be kept as low as possible while performing their functional purpose d landscaping should be used in combination with walls to soften the otherwise blank surfaces vines planted on walls are strongly encouraged to hide flat wall surfaces and to help reduce graffiti provide seating in a shaded area e pedestrian scale lighting is strongly encouraged the style and color of lighting should relate to the overall architectural design of the primary commercial structure f tree grates should occur along street edges and plazas where a continuous walking surface is needed grate sizes should be a minimum of four feet in diameter knockouts must be provided to enlarge the inside diameter for supporting a larger tree trunk as the tree grows g tree guards should extend vertically from tree grates and serve to protect trees in highly active areas tree guards should be narrow and painted in a similar color and relate to other site furnishings compatible tree grate and guard h bollards are intended to separate pedestrians from vehicular traffic areas and to light sidewalk surfaces bollard design should coordinate with other streetscape furnishings in locations where emergency access may be necessary removable bollards are encouraged bollards are encouraged to promote safety of pedestrians i trash receptacle design should coordinate with other streetscape furnishings j pots and planters should be located where pedestrian flow will not be obstructed k pots and planters should be durable and have natural color tones that compliment the adjacent structures pots should be clustered together and away from pedestrian flow l directories should be provided near pedestrian entrances of commercial centers to assist visitors in orienting themselves directories help customers find businesses m kiosks that serve as information booths andor shelter for small vendors are encouraged kiosks should be located where pedestrian flow will not be obstructed n bicycle racks should be selected that are durable and visually subdued based on their performance loop racks and ribbon bars are encouraged and should be sized according to parking requirements o the design of newspaper boxes should be consolidated into one rack the rack should be attractive on all sides and properly anchored newspaper racks should be designed as attractive public amenities p bus stops should be as transparent as possible to increase unobstructed visibility from the ground level up in all directions q visual features such as fountains should be incorporated into commercial developments to attract pedestrians popset fountains are increasingly popular visual fixtures in commercial developments  2017  signage a introduction signs are one of the most noticeable visual elements throughout the route 66 specific plan area not only do signs communicate something about the goods or services being offered at a particular establishment they also communicate something about the quality of the businesses and the image of the community as a whole taken together with other visual elements in the environment signs play a major role in how people perceive the citys image welldesigned signs that communicate their message clearly without attempting to compete for attention will help create a more pleasant visual environment with the route 66 specific plan area a good quality sign enhances the aesthetic character of the development the sign design guidelines are designed to help ensure quality signs that communicate their message in a clear fashion  however the guidelines are not strict sign standards as are found in the citys sign design guidelines may be interpreted with some flexibility in their application to specific signsprojects this is in recognition that not all guidelines may be workable or appropriate for each sign or project in some circumstances a particular guideline may be relaxed to facilitate compliance with another guideline determined by the city to be more important these decisions will be made on a casebycase basis the primary objective is to ensure that the overall intent of the design guidelines is followed is each case design guidelines ensure good quality signs b general design guidelines 1 sign legibility a use a brief message the fewer the words the more effective the sign a sign with a brief succinct message is simpler and faster to read looks cleaner and is more attractive evaluate each word carefully and if it does not contribute directly to the signs message it should probably be eliminated businesses with long names are encouraged to use a generic identification eg cleaners rather than force too much sign copy into the allowed sign area keep signs as simple as possible b ensure legibility an effective sign should do more than attract attention  it should communicate its message clearly usually this is a question of the readability of words and phrases the most significant influence on legibility is lettering style and spacing use the following guidelines to help ensure sign legibility i avoid hardtoread intricate typefaces typefaces that are difficult to read reduce the signs ability to communicate ii avoid spacing letters and words too close together crowding of letters words or lines will make any sign more difficult to read conversely overspacing these elements causes the viewer to read each item individually again obscuring the message lettering should not occupy more than seventyfive percent of the sign face avoid typefaces that are hard to read iii limit the number of lettering styles in order to increase legibility a general rule to follow is to limit the number of different letter types to no more than two for small signs and three for larger signs iv avoid faddish and bizarre typefaces such typefaces may look good today but soon go out of style the image conveyed may quickly become that of a dated and unfashionable business c use significant contrast if there is little contrast between the brightness or hue of the message of a sign and its background it will be difficult to read d avoid signs with strange shapes signs that are unnecessarily narrow or oddly shaped can restrict the legibility of the message if an unusual shape is not symbolic it will probably be confusing e use symbols and logos pictographic images will usually register more quickly in the viewers mind than a written message 2 location a signs should be designed to relate to the architectural features of the building on which they are located and create visual continuity with other storefronts in the same building and adjacent buildings b signs should be placed to indicate the location of access to a business signs should be placed at or near the public entrance to a building or main parking area to indicate the most direct access to the business c signs should be placed consistent with the proportions of the buildings faade for example a particular sign may fit well on an upper more plain wall but would overpower and obstruct the finer detail of a lower storefront area a sign appropriate near the buildings entry may look tiny and out of place above the ground level dont do this inconsistent sign patterns create confusion do this employ a consistent sign pattern d on buildings that have a monolithic or very plain faade proper sign placement can establish appropriate rhythm scale and proportion e signs should not be located so that they cover or interrupt the architectural details or ornamentation of a buildings faade f signs should not project above the edge of the rooflines and should not obstruct windows andor doorways 3 color a too many colors overwhelm the basic function of communication if they compete with content for the viewers attention limited use of the accent colors can increase legibility while large areas of competing colors tend to confuse and disturb limit colors to three on a single sign b contrast is an important influence on the legibility of signs the most aesthetic and effective graphics are produced when light colored letters and images are placed on a dark contrasting colored background light colored letters on contrasting background c colors or color combinations that interfere with legibility of the sign copy or that interfere with viewer identification of other signs should be avoided bright dayglo fluorescent colors should be avoided as they are distracting and do not blend well with other background colors avoid combinations of materials that camouflage the signs message d colors should relate to and complement the materials or paint scheme of the buildings including accent and trim colors 4 illumination a if the sign can be illuminated by an indirect source of light this is usually the best arrangement because the sign will appear to be better integrated with the buildings architecture light fixtures supported in front of the sign cast light on the sign and generally a portion of the face of the building as well indirect lighting emphasizes the continuity of the buildings surface and signs become an integral part of the faade conversely internally illuminated cabinet signs where only the sign face is illuminated tend to stand out and not appear integrated with the buildings faade internally illuminated signs are discouraged b individually illuminated letters either internally illuminated or backlighted solid letters reverse channel are a preferred alternative to internally illuminated plasticfaced cabinet signs signs comprised of individual letters will be better integrated with the building because they use the buildings faade as their background signs illuminated by an indirect source of light are encouraged c the use of backlit individually cut letter signs is strongly encouraged for all types of business and signs including monumenttype signs good example of a backlit sign that is easy to read d the use of internally illuminated cabinettype signs with translucent panels or panels with reflective surfaces including but not limited to acrylic fiberglass plastic or metal is strongly discouraged and the sign their use for monumenttype signs if internally illuminated cabinet signs are used for wall signs their sign panels should be opaque so that when illuminated only the lettering

source to prevent glare from spilling over into residential areas and public rightsofway backlit letter signs are encouraged 5 materials a sign materials should be selected with consideration for the architectural design of the buildings faade sign materials should compliment materials used on the building and should also contribute to the legibility of the sign for example the glossy finishes used on most cabinet signs are often difficult to read because of glare and reflections b sign materials should be extremely durable paper and cloth signs are not suitable for exterior use because they deteriorate quickly if wood is used it should be properly sealed to keep moisture from soaking into the wood and causing the signs lettering to deteriorate avoid materials that cause glare and make the sign hard to read select materials that are durable avoid cloth and other nondurable materials 6 electrical raceways and conduits a electrical transformer boxes and raceways should be concealed from public view if a raceway cannot be mounted internally behind the finished exterior wall the exposed metal surfaces of the raceway should be finished to match the background wall or integrated into the overall design of the sign b if raceways are necessary they should be as thin and narrow as possible and should never extend in width or height beyond the area of the signs lettering or graphics c all exposed conduit and junction boxes should be concealed from public view c design guidelines for specific sign types 1 wall and building signs a a wall sign should be located where architectural features or details suggest a location size or shape for the sign the best location for a wall sign is generally a band or blank area between the first and second floors of

appearance for the center place signs where architectural features suggest a location wall signs of consistent size and placement are encouraged c lettering should not occupy more than about seventyfive percent of the area of the sign to avoid a cluttered look and to help maintain the readability of the sign d wall signs should not project from the surface upon which they are attached more than the required for construction purposes e internallyilluminated cabinettype signs are strongly discouraged internallyilluminated individuallycut channel letters are preferred 2 projecting signs a the use of pedestrianoriented projecting signs is strongly encouraged b projecting signs should be used for ground floor uses only c projecting signs should ensure clearance for pedestrians d

lone hill avenue and sunflower avenue all these roadways intersect with the i210 i10 or both important eastwest arterials in the project area include from south to north badillo streetcovina boulevard arrow highway gladstone street baseline road route 66 and foothill boulevard badillo streetcovina boulevard arrow highway baseline road route 66 and foothill boulevard are classified as primary roads acting as regional arteries that run residential and commercial areas badillo streetcovina boulevard and arrow highway provide access to the i210 planned eastwest access to the diamond ridge site will be via lone hill avenue glendora marketplace shopping center directly south of the foothill freeway located adjacent to lone hill avenue is a park and ride facility operated by the california department of transportation c existing physical conditions 1 topography the diamond ridge specific plan site is essentially flat sloping to the southwest minimum elevation on the site is eight hundred thirtyfive feet above mean sea level amsl in the southwestern corner of the property the northeastern corner of the site reaches a maximum height of eight hundred fiftyfive feet amsl 2 hydrology the water table in the main glendora groundwater basin has been lowered over the years water production to where it is now one hundred to three hundred feet below the surface neither natural watercourses nor open bodies of water exist on the project site runoff from the site will be conveyed via manmade drainage structures 3 soils soils present in a majority of glendoras valley area and the project site fall within the hanford association of soils the soils of this association occur on gently sloping alluvial fans between elevations from near sea level to three thousand five hundred feet hanford soils are over sixty inches deep are well drained and have moderately rapid subsoil permeability they have pale brown coarse sandy loam surface layers about eight inches thin underlain by light yellowish brown coarse sandy loam and coarse gravelly loam sand substratum excavation limitations of soils in the majority of the city and thus the project site are considered slight meaning there is a general absence of cobbles stones or a water table which could significantly affect excavation and construction activities subsidence andor expansive soils are not known geologic hazards which may affect the project site 4 seismicity generally it can be anticipated that any development in southern california will have the potential to be adversely impacted by seismic activity the degree to which the development is impacted is dependent on numerous variables such as but limited to distance to the nearest active fault bedrock structure water content in the soil and type and quality of construction materials it is anticipated that the site has the potential to be impacted by seismic events throughout the life of the project overall southern california is part of the most seismically active region in the united states seismic activity associated with regional fault zones has been the source of large historic earthquakes and is likely to be the source of future earthquakes that will affect development in the city the san andreas elsinore newportingelwood and san fernando faults generated m6+ earthquakes in 190 191 1933 and 1971 notable historic earthquakes

feature in the city is the sierra madre fault zone which branches along the foot of the san gabriel mountains the san fernando fault zone is now considered potentially active meaning that group rupture could occur along the systems surface traces the diamond ridge specific plan site would be exposed to seismic activity during any future seismic event on the sierra madre fault system lower groundwater level caused by domestic water production has reduced the potential for seismically induced liquefaction and subsidence in the area 5 wildlifevegetation the original natural state of the site has been modified by agricultural uses the project site consists of undeveloped fallow fields covered with lowlying nonnative vegetation consisting primarily of perennial weeds grasses and shrubs a few mature trees are scattered about the site the site does not harbor any rare or threatened plant species because of the disturbed nature of the site the majority of the animal species expected to reside on the site are mammals and birds that can tolerate close human contact no notable or threatened species of animal has been identified on the site 6 climate the project site has a moderate climate with warm to hot summers and generally mild winters the strength and location of a semipermanent subtropical highpressure cell over the pacific ocean strongly influences the areas climate climate is also affected by the moderating effects of differential heating between the land area of california and the adjacent pacific ocean warm to hot summers mild winters limited precipitation moderate daytime onshore breezes and moderate humidities characterize local climate conditions although annual and seasonal fluctuations are common the climate of the project area is generally pleasant the annual average daily maximum temperature is seventysix degrees while the average minimum is fortyseven degrees precipitation is seasonally variable summers are often completely dry with frequent periods of up to five months with no rain in winter an occasional storm from high latitudes may sweep across the coast bringing rain annual rainfall is lowest in the coastal plain and inland valleys higher in the foothills and higher in the mountains annual precipitation averages approximately eleven inches ninetyfive percent of which occurs november wind patterns in glendora are similar to those in the remainder of the basin during the day the onshore flow reaches inland across the coastal plain winds are generally from the west and have average speed of thirteen miles per hour during the night surface radiation cools the air in the surrounding mountains and hills the air then flows into the valleys and meanders to the coast producing a gentle land breeze during the summer the nighttime land breeze nearly disappears conversely the daytime sea breeze is weaker and of shorter duration in the winter santa ana winds are occasional winds blowing from the northeast between the months of october and march d existing utilities 1 water the city of glendoras water division will provide water service for the diamond ridge specific plan site the water division obtains sixtyfive percent of its water from three local underground basins the upper san gabriel basin the main san gabriel basin and the glendora basin this groundwater withdraw is supplemented by water

development of the project site infrastructure master plans address the potential for development of the various planning areas within the site the following sections describe the backbone infrastructure systems required to serve the project site a utilities 1 water facilities water service to the diamond ridge specific plan site will be provided by the city of glendoras water division the water division obtains sixtyfive percent of its water from three local underground basins the upper san gabriel basin the main san gabriel basin and the glendora basin this groundwater supply is supplemented by water purchases from the metropolitan water district mwd three valleys municipal water district water lines within adjacent streets include a fourteeninch water main in gladstone street and a sixinch water main in valley center avenue the valley center avenue water main will not be used for the diamond ridge development given the size of the existing water main adequate capacity and water pressure will be available for the project site including average daily and peak daily use and fire flows based on maximum building area land use and water consumption factors it is estimated that the proposed project will require one hundred twentyfour thousand nine hundred eighty gallons of water per day gpd average with a peak of three hundred twelve thousand four hundred fifty gallons per day the water system for the project site will be designed to deliver a minimum of four thousand gallons per minute per los angeles county fire department lacfd fire flow requirements for fully sprinkled buildings this flow is greater than that which is needed to accommodate the domestic water demands of the land uses proposed within the project site all buildings within the specific plan area will be provided with fire sprinkler systems the placement of hydrants and other fire suppression facilitiesdevices shall conform to lacfd standards water will be provided on site via the looped system the primary loop will connect to an existing fourteeninch line within gladstone street  the sixinch line within valley center avenue will not be used but a new sixteeninch main on valley center avenue will be available the water supply required by the proposed development will be provided by additional purchases from the mwd as is the case for all new development in the city mwd has indicated that as long as population increases within the city are within southern california association of governments scag projections the city will be able to purchase additional water to serve additional development because the project site has long been planned and zoned for commercial use the proposed projects water requirements will be adequately met by water purchases from mwd all onsite water lines will be located within public utility easements and will be maintained by the city of glendoras water division all water system improvements needed to serve the project site will be constructed by the developer 2 wastewater facilities los angeles county sanitation district lacsd no 22 serves the entire eastern san gabriel valley area including the city of glendora and the project site this agency is responsible for conveying sewage to regional treatment plants providing sewage treatment and disposing of effluent and solids the existing sewer mains in lone hill avenue and gladstone street are maintained by lacsd no 22 the project developer will pay for the cost and installation of all sewer lines needed to serve the site wastewater from the proposed project will discharge from an onsite sewer system into lacsd sunflower trunk sewer which is located in gladstone street this fifteeninch diameter trunk has a peak capacity of five million two hundred thousand gallons a day mgd and conveyed a peak flow of 08 mgd when last measured in 1996 additional sewer structures include an eightinch sewer line in valley center avenue the project developer will obtain appropriate permits to connect to the existing fifteeninch trunk line on gladstone street if there is not an existing lateral serving this site then the main will need to be saddled a permit will be required from both the sanitation district and the city the wastewater generated by the proposed project will be treated at the san jose creek water reclamation plant wrp located adjacent to the city of industry this facility has a design capacity of one hundred million gallons per day mgd and is currently processing ninety mgd this facility currently has a tenmgd surplus capacity wastewater flows which exceed the capacity of the san jose creek wrp and all sludge are diverted to and treated at the joint water pollution control plan jwpcp located in the city of carson based on an average rate of four thousand one hundred sixtysix gallons per acre the project site will generate approximately one hundred twentyfour thousand nine hundred eighty gallons of wastewater per day peak wastewater flows will average three hundred twelve thousand four hundred fifty gallons per day based on a peaking factor of two and onehalf the size sewer line required for new development is regulated by los angeles county department of public works lacdpw lacdpw determines pipe size based on a formula which factors the size and slope of the area to be served based on lacdpw standards eightinch sewer lines will be constructed all buildings located within the diamond ridge specific plan will be connected to the existing fifteeninch line in gladstone street 3 storm drains the construction of structures and parking areas within the project site will increase the amount of impermeable surfaces resulting in reduced absorption rates and increased surface runoff storm flows from the project site have been estimated at one hundred cubic feet per second cfs during a tenyear storm event and one hundred eightyfive cfs during a one hundredyear storm event onsite storm drain facilities will ultimately convey flows to the southwest corner of the project site where it will drain to the existing sixtysix inch rcp in gladstone street to be verified upon final civil submittal there are no offsite contributions to project storm runoff stormwater flows shall be metered where the onsite storm drain system connects to the sixtysix inch gladstone street line depending on where connection is along gladstone street is determinant to whether it is a sixtysix inch rcp or sixtynine inch rcp  subject to field verification to limit peak flows to eightyfive cfs per the 1964 bond issue hydraulic system as noted above ten and one hundredyear surface runoff generated by the proposed site will exceed this allocation thus onsite stormwater detention is required a system of buried thirtysix inch maximum pipes will be installed to temporarily detain storm flows in excess of the eightyfive cfs allowed figure 32 this detention facility will be installed in the center of the project site east of the proposed building area along the west edge of the site the capacity of this proposed facility will total approximately one hundred twentytwo thousand cubic feet cf of storage the stormwater detained in this facility will be discharged at a time and in a manner that will not exceed the eightyfive cfs allocated to the project site manhole access to this detention facility will be provided to allow for ongoing maintenance storm drain facilities within the gladstone street rightofway will be maintained by the lacfcd while onsite storm drains detention facilities and storm drain inlets will be maintained by the project owner 4 solid waste disposal the city of glendora contracts with a private company athens disposal service for refuse collection and

front setback of such property with appropriate path of travel sidewalk area to meet ada requirements b project access primarily access to the project site will be proved by westerly extension of the primary eastwest internal roadway drive aisle serving the adjacent glendora marketplace secondary access will be via access along gladstone street approximately six hundred sixty feet east of valley center avenue aligned across from shellman avenue project signage along the foothill i210 freeway will be designed to emphasize the lone hill avenue access point secondary monument signs will be placed at the entrance along gladstone street to allow access traffic from sunflower avenue and traffic overflow from lone hill avenue as noted above physical configurations of the proposed gladstone street driveway aligned with shellman avenue allows access truck traffic shall follow the routes established in figure 38 internal circulation will be a continuation of the eastwest drive cut from the glendora commercial center the internal drive which begins as a fourlane drive and then narrows down to two lanes will gradually transfer circulation from an eastwest to a northsouth movement a secondary twolane drive will travel northsouth both circulation drives will provide access to each of the main parking areas both the ongrade parking as well as the parking structure c grading the proposed project will result in changes to topography and ground surface features the current blend of nonnative vegetation and perennial weeds will be removed during grading operations for the thirtyacre site a significant portion of the site will be covered with building pads andor parking areas onsite grading will require eighty thousand cubic yards to be verified upon final grading of

southern california as shown in exhibit 1 regional location map and exhibit 2 local vicinity map the city of glendora is generally located twentyone miles northeast of downtown los angeles and is bounded by the cities of azusa to the west covina to the south and san dimas to the east as well as unincorporated portions of los angeles county exhibit 1 regional location map exhibit 2 local vicinity map b the 276acre specific plan site lies within the southwest portion of glendora the site is bordered on the south by the mta railroad rightofway singlefamily detached residential and the rain bird manufacturing facility  on the west by north barranca avenue monrovia nurseries operations and singlefamily detached residential  on the north by singlefamily detached residential la fetra elementary school and sandburg middle school and on the east by north grand avenue singlefamily detached residential and commercial uses as shown on exhibit 4 existingsurrounding land use access to the site from the surrounding region is provided by the 210 freeway via grand avenue  exh a 2006  project overview the arboreta community concept would transform the current manufacturingresearch and development uses on the site into a gated residential community with approximately one hundred forty homes on 276 acres primary access will be provided from grand avenue planned residential uses account for the majority of the community approximately 216 acres of the total 276 gross acre site with the balance being improved as a linear public park along the entire southern boundary and mta rightofway approximately sixteen existing oak trees in the central portion of the site will be preserved in a 14acre passive open space area the product mix includes fiftythree singlefamily detached homes on average four thousand six hundred squarefeet lots and floor plans ranging from two thousand two hundred ninetyeight square feet to two thousand five hundred fortyeight square feet in size twentysix of the fiftythree singlefamily detached homes fortynine percent are single story homes in addition the product mix also includes eightyseven attached homes included in twentynine townhome buildings small interior residential neighborhoods will be accessed from an eastwest local theme street providing direct access to detached homes and private drives for the triplex townhomes the appearance of the townhomes will be that of a large singlefamily estate home and provide enhanced elevations as viewed from offsite the townhome units include floor plans ranging from one thousand three hundred thirtyfive squarefeet to one thousand nine hundred twenty squarefeet in size the gross density of the specific plan is 51 unit per acre including the linear public park as previously mentioned a 46acre linear park is planned along the southern boundary of the site the park land would help serve as a connecting link from foothill and grand to barranca and the monrovia nursery properties included in the linear park will be a twelvefoot multipurpose trail and associated exercise stations all park design and improvements would be installed by the developer and maintained by the arboreta hoa  exh a 2006  community outreach community outreach provides residents and interested parties an opportunity to review and comment on the project work collaboratively with the developer and provide input on solutionsmitigations of perceived and identified impacts this outreach is an important component of the arboreta specific plan community ascertainment a series of thirdparty interviews with key community stakeholders was conducted to gain a preliminary idea of the neighborhood issues and concerns interviews were conducted with adjoining residents residents in leadership roles from la fetra elementary school and sandburg middle school as well as the schools principals and school district officials given the proximity of the schools to the project additional meetings were held during the public review process including the scoping session for the environmental impact report as well as outreach meetings with various neighborhoods to provide information on the plan and solicit further input prior to the public hearing process  exh a 2006  specific plan document organization the arboreta specific plan defines a vision and establishes guidelines for the development of the site the basic approach for preparing this specific plan has been to recognize the interrelationship between land use design regulation and sound economic market and financial considerations it should be noted that all statistics acreage densities etc have been rounded to the tenth the specific plan is arranged into seven articles as follows executive summary this chapter includes a discussion on the intent and purpose of the specific plan the authority and scope a description of the site location the project objectives and an overview of the project planning context this chapter provides a summary of the existing conditions affecting the specific plan area including existing city land use designations existing and surrounding land use discussion and a summary of the existing infrastructure within the project area specific plan elements forming the core of the specific plan document this article presents the land use plan for the project including proposed land use designations and discusses the proposed circulation grading and infrastructure of the land use plan development standards this article specifies the permitted and conditionally permitted uses in the proposed land use designation and specifies standards for development such as lot coverage building height setbacks etc design guidelines details a creative yet flexible set of guidelines and design criteria for site planning architecture and landscaping these provide direction for streetscape improvements project identification hardscape elements and architectural guidelines implementation this article contains provisions for the financing and maintenance of improvements a process for implementation of this specific plan and procedures for amending the specific plan  exh a 2006 planning context  jurisdictional considerations a general plan the city of glendora general plan designations for the site are partially light industrial li and partially industrial park ip these designations are intended to encourage general industrial and industrial park uses including light manufacturing assembly fabricating and warehousing a general plan amendment to medium density residential will be processed concurrently with the specific plan the project proposes a gross density of 51 dugross ac which would be included in the general plan designation of medium residential the medium density category allows for multiplefamily attached housing and a variety of housing types including townhomes duplexes patio homes and singlefamily detached homes upon approval the arboreta project site will be subject to the design guidelines and development standards contained in this document as adopted or amended b parks master plan in november 200 the city of glendora prepared a new parks master plan to assess the adequacy of existing park facilities and to project the need for new facilities based on existing deficiencies and future growth the rain bird property was identified to potentially provide a five to seven acre park land dedication c zoning site is currently zoned limited industrial m1a and industrial park ip under the citys zoning code these designations generally allow for a range of manufacturing uses a zone change to specific plan sp will be processed concurrently with the application package a rezoning from limited industrial and industrial park to specific plan will be required in order to implement the project the specific plan designation will allow singlefamily and multifamily residential units at an overall density of 51

by the city of glendora water system which has facilities directly adjacent to the site the existing water distribution system includes a teninch water main in grand avenue and a sixinch water main in bennett avenue additionally an eightinch water main traverses the site starting at grand avenue and continuing westerly to vacated valencia street and then extending along the vacated street area connecting to the existing eight inch water main in bennett avenue 2 sewer an eightinch public sewer line exists in the specific plan area and is available to provide service to the project 3 drainage in the predevelopment condition the specific plan area is divided into two distinct drainage areas which for the purpose of the study are referred to as the west basin and the east basin both basins are comprised of natural and improved areas as depicted on exhibit 11 conceptual drainage plan existing the improved impervious areas consist of the rain bird corporations headquarters a manufacturing facility and associated paved parking areas driveways and pathways these improved areas encompass approximately seven acres of the 276acre specific plan area or twentyfive percent this partially accounts for the minimal increase in runoff from the predeveloped to postdeveloped condition as summarized on exhibit 11a post development hydrology a los angeles county flood control district facility known as hook canyon channel crosses the central portion of the site from north to south within an easement along the alignment of vacated valencia street the facility as it crosses the property is an underground ten feet by seven feet reinforced concrete box culvert the hydrology study for hook canyon channel indicates that all but a small portion of the west side of the specific plan area is planned to drain into the facility generally rainfall runoff from both the west and east basin areas sheet flows southerly off of the property onto the north half of the at & sf railroad rightofway runoff from the east basin flows westerly within the railroad and is intercepted by hook canyon channel near the center of the property runoff from the west basin area flows westerly within the railroad and is intercepted by an existing storm drain facility in barranca avenue since the railroad rightofway presently accepts and conveys runoff from the specific plan area and since the railroad rightofway will continue to contribute runoff to both hook canyon channel and the barranca storm drain postdevelopment the acreage of the north half of the railroad rightofway has been included in the study  exh a 2006  opportunities and constraints the land use plan presented in specific plan elements was designed to incorporate existing physical site opportunities and constraints

current officeresearch and development uses the land use concept shown in exhibit 5 provides an overall vision and guide for the ultimate development of the site the design approach includes a more compatible land use with the existing residential community than the industrial designation in the general plan and zoning the architectural design and residential uses would upgrade the character of the surrounding residential area and help buffer existing noise impacts from the adjacent mta railroad rightofway to existing residences and schools north of bennett avenue and provide urgently needed housing the plan proposes a gated community creating a blend of residential product types in a pedestrianfriendly environment a 14acre oak tree preservation area is included in the center of the site offering passive recreation opportunities a private neighborhood pool area is located within the triplex area to serve the active recreational needs of the new arboreta community a tot lot located on

project to add a three and onehalf million gallon reservoir at the city yard site to serve zone 1 with completion expected to take one to one and a half years for the new reservoir water system demands for the project will include domestic demand and fire suppression demand typical average daily demand for domestic uses in the city of glendora is one hundred gallons per person per day typical maximum daily demand for domestic uses is one hundred eightyfive gallons per person per day using the specific plan areas proposed one hundred forty dwelling units at an estimated 301 persons per dwelling unit the maximum daily demand for potable water for the proposed project is expected to be seventyseven thousand nine hundred fiftynine gpd in preliminary discussions the city has indicated that zone 1 is presently capable of supplying the demand for the project at this time there is not a source of reclaimed water for landscape irrigation purposes in the city of glendora fire suppression flows are determined by the los angeles county fire department which is the fire authority in the city of glendora the typical flow requirements for the proposed residential uses are one thousand two hundred fifty gallons per minute at a twenty psi residual the existing water distribution system in the vicinity of the specific plan area consists of a teninch water main in grand avenue a sixinch water main in bennett avenue from grand avenue west to valencia street an eightinch water main in bennett avenue from valencia street west to a point easterly of barranca avenue where it reduces to a sixinch water main and continues west connecting to an eightinch water main in barranca avenue in addition an eight inch water main traverses the specific plan area starting at grand avenue and continuing property westerly to vacated valencia street and then north along the vacated street area connecting to the existing eightinch water main in bennett avenue this waterline currently provides service to the existing commercial and industrial uses on the property but due to its location would not be useful to the project and will be abandoned and removed as part of the development as a part of the specific plan area development a new water distribution system designed to the standards and specifications of the city of glendora will be constructed within the proposed streets glendora typically operates and maintains systems constructed to its required specifications it is intended that the water system for the specific plan area be designed and constructed as such and ultimately turned over to the city of glendora for maintenance easements will be granted to the city over the private streets and private lot areas as needed to allow for the existence of water mains and their operation and maintenance the approximate location of the water system for the proposed development is shown on exhibit 9 exhibit 9 conceptual water plan b sewer an eightinch public sewer line exists within the specific plan area and is available to provide service to the proposed project the existing line lies within an easement of the city of glendora that was reserved at the time the portion of valencia street within the property was vacated by the city the line runs south from bennett avenue subject property under the mta railroad rightofway and into existing valencia street south of the railroad the line continues south in valencia street to foothill boulevard where it connects to an existing trunk line the new sewer system within the project will be designed and constructed to conform to the requirements of the city of glendora and the los angeles county department of public works and will be maintained by the consolidated sewer maintenance district of los angeles county easements for the existence and maintenance of the sewer system will be granted to the city of glendora over the private streets and lots within the project as necessary underground pipelines to a joint outfall system convey sewage flows from the city of glendora this system directs flows to the san jose creek water reclamation plant in the city of industry los angeles county

previous plans in the proposed drainage plan exhibit 11 existing hydrology exhibit 11a postdevelopment hydrology exhibit 11b conceptual drainage plan 1 predevelopment condition in the predevelopment condition the specific plan area is divided into two distinct drainage areas which for the purpose of the study are referred to as the west basin and the east basin both basins are comprised of natural and improved areas as depicted on exhibit 11 existing hydrology the improved impervious areas consist of the rain bird corporations headquarters a manufacturing facility and associated paved parking areas driveways and pathways these improved areas encompass approximately seven acres of the 276acre specific plan area or twentyfive percent this partially accounts for the minimal increase in runoff from the predeveloped to the postdeveloped condition summarized on exhibit 11a post development hydrology a los angeles county flood control district facility known as hook canyon channel crosses the central portion of the site from north to south within an easement along the alignment of vacated valencia street the facility as it crosses the property is an underground ten foot by seven foot reinforced concrete box culvert the hydrology study of hook canyon channel indicates all but a small portion of the west side of the specific plan is planned to drain into the facility generally rainfall runoff from both the west and the east basin areas sheet flows southerly off the property onto the north half of the mta railroad rightofway runoff from the east basin flows westerly within the railroad and is intercepted by the hook canyon channel near the center of the property runoff from the west basin area flows westerly within the railroad and is intercepted by an existing storm drain facility in barranca avenue since the railroad rightofway presently accepts and conveys runoff from the specific plan area and since the railroad rightofway will continue to contribute runoff to both the hook canyon channel and the barranca storm drain postdevelopment the acreage of the north half of the railroad rightofway has been included in the study 2 post development condition onsite storm drain facilities will be designed to conform to an approved hydrology study and generally according to the proposed drainage plan shown on exhibit 11b the conceptual drainage plan for the proposed project includes interior streets fully improved with curbs gutters and paving that will be used as mechanisms to convey runoff flows to a storm drain system consisting of catch basins and pipes placed at strategic locations within the streets runoff from the proposed lots will drain to the adjoined street via graded swales or to acceptable drainage device such as a yard drain or pipe the proposed onsite storm drain systems will tie directly to the existing hook canyon channel and barranca avenue storm drains onsite storm drain facilities will either be maintained by the project homeowners association as private facilities or turned over to los angeles county flood control district for maintenance via the miscellaneous transfer drain mtd process the facilities will be designed and constructed in conformance with the standards of both the flood control district and the city of glendora all required easements for access and maintenance would also be provided as a part of the mtd process the design will also include the preparation and implementation of a standard urban stormwater mitigation plan susmp for compliance with the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes postdevelopment flows can be expected to exceed the predevelopment flows due to possible increases in the percentage of impervious surfaces after development slight variations in the tributary area to the particular facility and due to changes in the calculation methods and criteria between now and the time when the existing storm drain facilities were constructed the increase in the peak flows due to these factors will be mitigated by onsite detention in a manner satisfactory to both the city of glendora and the county of los angeles public works departments d utilities provisions for electrical natural gas telephone and cable television services will be made prior to the development of the specific plan area all services are available and can

undertaken the lead role in preparing this specific plan for the eventual development of property commonly referred to as the monrovia nursery this property is located in west central glendora on approximately 95 acres this specific plan governs only the 95acre property formerly occupied by the monrovia nursery operations however in the course of implementation it is certain that some infrastructure improvements circulation drainage will occur outside of the specific plan the specific plan appears as two large undeveloped parcels one on the north adjacent to sierra madre avenue and one on the south adjacent to the burlington northern santa fe railroad rightofway these are being referenced as specific plan  north and specific plan  south b the plan calls for the development of 124 minimum 20000 square foot detached singlefamily residential lots  all lots will be served by public water and sewer all parcels will be accessed by public streets with the exception of five lots and an existing home at 1326 west sierra madre avenue which will be served by a private drive  2 exh a 2011  the specific plan a specific plan was chosen for this project to provide a document that applies development requirements for the property that are not possible application of the city of glendora zoning in general a specific plan provides the regulations for the construction of new homes grading and access open space and a comprehensive infrastructure plan and utilizing development standards and guidelines attuned to the setting to assure that new development fits the community character the development standards and guidelines contained herein govern placement size style level of detail landscaping and drainage this specific plan also implements the citys general plan land use objectives development within the specific plan area will be subject to standards that are more specific than the requirements of the underlying e7 20000 zoning district the specific plan area will be rezoned specific plan  2 exh a 2011  the neighborhood a many neighborhoods in glendora were developed with large subdivision tracts that included complete road networks unified singlepurpose land uses and functional comprehensive infrastructure in contrast the specific plans foothill neighborhood evolved incrementally over several decades by means of an assortment of tracts and individual home building actions many homes have evolved over time per a series of modifications as a result the neighborhood exhibits vastly different looks across the landscape in some cases such as along baldy vista avenue the streetscape includes large homes with similar roof pitches and a limited range of exterior treatments all set back identically on the other hand homes elsewhere in the neighborhood are often oneofakind with varying setbacks styles sizes and details b the streetscapes are also markedly different for instance baldy vista avenue has a generous pavement width and concrete curbs on the other hand milton drive in the same neighborhood narrows to nearly a single curbless lane with the homes displaying a range of sizes styles and setbacks similarly the neighborhood along yucca ridge road has a rural character and shares nearly no characteristics with foxglove courts residences of uniform vintage and similar design c throughout all of this the neighborhood has remained incomplete always divided and interrupted by nearly 95 acres of nonresidential land use in the form of the monrovia nursery the specific plan now that the nursery has ceased operations on this acreage it is vacant and the neighborhood has an opportunity to be completed d in response to the eclectic character of the neighborhood this specific plan was tasked with providing standards and directives that assure compatibility within a diverse design setting while ensuring that city requirements for development and infrastructure are met the attraction of this neighborhood lies in the range and variety of homes that display individual expression and largely recede into generously shaded home sites this specific plan seeks to respect this character and fit within it the following factors drove this specific plan 1 infill in character the neighborhood is protective of the appeal of their community the infill that is to occur in the specific plan will not be a jarring departure from the general character 2 compatible design the city of glendora and the neighborhood wanted to see development in the specific plan that is compatible and performs a transition between the current neighborhood and new development 3 nonstandardized architecture the neighborhood does not have a single consistent identifiable architecture therefore stock design standards that rely on specific architecture eg mediterranean craftsman american farmhouse were not applicable  2 exh a 2011  traffic concerns the neighborhood has been active in framing this process and helping this specific plan address their concerns as in most public input undertakings this process sorted array of concerns ideas suggestions constraints and opportunities as the process advanced a balance was attained between individual desires broader public policy and community building approaches consequently though many ideas were incorporated several demands were not included for instance many in the neighborhood initially opposed extending streets linking the northern specific plan area with the southern specific plan area due to concerns about traffic for the most part concerns about traffic rested primarily on the possibility of passthrough traffic and in response to this previous concepts included no street connections between the north and south it is worthy to note that current city of glendora general plan policy no longer allows the extension of streets or completion of street links between the city of glendora and other jurisdictions therefore though previous concepts proposed a street link to citrus avenue within the city of azusa such a link is now prohibited as a result concerns about cutor nonneighborhood traffic are no longer valid instead the specific plan proposes the extension of baldy vista avenue thus providing a route neighborhood between sierra madre avenue and barranca avenue near the burlington northern santa fe railroad crossing an access point is proposed into the city of azusa for pedestrians bicycles and emergency vehicles but not public vehicular traffic  2 exh a 2011  the plan in brief a this specific plan proposes 124 detached singlefamily residential homes on lots of at least 20000 square feet although this specific plan contains its own development standards it closely follows the city of glendoras e7 20000 zoning district glendora municipal  this specific plan contains a set of grading drainage circulation and design guidelines created to result in new homes compatible with the existing neighborhood b this specific plan includes text and diagrams that specify the following in detail 1 the distribution location and extent of the land uses within the specific plan 2 the distribution location of public and private circulation sewage water drainage and other essential facilities proposed to be located within the specific plan needed to support the land uses 3 standards and criteria by which development will proceed 4 a program of implementation measures including regulations programs public works projects and financing measures necessary to carry out the provisions of subsections b1 2 and 3 of this section 5 a statement of the relationship of the specific plan to the general plan figure 1 regional location vision  planning approaches it is unusual for an established neighborhood to experience what has occurred in this community the departure of the monrovia nursery operations from the neighborhood has opened up nearly 95 acres the specific plan of vacant land to redevelopment presenting the opportunity to convert the property from nursery use to neighborhood homes a planning approach 1compatible design create design regulations that result in new homes that are compatible with but do not duplicate the late 20th century homes in the neighborhood b planning approach 2contemporary standards produce design regulations that meet todays planning energy sustainability engineering and communitybuilding standards  2 exh a 2011  goals the specific plan was charged with a set of goals that drove the plan and were the focus and purpose of the undertaking a goal 1exhibit respect for existing home market values the specific plan had to account for the property values and property rights of the existing adjacent neighborhood b goal 2create a unified community the specific plan had to result in new development that will be physically and functionally harmonious with the existing neighborhood c goal 3address neighborhood infrastructure the specific plan had to address shortcomings within the broader neighborhood infrastructure 1 the lack of full vehicular circulation which impacts emergency emt police fire response time and restricts emergency evacuation options 2 the existing poor drainage system that has resulted in problems during storm events 3 water pressure and water availability improvements 4 meeting fuel modification requirements to reduce fire hazards d goal 4serve as a basis for future city development entitlements the specific plan had to provide a development template for future developersubmitted entitlements including tentative maps grading plans infrastructure improvement plans and private lot development plans e goal 5create marketdriven new development the specific plan had to contain regulations that result in homes that meet the demands of the marketplace and that make economic sense for the developers of the specific plan property  2 exh a 2011  plan elements a plan element 1zoning although the actual zoning for the specific

specific plan will include development guidelines derived from an understanding of the existing neighborhood that address bulk mass setbacks height and number of floors it will complete a vehicle and pedestrian circulation system that unifies the neighborhood from north to south it will develop infrastructure systems that account for water sewer and drainage demands the plan will propose a new public linear park  2 exh a 2011  public benefits this specific plan provides the following public benefits a public benefit 1land use certainty the specific plan includes a final land use plan for the 95 acres that used to house a nursery operation it establishes that the specific plan will be developed as 124 detached singlefamily residences on lots of at least 20000 square feet putting to rest many concerns about the future use of the land b public benefit 2settles the issue of road extensions the specific plan proposes the extension of baldy vista avenue it also confirms that calera avenue will not be extended and that west danton drive and oakbank drive will only have emergency access beyond their current limits the specific plan proposes no roadway extension west to monrovia lanecitrus avenue in the city of azusa however it will provide a restricted link for emergency and pedestrian access only c public benefit 3no cutthrough street connections by not connecting the specific plan street system west into the city of azusa to monrovia lanecitrus avenue the specific plan will not result in a cutbetween citrus avenue in the city of azusa and barranca avenue in the city of glendora d public benefit 4minimize traffic the build out of 124 detached singlefamily residences on lots of a minimum 20000 square feet will generate less traffic than other types of land use options such as multiplefamily or certain nonresidential uses this minimizes the traffic impact of the development on the local neighborhood e public benefit 5safer sierra madre avenue sierra madre avenue will be widened with more defined shoulders and edges plus the introduction of a safe sidewalk and an improved intersection at barranca avenue f public benefit 6minimal new rightsofway the specific plan requires that new street sections meet current city of glendora engineering design standards but it does not require the widening of local streets outside of the specific plan with the exception of improvements to sierra madre avenue a portion of milton drive yucca ridge as well as small portions of barranca avenue at sierra madre avenue where proposed connections are to be made g public benefit 7drainage solutions the specific plan provides for a comprehensive approach to drainage problems onsite and offsite improvements new storm drains are planned at calera avenue donington street baldy vista avenue and leadora avenue to minimize storm flows within the local streets and in baldy vista creek h public benefit 8assured privacy where new homes are planned adjacent to existing residences lot orientation and pad heightseparation will help minimize concerns for privacy where necessary some lots in the specific plan area will be restricted to one story only i public benefit 9improved sewer connections underperforming sewer segments are located below foxglove court between danton and oakbank drive and most of the segment at newhillfoothill between oakbank & citrus the general function of the sewer network will be improved as part of the implementation of the specific plan j public benefit 10a new linear park a linear park containing many attributes similar to the existing linear park within the arboreta specific plan east of barranca avenue is proposed k public benefit 11dependable water supply and water pressure an adequate water infrastructure system will be provided a hydraulic study will be conducted as part of the implementation of this specific plan which will determine water line size figure 2 master plan  2 exh a 2011 master plan  land use

purpose of the signal is to allow a uturn movement at the intersection enabling residents to have access to the site from the southbound leg of barranca no left turn into the site is allowed from northbound barranca because the proximity of the railroad track to the project entry makes the left turn unsafe in the event of vehicle queuing to make the left but it also does provide the means of access to the linear park but this is a secondary purpose b emergency access points four emergency access points are located in figure 4 proposed circulation and detailed designs of each are shown in figures 10 c sierra madre avenue widening sierra madre avenue is an important and popular route that forms the northern edge of the specific plan it serves as a critical circulation element for automobiles and should serve as a safe and convenient pedestrian route as well however in its current state sierra madre avenue has effectively no pedestrian or bicycle facilities the rightofway consists of a narrow twolane road with nearly no shoulders and a severe dropoff without any sidewalks curbs barriers or landscaping the specific plan calls for retaining the northern edge of pavement but regrading and widening the roadbed adding an 8foot onstreet parking lane on the north and potentially curb and gutter further to the south is a 12foot westbound travel lane a 12foot center turn

subdivision or parcel map and applicable local grading regulations the monrovia nursery property has been used as a commercial nursery for several decades and has been graded for that purpose this specific plan transforms this land into two residential lot subdivisions with minimum 20000 squarefoot parcels  this will require new grading which will conform to this specific plan 1 the northern specific plan generally slopes to the south at an approximate grade of 10% with an approximate 65foot elevation change across the site which is only 600 feet wide the site is bound to the north by sierra madre avenue barranca avenue to the east and existing residential lots to the south and west to accommodate this grade difference within the project site the grading plan has been sensitive to grade transitions to avoid the feel of new structures towering over the existing residences the site is kept at an elevation below sierra madre to help diminish the vertical difference across the site and will also allow the residences on the north side of sierra madre to continue to enjoy their views to the south the slopes in this area are kept at an approximate maximum height of 25 feet to help reduce the vertical difference to the existing residences to the south and between proposed residences in this new subdivision figure 17 grading plan 2 the southern specific plan slopes generally to the southwest the low point of the site is at the corner of citrus avenue and the existing burlington northern santa fe railroad the southwest corner of the specific plan as such the projects detention basin is located here the grading of this southern site is dominated by the existing edge conditions as the site is adjacent to existing residences to the north east and west and the existing bnsf railroad to the south the proposed grading of this area reduces the size of the slopes between the new and existing residences to better blend the site into the neighborhood while also balancing the site 3 the fairmount cemetery is surrounded by the specific plan in response the plan maintains access to and includes a landscape buffer around the historic cemetery 4 a private street is included to the highest point of the southern project site north of the fairmount cemetery to access five minimum 20000 square foot lots and to provide access to the existing residence on top of the hill at 1326 sierra madre avenue this private street will not exceed a maximum grade of 15% 5 to insure that all existing facilities utilities and easements are taken into account and that the grading is within appropriate guidelines for all agencies affected by the project the developers engineer shall submit the grading plans to all affected agencies for review and approval prior to the

exh a 2011  drainage and flood control the specific plan has addressed several key issues related to drainage and water quality design requirements the proposed drainage plan will help alleviate existing flooding concerns adequately convey proposed stormwater runoff within proposed storm drain systems and will include the use of existing and proposed detention facilities onsite and offsite to reduce peak runoff rates to levels equal to or less than preproject levels and below the design capacity of the downstream storm drain system the proposed water quality plan for stormwater runoff will help reduce the transport of urban pollutants that may occur onsite towards downstream receiving waters following are descriptions of the project area hydrology detention hydraulics and water quality a hydrology a preliminary drain detention and susmp analysis for monrovia nursery project  glendora portion  preliminary drainage report for the specific plan has been prepared to analyze the hydrologic impacts of development for the north and south portions of the city of glendora monrovia nursery project area the monrovia nursery property was previously comprised of nearly 600 acres that extended across the city of azusa and city of glendora a portion of the property was sold in recent years for the development of the city of azusa portion leaving the city of glendora portion as a separate development project this is an important consideration as both portions share the same overall watershed that is tributary project area and share an outfall location at the southwest corner of the specific plan referred to as the 1264 drain located at the intersection of the existing railroad and citrus avenue which is maintained by los angeles county the preliminary hydrology for the specific plan includes a comprehensive analysis of the overall watershed including both the city of azusa and city of glendora project areas that are tributary to the 1264 drain for the specific plan the existing condition is considered the proposed condition from the city of azusa project with the north and south portions of the glendora project undeveloped the proposed condition for the glendora project models the north and south portions as developed and uses a proposed storm drain alignment that conveys flows from the north to the south within baldy vista avenue to the southwest corner of the project into a proposed detention facility referred to as facility g1 b detentiondetention basins the following list identifies the names and locations of existing and proposed detention basins that are relevant to the specific plan see figure 20 stormwater plan for locations figure 20 stormwater plan 1 facility 2b existing located just west of west leadora avenue on the city of azusa side of the city boundary line it was constructed as part of the azusa project and was designed to discharge less than 40 cubic feet per second cfs there are no physical modifications proposed for detention basin 2b the northwest portion of the project will continue to drain basin 2b due to the development the amount of runoff entering and exiting the basin will increase compared to existing conditions however the design for 2b accounted for the future developed condition of this area therefore the maximum water surface elevation wsel will remain within the basin and the maximum outflow will remain within the 40 cfs design criteria originally intended for the facility as a part of the adjacent city of azusa 2 facility 4d existing located further south along the city boundary line and southwest of fairmount cemetery this detention basin straddles the municipal boundary existing within both the city of azusa and the city of glendora figure 21 watershed the specific plan proposes that the glendora portion of detention facility 4d be filled fulfilling an agreement between the city of azusa and the city of glendora then glendora runoff is to be redirected to proposed detention facility g1 detention basin 4d would therefore experience a significant decrease in tributary area a slight increase in the maximum wsel for a 50year design storm and a significant decrease in maximum outflow into the existing storm drain system in citrus avenue the increase in the maximum wsel is acceptable since the maximum wsel remains well below the top of basin elevation 3 facility g1 proposed proposed to be located at the southwest corner of the specific plan and intended to replace the glendora portion of facility 4d it would be installed near the northeast corner of the citrus avenue and existing burlington northern santa fe railroad intersection detention basin g1 will be constructed as part of the specific plan and would receive runoff from a majority of the north and south portions of the specific plan the tributary watershed north of sierra madre avenue that will be conveyed specific plan and from the existing neighborhood located between the north and south specific plan the resulting discharge rate at outfall 2c approximately 620 cfs into los angeles county department of public works 1264 drain 78inch reinforced concrete pipe will be less than the approved postproject flow rates in the approved august 2005 report prepared for the adjacent city of azusa project and significantly less than the approved design discharge flow rate of 920 cfs for the 1264 drain also identified in the august 2005 report figure 22 facility g1 c hydraulicsstorm drain there are existing drainage problems as addressed in the preliminary drainage report dated  ie flooding concerns identified within the specific plan proposed drainage improvements should help alleviate these issues and adequately convey runoff specific plan to the downstream storm drain facility at the southwest corner of the project site the proposed improvements will be sized to convey offsite flows received from the north entering the site from sierra madre avenue at two separate locations from the west entering the site from one existing detention basin while the other existing detention basin is routed down citrus avenue within the city of azusa project limits and onsite flows from throughout the specific plan and surrounding neighborhood both existing and proposed residential streets and lots the exact alignment of the main storm drain segments is subject to minor adjustment in final engineering  however the storm drain systems will run towards the southwest corner and ultimately discharge to the los angeles county department of public works facility 1264 drain  78inch reinforced concrete pipe a preliminary layout for the proposed storm drain system and existing storm drain systems to remain in place are shown in figure 20 stormwater plan d water qualitypermanent stormwater bmps 1 in the city of glendora water quality treatment solutions are to use infiltration extended detention or retention based solutions for large singlefamily lots requirements include installing an infiltration trench or bioretention area on each singlefamily lot sized to infiltrate 075 inches from the lot each lot will utilize one of these methods or combination thereof to satisfy the water quality treatment requirements  however the newly created streets also require treatment among the solutions for stormwater will include one of the following or an approved equivalent a vegetated swales with infiltration where feasible  b bioretention areas adjacent to inlet locations  c proprietary systems such as filterra or modular wetland at each inlet location the bottom portion of detention basin g1 will be used for infiltration or extended detention water quality benefits limited to streets in close proximity to the basin 2 pursuant to low impact development lid requirements each lot in the specific plan will be required to utilize site design best management practices bmp directing impervious areas to pervious areas ie roof drains to landscaping and street runoff will be directed to vegetated areas as well where feasible therefore water quality treatment lid and epi requirements will be met with a variety of permanent stormwater bmp solutions for portions of the streets where it is not feasible to direct runoff to natural vegetated areas then proprietary bioretention systems may be utilized that will provide contact time with soil and vegetation for water quality storm events 3 the following summarizes the preliminary solutions proposed for water quality and lidepi requirements a trench andor bioretention raingarden b streets i vegetated swales with bioretention or infiltration trench  ii bioretention systems at curb inlet locations  iii soft bottom detention basin with bioretentioninfiltration 4 each of the above systems will be numerically sized to detain retain or infiltrate the first 075 inches of stormwater runoff where feasible with remaining areas numerically sized to treat 075 inches or a comparable treatment flow rate cfs such as bioretention systems at inlet locations preliminary locations of these facilities are shown in figure 23 water quality plan figure 23 water quality plan 5 these permanent stormwater bmps located on lots will be maintained by the private landowner or an established homeowners association  the permanent bmps installed for treatment of public street runoff will be maintained by the city of glendora in the case of the soft bottom detention basin the los angeles county department of public workslos angeles county flood control district will assume operation and maintenance responsibilities upon

affording every homeowner with a significant private open space within their own lot therefore public open space was not a driving emphasis of the plan however open space is still important to engender a sense of shared experience and community especially open space that contains amenities to encourage pedestrian and bicycle circulation this specific plan proposes several open space facilities that demonstrate an appreciation for the history of the area and foster neighborhood interaction a linear park the specific plan includes a linear park adjacent to the burlington northern santa fe railroad that include facilities similar to those already in place in the linear park east of barranca avenue including a trailsidewalk a noise attenuation wall stormwater facilities and

into residential areas northeast of the fairmount cemetery overhead lines are also located throughout much of the northern perimeter of the specific plan  south between the property and existing residences in general overhead service is provided to the rear of the adjacent residential properties it is anticipated that implementation of the specific plan will require coordination with southern california edison to extend electrical service into the proposed specific plan all new electrical service within the specific plan must be underground the developer will need to coordinate with the city and southern california edison to identify existing poles and wires that may need to be relocated to implement the specific plan c natural gas the existing locations of the natural gas facilities

increase property taxes based on a propertys assessed value since that time assessment districts which have been in existence since the early 1900s have been used on a widespread basis as an alternative method for financing public improvements currently about one in three properties in california is part of an assessment district 2 authorizing legislation for assessment districts there are two primary acts which authorize the establishment of assessment districts a the improvement act of 1911 streets & highways et seq which can be used by cities counties and other municipal governments to fund a wide range of public infrastructure projects the 1911 act can also fund maintenance of improvements b the municipal improvement act of 1913 streets & highways et seq which can be used by cities counties joint powers authorities and other special districts to fund water electrical gas and lighting infrastructure public transit facilities as well as other basic infrastructure needs c the improvement bond act of 1915 streets & highways et seq is normally used in combination with one of these acts to issue bonds to finance the improvements the vast majority of assessment district projects are paid for with 1915 act improvement bonds 3 assessment district purpose an assessment district is created to finance improvements when no other source of money is available assessment districts are often formed in undeveloped areas and are used to build roads and install water and sewer systems so that new homes or commercial space can be built assessment districts may also be used in older areas to finance new public improvements or other additions to the community 4 assessment district formation an assessment district is created by a sponsoring local government agency such as a city or county the procedure for forming a district begins with a petition signed by owners of the property who want the public improvement the proposed district will include all properties that will directly benefit from the improvements to be constructed a public hearing is held at which time property owners have the opportunity to protest the assessment district 5 once approved property owners have the opportunity to prepay the assessment prior to bond issuance after this cash payment period is over a special assessment lien is recorded against each property with an unpaid assessment then these parcels will pay their total assessment installments on the county property tax bill the property owners will have the right to prepay the remaining balance of the assessment at any time including applicable prepayment fees b melloroos 1 melloroos bonds the melloroos named for its legislative sponsors community facilities district act of 1982 established another method whereby almost every municipal subdivision of the state may form a special separate district to finance a long list of public facilities by the sale of bonds and finance certain public services on a payasyougo basis these community facilities districts are formed and bond issues authorized by a twothirds vote of the property owners in the district typically the only voters in a district are one or more real estate developers who own or have an option on all of the land in the district these landbased financings were nicknamed dirt bonds by the bond advisor years ago bonds are sold to finance facilities that can include schools parks libraries public utilities and other forms of infrastructure the districts may provide public services that include police and fire protection recreation programs area maintenance library services and flood and storm drainage bonded debt service andor the public services are paid for by special taxes levied on the real property within the district as the developer subdivides and sells off the land the new property owner assumes the tax burden tax delinquencies can lead to fines and penalties and ultimately foreclosure and sale the ultimate security for melloroos bonds is the value of the real property being taxed consequently a provision in the law requires the appraised value of the land be three times the bonded debt recent foreclosure sales have cast doubts on the skills of the appraisers and underscore the risk of some of this debt when a severe real estate slump hits developers 2 background in 1978 californians enacted proposition 13 which limited the ability of local public agencies to increase property taxes based on a propertys assessed value in 198 the melloroos community facilities act of 1982 government 3 was created to provide an alternate method of financing needed improvements and services 3 the melloroos community facilities act of 1982 the act allows any county city special district school district or joint powers authority to establish a melloroos community facilities district a cfd which allows for financing of public improvements and services the services and improvements that melloroos cfds can finance include streets sewer systems and other basic infrastructure police protection fire protection ambulance services schools parks libraries museums and other cultural facilities by law the cfd is also entitled to recover expenses needed to form the cfd and administer the annual special taxes and bonded debt 4 melloroos cfd purpose a cfd is created to finance public improvements and services when no other source of money is available cfds are normally formed in undeveloped areas and are used to build roads and install water and sewer systems so that new homes or commercial space can be built cfds are also used in older areas to finance new schools or other additions to the community 5 melloroos cfd formation a cfd is created by a sponsoring local government agency the proposed district will include all properties that will benefit from the improvements to be constructed or the services to be provided a cfd cannot be formed without a twothirds majority vote of residents living within the proposed boundaries or if there are fewer than 12 residents the vote is instead conducted of current landowners in many cases that may be a single owner or developer once approved a special tax lien is placed against each property in the cfd property owners then pay a special tax each year if the project cost is high municipal bonds will be sold by the cfd to provide the large amount of money initially needed to build the improvements or fund the services c landscaping and lighting act district 1 background a 1972 landscaping and lighting act allows for the creation of a district used by local government agencies to pay for landscaping lighting and other improvements and services in public areas as a form of benefit assessment it is based on the concept of assessing only those properties that benefit from improvements financed either directly or indirectly property values because it is considered a benefit assessment a 1972 act assessment is not subject to proposition 13 limitations 2 the landscaping and lighting act of 1972 this legislation streets & highways  22500 allows local governmental agencies to form landscape & lighting maintenance districts for the purpose of financing the costs and expenses of landscaping and lighting public areas this act can be used by any local agency including cities counties and special districts such as school districts or water districts the many approved uses include installation and maintenance of landscaping statues fountains general lighting traffic lights recreational and playground courts and equipment and public restrooms additionally the act allows acquisition of land for parks and open spaces plus the construction of community centers municipal auditoriums or halls to be financed notes or bonds can be issued to finance larger improvements under the act 3 landscape lighting district formation the sponsoring agency conducts a specific plan prepares an engineers report and proposes the formation of a district and the levy of assessments affected property owners are then notified and a public hearing is held in order to approve the district a majority vote of affected property owners assessment balloting procedure is required once approved assessments will be placed on property tax bills each year to pay for the improvements and services 4 annual charge by law prop 13 benefit assessments cannot be based on the value of property instead each district establishes a benefit formula and each parcel in the service area is assessed according to the benefit it receives from the services and improvements  2 exh a 2011  exactions and fees government a requires an analysis of potential and actual governmental constraints upon the maintenance improvement or development of housing for all income levelsincludingfees and other exactions required of developers and local processing and permit procedures a types of fees and exactions 1 housing development is typically subject to two types of fees or exactions permit processing fees for planning and zoning  and impact fees or exactions imposed to defray all or a portion of the public costs related to the development project 2 these fees and exactions can impact the cost and feasibility of housing development and its affordability and involve issues of private property rights high planning and site development fees can impact property owners ability to make improvements or repairs especially for lowerincome households development projects are subject to fees and exactions from a growing number of public entities ranging from special districts to regional agencies it is important to estimate the cumulative amount of fees housing development will be subject to for development of viable proposals  information about the city or countys fees and exactions is among the most critical for both processing fees and impact fees state law specifies procedural and nexus requirements a government requires that planning and permit processing fees do not exceed the reasonable cost of providing the service unless approved by the voters  agencies collecting fees must provide project applicants with a statement of amounts and purposes of all fees at the time of fee imposition or project approval b government et seq mitigation fee act sets forth procedural requirements for adopting and collecting capital facilities fees and exactions and requires they be supported by a report establishing the relationship between the amount of any capital facilities fee and the use for which it is collected b requisite analysis 1 identify and analyze permit processing and planning fees and development and impact fees and exactions and how they have been established relative to the above statutory requirements including any inlieu fees 2 identify exactions such as land dedication requirements eg streets public utility and other rightofways easements parks open space etc and other exactions imposed on development 3 include information on how fees are collected ie at the beginning of the approval process at the time of building permit issuance or deferred until the project receives certificate of occupancy 4 identify any policies or efforts to moderate high fee impacts for housing for lowerincome households such as fee waivers fee deferrals streamlined fee processing and consolidated fee schedules c nexus requirements 1 state law requires establishment of a nexus between the projected development impacts and the public facilities for which impact fees are imposed government a of the mitigation fee act  requires that any city or county which establishes imposes or increases a fee as a condition of development approval do all of the following a identify the purpose of the fee  b identify the use to which the fee is to be put  c determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the fees use and the type of development project on which the fee is imposed  and d determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the public facility and the type of development project upon which the fee is imposed 2 government b further requires the locality to determine whether there is a reasonable relationship between the specific amount the fee imposed and the costs of building expanding or upgrading public facilities such determinations also known as nexus studies are made in written form and must be updated whenever new fees are imposed or existing fees are increased 3 the act also requires jurisdictions to segregate fee revenues from other municipal funds and to refund them if they are not spent within 5 years any person may request an audit to determine whether any fee or charge levied by the city or county exceeds the amount reasonably necessary to cover the cost of the service provided government d under government fees charged for zoning changes use permits building permits and similar processing fees are subject to the same nexus requirements as development fees lastly under government agencies collecting fees must provide project applicants with a statement of the amounts and purposes of all fees at the time of fee imposition or project approval  2 exh a 2011  borrowing a general obligation bonds 1 definition general obligation bonds are a form of longterm borrowing in which the state issues municipal securities and pledges its full faith and credit to their repayment bonds are repaid over many years debt service payments the california constitution requires that go bonds be approved by a majority vote of the public and sets repayment of go debt before all other obligations of the state except those for k14 education 2 key statutory authorities a of the california constitution prohibits the legislature from creating debt or liability which exceeds $300000 without a majority vote by the people except in case of war b government title 2 division 4 et seq sets out the statutory framework for go bonds statutory authorization for individual go bond measures is placed programmatically in the codes eg prison authorizations are located in the penal  b certificates of participation cops a form of lease revenue bond that permits the investor to participate in a stream of lease payments installment payments or loan payments relating to the acquisition or construction of specific equipment land or facilities in theory the certificate holder could foreclose on the equipment or facility financed in the event of default but so far no investor has ended up owning a piece of a school house or a storm drainage system a very popular financing device in california since proposition 13 because cop issuance does not require voter approval cops are not viewed legally as debt because payment is tied to an annual appropriation by the government body as a result cops are seen by investors as providing weaker security and often carry ratings that are a notch or two below an agencys general obligation rating  2 exh a 2011 development standards  permitted uses detached singlefamily residences accessory dwelling units accessory buildings appropriate home occupation

opportunities are available and solar energy systems can be installed 2 solar access guidelines a allow solar access for neighbors wherever possible orient building volumes and second stories to allow solar access to neighboring properties limit the height of structures near northerly property lines such that the structure does not unduly encroach into a neighbors solar access plane b design for solar installation i exposures design for southern roof exposure shade the west side create a wind break on the north side place and orient homes to take advantage of natural heating and cooling sun and wind exposure and solar energy opportunities panels should ideally face south with southeast and southwest as secondary options if the placement cant face south west is better than east to capture late afternoon sun ii tilt angle the ideal tilt angle for southern california is approximately 17 degrees roughly a  pitch iii roof space for solar collectors technologies as of spring 2010 require between 300 and 600 square feet of southfacing shadefree roof space for most solar collection installations for average homes 25003000 square feet this is only a guideline as it is likely that with the advance in technology the efficiency will improve and less space will likely be required iv building integrated photovoltaics bipv as much as possible solar collectors placed on frontfacing roofs and visible from the street should be unobtrusive matching within reason the color and texture of the roof technology is emerging that will likely make this more possible figure 36 solar access design  2 exh a 2011  building envelope building envelope refers to the planes and surfaces of a home building setback and height limitations in the specific plan place some scale restraints on new construction however a house built to maximum height and within setbacks may still result in a dwelling that is not compatible with the neighborhood a dwelling may appear massive or bulky if the shape andor faade is too simple and lacking in articulation and detail dwellings of different size can be in scale with one another if they share architectural characteristics including building shape complexity of form or style and detail a overall building envelope guidelines 1 use offsets if appropriate for the architectural style use offsets extending to grade on the long dimension of the dwelling articulate all sides of the dwelling facing a public right of way consistently as well as on any attached accessory structure 2 use decks balconies recesses use projecting or recessing architectural details such as decks bay windows or balconies and appropriate complementary changes in building materials or colors to visually break up long unarticulated walls 3 design to mitigate bulk and mass minimize size bulk and scale use of appropriate roof style and shallow pitch form and materials varied setbacks asymmetric design window treatment and location and door size and type break up mass to create interplay between various building elements 4 account for the size of neighboring homes structures that are significantly larger in size bulk scale height or architectural style from adjacent dwellings may be allowed if the new dwelling is consistent with the design guidelines regarding placement privacy shade and overall neighborhood character figure 37 offset examples

tiles and others approved by the city of glendora 3 roof elements flashing sheet metal vent stacks and pipes should be painted to match adjacent building surfaces or the roof or otherwise treated to recede into the background 4 skylights skylights should be designed as an integral part of the roof and exhibit quality in materials and design for instance they should be flat bronzecolored glass in bronzeanodized frames bubble and white plastic skylights are not allowed 5 exposed rafter tails exposed heavy timber rafter tails may be used where appropriate 6 gutters and eaves if used exposed gutters should be nonextruded halfround gutters with round downspouts unless otherwise approved by the city of glendora gutters and downspouts should be designed as a continuous architectural feature gutters and downspouts may be made of copper or shall be painted dark to imitate aged metal or painted to match the roof the trim or the wall downspouts and rain leaders should be placed in building corners and at inconspicuous locations decorative gutter boxes may be used sparingly where required roof eaves should be boxed in with fire resistant materials to protect the underside of eaves and soffits 7 dormers dormers should be robust and significant and provide relief from the mass of the roof figure 43 dormer examples 8 privacy windows should be placed mindful of potential intrusions in privacy for adjacent residents 9 overhangs in some styles of architecture generous overhangs are typical and expected and in such instances a minimum overhang of 12 inches is desirable some styles do not have generous overhangs some overhangs are extended to create trellises and porches if that is consistent with the architectural style 10 overall integration of elements integrate solar energy collector panels tiles or shingles skylights and other roofmounted equipment into the roof forms minimize their visual prominence when viewed from the street and nearby dwellings rooftop heating and

avoid placing accessory structures where they are a dominant component of the view from the street frontage or other public viewpoints or an adjoining residence  2017   2 exh a 2011  building details a windows and doors doors and windows are visually distinctive and prominent features on a dwelling they are a link between private and public space and can provide a sense of security for both they also establish an architectural rhythm and affect the apparent mass of the dwelling 1 window guidelines a space between openings windows and doors should have ample dimension between all openings and building corners to reflect the opening to mass ratios of each style b surrounds and sills with the exception of accent windows and doors window and door trim and surrounds should have a consistent treatment on all major building elevations window surrounds shall be deeply recessed stucco or rustic stone window sills should be relatively flat with a slight incline c lites and divides windows should have true nonremovable divided lites individual window panes should be relatively small rectangular and vertically proportioned ranch homes are allowed more horizontally proportioned windows because that is the traditional approach d recessed windows recess windows into the wall plane enough to add shadow effects and provide visual relief the exterior plaster return should be perpendicular and tight to the window frame figure 51 recessed windows with awnings e construction wood clad wood or steel hinged casement or fixed casement windows are preferred second floor windows should be vertically proportioned casements or french doors with decorative iron or wooden railings f frame color window frames are encouraged to be a color other than white g awnings fabric and metal

details h picture windows a picture window or bay window is often located on the primary faade additional picture windows are typically located to frame notable views 2 door guidelines a entry doors the primary entry portal or entry door should receive special delineation and greater differentiation from all other exterior doors designs should emphasize the main entrance with porches archways alcoves and a prominent location on the front faade design the entry in proportion to the scale of the dwelling avoid the use of columns towers and other entry features that are out of scale or style with the dwelling andor neighborhood figure 53 window shutters figure 54 metal awnings b door construction door may be single or paired doors should typically be wood either paneled or plain main entry doors should be but are not required to be ceremonial substantial and robust with real wood glass windows glass side lites luxury hardware and above average height c upper story recessed exterior doors performing a deep recess and adding railings awnings doors and decorative accents to the typical programmed window opening can result in an upper story recessed exterior door which results in shadow effects and interest figure 55 entry door details figure 56 front entry treatment b exterior wall treatment guidelines 1 number of materials use a limited number of exterior materials to minimize conflicting design features 2 color use warm earthtoned materials and colors to integrate with the surrounding terrain and reduce glare and the apparent mass of the dwelling exterior materials and colors should complement the style of the dwelling and neighborhood and permit it to blend with surrounding natural features when viewed from a distance wall cladding should vary in tone color material and arrangement to diminish the bulk and to fit in the neighborhood vernacular a structure should not be overwhelmed with exterior finishes to the degree that it adds to the appearance of bulk and mass to the structure figure 57 balanced mix of exterior wall treatments figure 58 exterior wall treatment 3 application of materials wrap accent materials stone wood cladding etc needed to maintain the integrity of the architectural style on all elevations stone for instance should be carried around the corner to a logical terminus wall projection chimney etc the expectation is that faades with more exposure to public views will have more detailing 4 stucco finishes for the most part stucco finish should be a quality finish not heavy mottled burned and faux finishes which reflect an authentic aged plaster are acceptable use fire resistant materials such as stucco masonry or other firerated materials on exterior walls and throughout the structure use of durable and recycled construction materials such as cement fiber siding and tile roofing is encouraged 5 use of stone stone should be an accent such as the cladding of one bay not the dominant material of the entire home and it should exhibit a range of earth tone colors common to the area stone and soils formal rectangular equalsized dressed stone quoins used to reinforce an exterior corner of a building and laid on squared beds are allowed use of real stone and high grade quality synthetic stone faux stone andor stucco stone is allowed 6 wood when wood is used it should be

ones place plants with adequate spacing and use permeable hardscape features to break up continuous dense cover of shrubs and trees d architectural enhancement landscaping such as vines espeliers shrubs trees or trellises should be used to enhance the architecture creating attractive public and private open spaces e front yards front yards should be designed using plant material and other landscape elements that compliment the building form horizontal and vertical lines hardscape and softscapes that display texture and color compatible with the colors and building materials of the building f shadows and shade landscape plans should locate trees shrubs and new structures to avoid casting shade onto a neighbors solar energy system after that system is installed g root structures

anticipate and maintain natural form with the exception of turf areas all plants should be chosen and located so that they may be allowed to grow and mature in a natural form plants within public view should not be pruned into artificial shapes such as boxes balls triangles or topiary hedges should be planted in anticipation of full mature size to reduce the need for pruning to resolve conflicts with sidewalks and trails i chemical avoidance or elimination plant material should be chosen that is naturally compatible to the soils climate insect colonies and blight conditions of the specific plan setting so as to avoid or eliminate the need for the use of herbicides insecticides or other poisons and chemicals within both private and public property within the specific plan area figure 61

project infrastructuredevelopment phasing a the phasing of improvements in the specific plan area has been determined by the need to protect the health safety and welfare of future residents of the project as well as the people and property surrounding the project site the lack of storm drain and flood control protection in the area subjects the specific plan area and surrounding properties to a potentially hazardous condition due to the substantial amounts of stormwater runoff which can be generated in the watershed above the project the condition could be severely exacerbated if the foothills above the watershed experience a heavy rain event after a wildfire heavy flooding after a wildfire in unprotected watersheds is a welldocumented occurrence and was most recently exhibited in the la canada flintridge area in the aftermath of the 2009 station fire b while the project is not responsible for protecting existing homes exposed to the flooding hazard in the watershed new homes must be protected from the existing hazard the project must also address any increases in runoff resulting from new development or alterations to drainage patterns caused as a result of the project c given the size of the project and the potential for areas of the site to be developed independently or by different developers although developing the entire specific plan as one phase remains as a viable option the phasing plan described below ensures that certain infrastructure needs of the site are not accomplished in a piecemeal fashion but in a manner suitable to ensure the welfare of new

emissions safety and noise elements city of glendora safety and noise element goals planning consideration the most significant contributors to noise impacts are generated from transportation sources the city of glendora seeks to minimize the noise impacts associated with transportation to the greatest extent feasible minimizing these impacts requires the evaluation of existing noise sources and coordination of appropriate mitigation policy considerations goal 1 reduced noise impacts from transportation sources  n11 ensure traffic noise mitigation measures are included and implemented in the design of new development  n12 encourage the state department of transportation caltrans to continue programs that lead to the reduction of the noise levels on i210  n13 limit construction delivery and traffic to designated routes  n14 mitigate transportation equipment impacts at construction sites nontransportation noise impacts planning consideration nontransportation noise sources including those generated from commercialindustrial activities construction equipment and various community activities have the potential of introducing undesirable impacts within the city development policy and regulatory standards should consider the reduction of these nontransportation noise impacts and mitigate them to a less than significant level goal 2 reduced noise impacts from nontransportation sources  n21 review and update the noise on a regular basis to ensure noisegenerating uses are adequately addressed  n22 strive to resolve existing and potential conflicts between noise generating uses and human activities  n23 prohibit significant noise generating activities from locating adjacent to residential neighborhoods and near schools  n24 ensure that construction noise does not cause an adverse impact to the residents of the city by requiring that noise mitigation techniques be incorporated into all constructionrelated activities  n25 consider developing maximum noise standards for ventilation systems ie air conditioning units in residential areas coordination with land use planning planning consideration land use planning has a direct relationship with objectionable noise the location and type of land uses should consider the potential noise impacts generated therefore the evaluation of potential noise generation should be a consideration in all land use decisions goal 3 coordinated land use planning and noise mitigation  n31 ensure community noise equivalent levels cnel levels for noise sensitive land uses meet or exceed normally acceptable levels as defined by state of california standards  n32 enforce all noise standards as outlined in the citys noise n33 enforce limits set by the state of california to control noise levels particularly those governing motor vehicles  n34 ensure that all new development is consistent with exterior and interior noise standards  n35 incorporate noise reduction measures into all development proposals as necessary  n36 consider noise impacts associated with the development of nonresidential uses in the vicinity of residential uses  n37 require acoustical materials in all new residential and commercial developments where noise levels exceed the compatibility standards outlined in the noise element  n38 encourage the use of doublepaned windows for residential uses adjacent to the freeways and along major arterials  n39 encourage programs to retrofit existing homes to reduce noise impacts in the homes specific plan consistency with the safety and noise elements 1 the specific plan environmental review

articulated with a regular pattern of bays the buildings are capped with a continuous cornice and parapet and grounded by a continuous base smaller building massing may also include gable forms and roof monitors elements such as metal awnings signage and ornamental parapets provide a secondary rhythm on the faade round arches over windows and doorways may be seen this style is well suited for commercial institutional and mixed residential uses 2 romanesque revival style typical characteristics massing simple rectilinear forms emphasizing the appearance of heavy masonry buildings faade composition simple and regular rhythm of bays  can be wide with vertical openings or narrow with vertical openings larger building massing is capped with a continuous cornice and parapet and grounded with a continuous base  brick or brick veneer walls with stone cast stone or cast concrete details round arches over doors and windows may be seen roof form flat or lowpitched with parapet wall smaller building massing may have parapet or pediment gable ends gables with lowpitched shingle or metal roofs and roof monitors small gable roof elements on top of the main roof that provide additional light into the interior of the building windows vertically proportioned double hung casement fixed or awning windows may be grouped with mullions storefronts onebay multiplebay or fullbuilding wide may have awnings or upper casement windows that form a continuous band across the front elements balconies and galleries consistent with the faade ornamental brickwork and ornamental parapets 3 romanesque revival faade composition b victorianqueen anne 1 introduction victorian queen anne architecture is represented by a broad mix of styles that tend to focus on either distinctive gable roof design andor distinctive faade detailing often with bay front window treatment steep pitched irregular roof shapes dominant frontfacing gable patterned shingles bay windows and picturesque massing are strongly represented in this general architectural style decorative ornamentation partial or fullwidth porches of one story multiple gables and dormers occasional towers and turrets are also important features of victorian queen anne style differing wall treatments are a hallmark of the style this style is well suited for single family and apartment and condominium town home uses 2

decorative round lights or fan lights are also common ground floor full or partial width porches elevated above the street and approached by a stairway classic columns or spindle work are common elements 3 victorian commercialmixed use faade composition c neoclassical revival 1 introduction the neoclassical architectural style was directly inspired by the beauxarts style and the columbian exposition chicago worlds fair of 1893 basically the style reflects elements of greek architecture popular in the 19th century the style tends to include the features of classical symmetry fullheight porches with columns and temple fronts with various classical ornamentation such as dentil cornices this style is well suited for commercial and office uses 2 neoclassical revival typical characteristics massing symmetrical balanced proportions with temple front gable and full height column porches faade composition neoclassical faades are primarily represented by full classic column porches or entries and temple front gable with ornamentation  of critical importance is scale columns roof and cornice treatment should be in scale with the building materials can range from stone and brick to plain stucco finishes roof form the neoclassical roof is distinctive often a symmetrical temple front gable but flat roof forms are also included all roof forms usually have some form of dentil decorative blocking and cornice ornamentation there is usually a circular window or other ornamental feature centrally located under the gable windows windows tend to accent the symmetry of the faade they may have arch elements or plain single pane or double hung styles storefronts ground floor storefronts should follow the symmetry of the faade awnings should reflect a compatible symmetry and enhance the overall design elements other elements can include more intricate roof line balustrades arched bay elements rather than columns and decorative insets for classical sculpture and other medallions and frieze elements are also common 3 neoclassical revival faade composition d main street 1 introduction the main street architectural style is a general class of architecture that emerged in the 19th century as western cities and towns were settled they reflected simple patterns of clean lines from earlier eras without the elaborate detailing found in some of the revival architecture the style is characterized by symmetrical masonry buildings usually capped with a cornice and parapet and grounded with a continuous base windows provide symmetrical balance and rhythm to the faade elements such as galleries and awnings provide a secondary rhythm for the faade and allow the buildings to engage the public realm the style is well suited for commercial and office uses as well as second and thirdstory mixed use buildings 2 main street typical characteristics massing simple rectilinear forms faade composition simple and regular rhythm of bays repetitive vertical spaces created by deep vertically proportioned door and window openings buildings are grounded with a continuous base and capped with a continuous cornice and parapet  brick and veneer walls roof form flat or

composed of picturesque combinations of simple rectilinear forms of varying heights the buildings are capped with gabled or hipped roofs of red clay barrel tiles with little or no eave overhang courtyards and welldetailed structural elements such as pergolas trellises or loggias and arcades often provide another layer to the massing elements such as wood or metal balconies towers chimneys and other tile or wrought iron details add accents asymmetrical faades are common with arches over windows and doorways 2 spanish revival typical characteristics massing picturesque compositions of simple rectilinear forms of varying heights with lowpitched roof forms larger buildings often use these forms to create enclosed or semienclosed courtyards faade composition often asymmetrical faade

first style to diffuse eastward from the west the style was considered the california counterpart to the georgianinspired colonial revival style popular in the northeast most famously the style was adopted by both the southern pacific and santa fe railways for train stations resort hotels and other rail corridor buildings essentially as an effort to theme the southwest for eastern travelers the style includes missionshaped dormers andor roof parapet  wide overhanging eaves  exposed rafters  redtiled roofs  stucco walls  and arched windowsdoors on ground level 2 mission revival typical characteristics massing large regular or irregular forms enclosing interior courtyards  often elaborate towers and bellshaped parapets faade composition heavy stucco walls with regular archways and arcades exterior windows are minimal to control summer heat parapets and gables often have elaborate baroque styling roof form low pitched form with clay red tile  exposed rafters windows and doors exterior windows are minimal interior windows facing courtyards provide regular rhythm arched or simple rectilinear frames doorways and entries are arched storefronts arcades and galleries are typical with arched entries elements elaborate parapets  arcades with regular arched openings  windows balconies and door openings  heavy timber ceiling beams  heavy stucco walls  interior courtyards  accent towers 3 mission revival faade composition g craftsman bungalow 1 introduction the terms craftsman and bungalow are often interchangeable however craftsman refers to the arts and crafts movement and more particularly to the famous greene and greene brothers architecture style of southern california the bungalow form is inclusive of the craftsman style but also includes other building styles with porches and galleries craftsman architectural style is identified by lowpitched gabled roofs  wide overhanging eaves  exposed rafter tails  decorative brackets and corbels  front porches  and round tapered or square porch columns sash windows and wood detailing of all kinds are important features 2 craftsman bungalow typical characteristics massing picturesque one to threestory forms with combinations of rectilinear projections low pitched gabled roof lines with wide eaves give the structure an important horizontal relationship to the ground faade composition wide front porches with gabled roofs and decorative pillars are key features window openings provide important rhythmic elements decorative wood siding shingles and wood trim stone and brick work are important features roof form the craftsman roof is the defining element providing shallow pitched gables wide eaves and exposed rafter tails windows and doors windows are often elaborate multipaned vertically proportioned with a two over three or three over two pattern wide wood frames and mullions are typical doors can be highly decorative with arts and crafts elements of stained or leaded glass wood frames and trim have important detailing elements decorative wood trim  shingle siding  stone clinker brick and brick as base  elaborate wood doors and window trim  stained glass  leaded or etched glass  detailed light fixtures 3 craftsman bungalow faade composition h prairiefoursquare 1 introduction this section describes two similar architectural styles the prairie school architectural style developed primarily by frank lloyd wright and the american foursquare or prairie box the frank lloyd wright prairie style is typified by broad horizontal lines and open floor plans that represent the expansive midwest prairies but also reflect a japanese influence regarding detail that inspired wright the foursquare style more typically demonstrates a regular square construction  more vertical in feeling a fullwidth front porch is often part of the design other than these basic form differences the two architectural styles have much in common and are closely related wide eaves window styles and use of similar materials including stucco with wood trim solid wood siding and different masonry brick and stone veneers the most important theme is one of balance and harmony 2 prairiefoursquare typical characteristics massing picturesque irregular rectilinear forms for prairie or regular forms for foursquare prairie style will have low flat or hipped rooflines with a wide linear look foursquare can have low or slightly steeper pitched hip roofs with wide eaves but a more vertical look faade composition faades for both prairie and foursquare are regular with balanced window and door placement prairie may have more diversity of faade with different rectilinear projections but the overall look will still be balanced materials may be a wide combination of stucco brick stone and wood the critical element is balance roof form roof form is typically shallowpitched hipped style with wide eaves prairie style tends to have wider eaves than foursquare rafter tails may or may not be in evidence windows and doors windows provide important balanced rhythmic patterns for the design and reflect the japanese influence that forms some of the roots of the style elements windows with wood trim  strong compatible porch pillar design  combinations of materials with balanced design and pattern 3 prairiefoursquare faade composition i art decoart moderne 1 introduction art deco was the first widely popular style in the us to break with revivalist tradition represented by beauxarts and period houses art deco uses a style of decoration applied to jewelry clothing furniture handicrafts and buildings industrial designers used art deco designs to decorate streamlined cars trains and kitchen appliances art deco takes its name from the exposition internationale des arts decoratifs and industriels modernes held in paris 1925 a showcase for works of new inspiration and real originality the style strove for a modern and artistic expression to complement the machine age an emphasis on the future rather than the past was the styles principal characteristic both art deco and its cousin art moderne were rarely used for houses  they were more common for commercial buildings and skyscrapers and occasional institutional buildings the styles were most popular in new york city though they ultimately diffused widely across the country 2 identifying features a art deco smooth wall surface often stucco  smoothfaced stone and metal  polychrome often with vivid colors  forms simplified and streamlined  geometric designs including zigzags chevrons  towers and other vertical projections presenting a vertical emphasis  machined and often metallic construction materials for decorative features b art moderne smooth rounded wall surfaces often stucco  flat roof with small ledge at roofline  horizontal grooves or lines in walls sometimes fluted or pressed metal  asymmetrical faade  casementcorner windows or other horizontally arranged windows  metal balustrades  glassblock windows often curved unlike art deco art moderne expresses an emphasis on the horizontal 3 art decoart moderne typical characteristics massing art decosmooth walled with highly decorated insets often with tower element modernesmooth walled rounded forms more horizontal elements often the style includes both concepts as in a vertical design with rounded corners faade composition highly decorated walls and insets can be balanced or asymmetrical corner or casement windows vertical or horizontal design materials can be smooth coat stucco with accents of brick metal glass etc to emphasize modern machine technology roof form roof form is almost always flat with tower projections or decorative parapet decorative banding is often used to emphasize sculptural form windows windows provide an important decorative feature usually multiple panes arranged either vertically or horizontally storefronts onebay multiplebay or fullbuilding wide elements faade ornamentation is a key element modern materials like glass metal and bright colors are all important elements geometric designs like zigzags chevrons etc are important 4 art modernedeco faade composition j new urbanism 1 introduction a a growing reaction to modernist design and planning principles and suburban sprawl has led to the most recent trend in neighborhood design and urban development termed the new urbanism the fundamental tenet is to enhance community connections and alternative transportation modes while deemphasizing the automobile accompanying this peoplecentered development model is a call for green building techniques that leave a reduced footprint on the physical environment by the mid1990s the congress for the new urbanism provided detailed guidelines and philosophies for integrating neotraditional planning elements into existing urban places and new urban or suburban developments the term neotraditional refers to the notion that the new urbanism actually looks to old urbanism for its inspiration namely the types of early 20thcentury neighborhoods that were designed to accommodate pedestrians mass transit and to a lesser extent the automobile b thus newurbanist developments since the 1990s tend to include communityoriented features such as houses built close to the street parallel parking alleyways side or rearloading garages mixeduse buildings with retail residential andor commercial space narrow streets historically inspired architectural styles and diverse mixtures of housing types and sizes to accommodate a wider range of income groups ideally all of this is tied into larger metropolitan transportation networks with easy access to mass transit such as light rail or bus c there is an environmental rationale for such development as well including the use of less land per given population and ideally the use of green building methods that have gained much more attention since the 1990s several early prototype developments from the 1980s and 1990s still serve as the models for the new urbanism including the communities of seaside and celebration both in florida 2 new urbanism typical characteristics massing massing is variable depending on whether the project is mixed use multistory with housing on upper floors or housing adjacent to commercial development massing for multistory structures will have breaks and projections to visually differentiate uses and reduce bulk forms range from simple rectilinear shapes to elaborate reflections of past architectural styles structures will often incorporate courtyards and plaza space faade composition faades will have extensive detail and regular or irregular bays roof form roofs may be flat or pitched gable forms depending upon the architectural theme windows and doors windows and doors must reflect the architectural theme and provide definition for the different uses if the project is mixed use elements providing pedestrian connectivity to community areas is one of the most important elements of new urbanism residential front porches and stoops close to public sidewalks enhance community interaction and connection parking and garages are located behind the buildings and are treated as secondary in importance to the pedestrian scale goals narrow streets with ample pedestrian pathways are key elements 3 new urbanism mixed use faade composition  2012
