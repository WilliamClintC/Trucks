extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions both inside and outside the identified special flood hazard areas causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages art 1  b 4152014 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands art 1  c 4152014 objectives the objectives of this chapter are to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric

devices a any existing approved backflow preventer shall be allowed by the city if it meets the department of healths standards to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supercede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health b where the degree of hazard has increased as in the case of a residential installation converting to a business establishment any existing backflow preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure principal device or a reduced pressure principal device must be installed in the event no backflow device was present c any existing backflow preventers will be tested within 90 days of their identification ix 1252000 other violations and penalties a refusal of inspection if the owner refuses to allow the city to perform the necessary inspections to determine if a cross connection exists the city shall require that reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly be installed at that service connection b refusal to eliminate hazard if the owner after having been informed that a cross connection exists at his property refuses to eliminate or protect the cross connection though the use of the appropriate backflow preventer within the department of health regulations time limits 90 days for high hazard and one year for low hazard water service to the

channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land disturbance activity and construction activity sites is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety therefore the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation  12202005 applicability a this division shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan applications unless eligible for an exemption or granted a

part of a larger common plan of development that meets the applicability criteria of this section even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules b to prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff the aea has developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new development sites or modifications to
