will be determined by the highest daily volume pounds of bod and pounds of suspended solids discharged into the sanitary sewer system measured by averaging the highest three consecutive days during the prior fiscal year the three determining factors for industrial capacity will not necessarily peak during the same period new industrial users will estimate their plant capacity requirements and make periodic deposits as determined by the director during their first year of operation with an adjustment billing or credit whichever the case may be within thirty days after the end of the fiscal year if the period of operation during the first fiscal year is not sufficient to determine a plant capacity the second year operation capacity requirements will be used as if the industry was a new user in that year 2 actual discharges the operation and maintenance costs will be based on the actual volume pounds of bod and suspended solids it will be the industrial users responsibility to provide composite samples of its discharges for determining the bod and suspended solid testing each sample shall be marked with the beginning and ending meter reading of the volume discharge during the period the composite sample is taken the volume measured by the meter readings and the test results of the composite samples will be used to calculate the pounds of bod and suspended solids and

of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners the need to protect citizens from flooding is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter shall be quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  part 2010  conditions for variances a variances to allow wet floodproofing of new or substantially improved non residential structures may be issued for the following categories of structures  structures functionally dependent upon close proximity to water   accessory structures used solely for parking twocar detached garages or smaller or limited storage small lowcost sheds  and  agricultural structures used exclusively in connection with the production harvesting storage drying or raising of agricultural commodities including the raising of livestock b variances may also be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property the floodplain administrator may record a copy of the notice in the office of the sutter county recorder which shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  part 2010  city council guidelines a in passing upon requests for variances the live oak city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws or ordinances c variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a d are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  part 2010  appeals the city council of the city of live oak shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter  part 2010  warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions flood heights may be increased by man made or natural causes this chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages this chapter

purpose  development impact fee  limited use of development impact fees  purpose in order to implement the goals and objectives of the live oak general plan to maintain existing levels of service and to mitigate the impacts on city streets parks and governmental police and fire facilities caused by anticipated new development within the city certain public improvements must be constructed as development occurs the city council of the city has determined that a development impact fee is needed to finance these necessary public improvements and to pay a fair share of acquisition and improvement costs and other costs necessary to implement the goals and objectives of the live oak general plan and to maintain levels of service consistent with levels of service now enjoyed by citizens of the city the city council has determined that the application of the fee is consistent with the citys general plan and pursuant to of the government the state of california has considered the effects of the fee on meeting the citys housing needs as established in the housing element and other elements of the citys general plan  part 1992  development impact fee a a development impact fee is established on issuance of all permits entitling construction of or remodeling for change of use to create new residential units and new nonresidential facilities within the city to pay for costs of improvements necessitated thereby as described in the city council shall by ordinance set forth the specific amount of the fee to be imposed describe the benefit of the improvements required list the specific public improvements to be financed describe the estimated cost of the facilities and identify the reasonable relationship between the fee and different types of new development after the development impact fee has been established by ordinance the city council may from time to time adjust the development impact fee by resolution the development impact fee shall be paid by the developer or owner prior to the issuance of a building permit the city council may review the fees on an annual basis to determine whether the fee amounts are reasonably related to the burden of developments and whether the identified public facilities continue to be needed to serve the purposes identified in b the development impact fees imposed by this chapter are independent of and not related to existing city capacity and connection fees or fees collected for acquisition of park land pursuant to other sections of this code c the city council has determined based on a study and analysis in accordance with government et seq and following that a projected new development will create a demand for additional public improvements facilities and equipment to serve that new development at the same level of service enjoyed by current development in the city  b a direct relationship exists between the needed additional public improvements facilities and equipment and the new development and  c estimated costs of the necessary public improvements facilities and equipment to serve the new development are reasonable d the city council finds as follows 1 the purpose of the development impact fees is to offset costs of remodeling adding to or replacing existing facilities to meet the demands of additional development and growth 2 the development impact fees will be used specifically for the purposes outlined in the attached report entitled city of live oak ab1600 development impact fee analysis dated  as amended and attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference 3 the development impact fees will only be applied where there is a reasonable relationship between the land use and the public improvement or facility as described in the attached report cited above 4 the reasonable relationship between the need for the facilities to be funded by the fees and the specific development upon which the fees are imposed is as described in the attached report cited above 5 the reasonable relationship between the amount of the fees and the cost of the public facilities or portion thereof attributable to the development affected is as described in the

suretys obligations to the city are absolute and unconditional upon default of the principal it shall be no defense to the suretys obligations to the city that the principal is or has become insolvent or that the project which is the subject of the principals obligations is or has become economically infeasible in that regard doctrines such as frustration of purpose or commercial frustration or illegal forfeiture or similar doctrines shall not defeat the suretys absolute and unconditional obligation to the city upon the default of the principal the surety has specifically undertaken the risks that the principal may be or become insolvent or that the project which is subject of the principals obligation may presently or in the future lack commercial viability in the event the principal defaults in the performance of its obligations the surety may elect either directly or contractors to perform in the place of the principal if the surety elects to proceed in this fashion it shall provide written notice of such election to the city within thirty 30 days after surety becomes aware of the principals default if the surety elects to complete the obligations of the principal as opposed to paying money damages to the city occasioned by such breach the surety shall cause the obligations of the principal to be performed as soon as is reasonably possible but in no event later than nine 9 months following knowledge of the breach by the principal in the event the surety elects to perform the principals obligations the city shall be entitled to compel the surety by way of

portion of the work which comprises the principals obligation the citys city engineer shall determine the estimated cost of the uncompleted portion of the work and the surety shall make such deposit with the city within five 5 days of receipt of the city engineers estimate the city shall not be required to expend any of its own funds to complete the work nor to incur out of pocket damages inasmuch as the citys damages are measured by the value of its unfulfilled right namely the costs of completing the obligations of the principal by installing the bargainedfor improvements upon deposit of the estimated cost of completion with the city the city may proceed to bid the remainder of the work as a public project pursuant to the public contract the surety shall be obligated to continue to deposit such additional funds as may be necessary from timetotime until the improvements are complete and accepted by the city or until the surety has exhausted the penal sum of the bond should the surety deposit more funds than are necessary to satisfy the principals obligation then the city shall refund any balance remaining upon final acceptance of the improvements no interest shall be paid on any deposits made with the city underwriting assumptions and cost estimates of the surety shall not have any bearing whatsoever on the suretys liability under this bond by way of example if when making underwriting decisions regarding issuing this bond a cost estimate was prepared regarding the principals obligations to the city the fact that an item was omitted from the cost estimate which item was an obligation of the principal to the city shall in no way defeat or diminish the suretys obligation to the city with respect to this omitted item by way of further example if the underwriting decision to issue this bond included a cost estimate of items and a particular item was estimated at a cost significantly less than the amount actually required to perform such item this fact shall in no way defeat or diminish the suretys obligation to the city namely the surety shall be obligated to the full amount of the penal sum of the bond with respect to all matters which are the principals obligation to the city whether such items are actually included in any cost estimate or if so included are estimated at a cost far less than the actual cost to perform such items likewise the adequacy and amount of any premium and whether or not such premium was sufficient for the risk assumed by surety shall have no bearing on suretys absolute and unconditional obligation to

remedies by the city even though that election of remedies such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed obligation has destroyed the sureties rights of subrogation and

the remainder of the work as a public project pursuant to the public contract the surety shall be obligated to continue to deposit such additional funds as may be necessary from timetotime until the improvements are complete and accepted by the city or until the surety has exhausted the penal sum of the bond should the surety deposit more funds than are necessary to satisfy the principals obligation then the city shall refund any balance remaining upon final acceptance of the improvements no interest shall be paid on any deposits made with the city underwriting assumptions and cost estimates of the surety shall not have any bearing whatsoever on the suretys liability under this bond by way of example if when making underwriting decisions regarding issuing this bond a cost estimate was prepared regarding the principals obligations to the city the fact that an item was omitted from the cost estimate which item was an obligation of the principal to the city shall in no way defeat or diminish the suretys obligation to the city with respect to this omitted item by way of further example if the underwriting decision to issue this bond included a cost estimate of items

include damage to buildings in which cultivation occurs including improper and dangerous electrical alterations and use inadequate ventilation increased occurrences of homeinvasion robberies and similar crimes and nuisance impacts to neighboring properties from the strong and potentially noxious odors from the plants and increased crime b it is acknowledged that the voters of the state of california have provided a criminal defense to the cultivation possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes adoption of the compassionate use act in 1996 pursuant to proposition 215 and codified as health and safety 5 the compassionate use act cua does not address the land use or other impacts that are caused by the cultivation of medical marijuana c the purpose of this to adopt rules consistent with the cua and the medical marijuana program act mmpa commencing with health and safety 7 to regulate medical marijuana in a manner that protects the public health safety and welfare of the community and prevents adverse impacts which such activities may have on nearby properties and residents without interfering with the rights of qualified patients and their primary caregivers to possess or cultivate medical marijuana pursuant to state law d the cua is limited in scope in that it only provides a defense from criminal prosecution for possession and cultivation of marijuana to qualified patients and their primary caregivers the scope of the mmpa is also limited in that it establishes a statewide identification program and affords qualified patients persons with identification cards and their primary caregivers an affirmative defense to certain enumerated criminal sanctions that would otherwise apply to transporting processing administering or distributing marijuana e the cua and mmpa do not appear to have facilitated the stated goals of providing access to marijuana for patients in medical need of marijuana but instead the predominant use of marijuana has been for recreational and not medicinal purposes as the report issued by the california chiefs association on september 200 entitled california chiefs association position paper on decriminalizing marijuana states it has become clear despite the claims of use by critically ill people that only about 2% of those using crude marijuana for medicine are critically ill the vast majority of those using crude marijuana as medicine are young and are using the substance to be under the influence of thc tetrahydrocannabinol and have no critical medical condition california chiefs associations position paper on decriminalizing marijuana available at the planning department f facilities purportedly dispensing marijuana for medicinal purposes are commonly referred to as medical marijuana dispensaries medical marijuana cooperatives or medical marijuana collectives  however these terms are not defined anywhere in the cua or mmpa significantly nothing in the cua of mmpa specifically authorizes the operation and the establishment of medical marijuana dispensing facilities g further neither the cua nor mmpa require or impose an affirmative duty or mandate upon local governments such as the city of live oak to allow authorize or sanction the establishment and the operation and establishment of facilities dispensing medical marijuana within its jurisdiction moreover the cua did not create a constitutional right to obtain medical marijuana h it is critical to note that neither act abrogates the citys powers to regulate for public health safety and welfare health and safety b2 provides that the act does not supersede any legislation intended to prohibit conduct that endangers others in addition health and safety authorizes cities and counties to adopt and enforce rules and regulations consistent with the mmpa i on  edmond g brown the california attorney general issued guidelines for the security and nondiversion of marijuana grown for medical use the attorney general guidelines which sets regulations intended to ensure the security and nondiversion of marijuana grown for medical use by qualified patients health and safety d authorizes the attorney general

affirmative mandate or duty upon local governments such as the city of live oak to allow sanction or permit the establishment or the operation of facilities dispensing medical marijuana within their jurisdictional limits j marijuana remains an illegal substance under the federal controlled substances act 21 usc 801 et seq and is classified as a schedule i drug which is defined as a drug or other

furthermore the federal controlled substances act makes it unlawful for any person to cultivate manufacture distribute or dispense or possess with intent to manufacture distribute or dispense marijuana the controlled substances act contains no statutory exemption for the possession of marijuana for medical purposes the city does not wish to be in violation of federal law k pursuant to the city of live oaks police powers authorized in of the california constitution as well as under the city of live oak municipal the city has the power to regulate permissible land uses throughout the city and to enact regulations for the preservation of public health safety and welfare of its residents and community and pursuant to government the city also has the power city council to declare actions and activities that constitute a public nuisance l the city council finds that neither the cua nor the mmpa preempts the citys exercise of its traditional police powers in enacting land use and zoning regulations as well as legislation for preservation of public health safety and welfare such as this zoning ordinance prohibiting the establishment and operation of medical marijuana cooperatives and collectives within the city m the city council finds that the public health safety and general welfare of the city and its residents necessitates and requires the adoption of this zoning ordinance prohibiting the establishment and operation of medical marijuana cooperatives and collectives in order to a protect and safeguard against the detrimental secondary negative effects and adverse impacts of facilities dispensing medical marijuana  b preserve and safeguard the minors children and students in the community from the deleterious impacts of medical marijuana facilities  and c preserve the citys law enforcement services in that monitoring and addressing the negative secondary effects and adverse impacts will likely burden the citys law enforcement resources the city council further finds that due to negative secondary effects and adverse impacts of facilities dispensing medical marijuana the establishment and operation of these facilities will negatively impact the city n the zoning regulations are consistent with the live oak 2030 general plan in that the general plan its goals objectives and policies do not permit or contemplate the establishment or
