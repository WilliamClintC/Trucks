any interest in continuing the nonconforming use unless the owner can demonstrate an intent not to abandon the use an involuntary interruption of nonconforming use such as by fire and natural catastrophe does not establish the intent to abandon the nonconforming use however if any nonconforming use is halted for a period of one year or more the owner of the nonconforming use will be

in the granting of said variance the zoning board of review shall consider such factors as health and safety reasons and the financial feasibility of extending the utility lines to the lot it shall be considered financially unfeasible to extend utilities to the lot if the cost of such extension would exceed 50 percent of the value of the fully developed lot with street utilities etc but without a

regulations of the town including without limitation the requirement for planning board approval  and b all such resulting lots must be served by both public sewer and public water  and c all such resulting lots must meet all dimensional requirements of this chapter except those as to minimum area and frontage requirements  and the minimum frontage and lot width be reduced to 50 percent of that otherwise required for the zone in which the lot is located and the lot area may be reduced as follows 1 in the r80 zone if after subdivision into as many 80000 square foot lots as possible there remains a lot of 40000 square feet or more it may be created 2 in the r40 zone if after subdivision into as many as 40000 square foot lots as possible there remains a lot of 30000 square feet or more it may be created 3 in the r20 and r20sp zones if after subdivision into as many 20000 square foot lots as possible there remains a lot of 15000 square feet or more it may be created provided however that the planning board shall have the authority to require the subdivider to divide the merged lot into the same number of lots as would be allowed by this subsection but with the available lot area averaged over all such lots for example in the r20 zone if someone owns three lawfully existing adjacent nonconforming lots of 12000 square feet each these would be merged into one lot of 36000 square feet under the provisions of this subsection such lot could be subdivided into one 20000 square foot lot and one 16000 square foot lot  provided however that the planning board could instead require two 18000 square foot lots d in cases where the above standards cannot be met then a dimensional variance must be obtained from the zoning board of review in order to proceed with a subdivision application the zoning board may grant a dimensional variance for previously merged lots from the requirements of this merger provision wherein the zoning board may make a specific finding of fact that lots as unmerged will be of a size generally in conformance with the area of developed lots in the surrounding vicinity such lots shall further have the minimum width requirement of lots in that zone generally or at the very least shall have a lot width of not less than 80% of the lot width required for the underlying zone 2 adjacent lawfully established undeveloped lots or adjacent lawfully established developed and undeveloped lots in the same ownership in the os ei r15 r10 r10sw r8 and r6 zones which have less than the minimum area or frontage requirements shall be deemed to be merged

environment which encompasses the historic district zone included are stated policies to 1 maintain the character of bristol and make sure that new development does not adversely impact the character of the town  2 respect the historic resources that link bristols present with bristols past and use these resources as guidelines for managing future growth  3 foster the local economic base in general the goal of the land use element is to promote the development of a well balanced and functional mix of land uses and to ensure that development in the town is consistent with the towns character and image the historic downtown district is unique not only because of its well preserved historic structures but because of its small individualized shops and restaurants as well bristols historic downtown district is recognizable nationwide it attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors each year a large part of whom come to enjoy and experience the unique character of the nations most patriotic town and its numerous quaint shops and restaurants this unique character would be adversely affected by a proliferation of formula businesses which are required by contractual or other arrangements to be virtually identical to businesses in other communities as a result of standardized services merchandise decor uniforms and the like the development of such businesses if unchecked and unregulated would conflict with the distinct atmosphere and unique character for which bristols historic downtown district is famous therefore the town council finds that in order to preserve the

harmony with its natural features this is accomplished by allowing reduced lot sizes and locating lots on part of the overall parcel with the remaining area to be maintained as open space the plans and design standards for the development shall be such as to create architecture and landscaping which are attractive and outstanding and are in harmony with the open space these developments may include limited commercial uses to serve the residents of the land development project and reduce the need for automobile travel c zones where required and optional 1 required the following development options are required a in the r80 r40 and in any resource conservation and creative development overlay the rccd overlay zone a conservation development land development project shall be required 2 optional a cdldp shall be permitted where not required in only r8 r10 r15 and r20 zones upon approval by the planning board 3 process for review a cdldp shall be reviewed in accordance with

modification is required or where phasing is proposed shall be a major land development 4 waiver in accordance with the provisions of the town subdivision and development review regulations the planning board may grant a waiver from such regulations where such waiver is in the best interest of good planning practice andor design as evidenced by consistency with the towns comprehensive plan and this chapter pursuant to section 86 of the regulations and only with the appropriate findings as set forth therein such waiver may include provision for a socalled conventional subdivision but only in accordance with the aforementioned standards the planning board shall make such decision no later than master plan approval d minimum size of development and minimum percentage of open space there is no minimum size of development for a cdldp there shall be at least 50 percent open space only half of the required open space may be wetlands e computation of maximum number of dwelling units computation of the maximum number of dwelling units shall be as follows 1 density does not equate to minimum lot size the initial maximum density shall be determined by calculating the number of dwelling units or households which could reasonably be expected to be developed upon the site under a plan of a conventional subdivision or land development project that depicts the number of dwelling units on a parcel of land taking into account physical constraints to development known as a yield plan the maximum number of dwelling units on the yield plan as approved by the planning board as part of master plan approval shall be known as the initial maximum number 2 the applicant shall have the burden of proof with regard to the reasonableness and feasibility of the design and of the engineering specifications for such yield plan yield plans shall be prepared as conceptual layout plans in accordance with the preapplication checklist of the regulations yield plans shall show proposed streets lots rightsofway stormwater management facilities land unsuitable for development and other pertinent features although the yield plan must be drawn to scale it need not be based on a field survey however it must be a realistic layout reflecting a development pattern that could reasonably be expected to be implemented taking into account the presence of lands unsuitable for development and specific area required for preservation as defined in the regulations existing easements or encumbrances and the suitability of soils for subsurface sewage disposal 3 the yield plan shall also reflect the dimensional standards for uses being proposed as contained in the dimensional regulations of this zoning ordinance the yield plan shall identify how conventional lots or uses could be developed having the required area frontage and other dimensional requirements of this zoning ordinance 4 the initial maximum number determination shall be made during the preapplication stage of review the applicant shall use this initial determination as the basis for submission of more detailed information during subsequent stages of review upon further investigation and upon receipt of more detailed soils and environmental information as may be provided in subsequent stages of review the planning board may increase or reduce the number of lotsdwelling units contained in the initial maximum number in developments that require alterations to be made to freshwater wetlands the board may establish an initial maximum number contingent upon confirmation by the ri department of environmental management that such alterations are permitted under the provisions of the freshwater wetlands act for all developments the final initial maximum number shall be determined as part of the master plan stage of review 5 in addition to the initial maximum number the planning board may grant zoning incentives pursuant to the rigl  452447 to adjust the maximum density for the entire development  provided however that the maximum number of permitted new dwelling units site shall not be increased by a factor of more than 13 above the initial maximum number where granted multiple zoning incentives as provided below the initial maximum number of units plus any units allowed as zoning incentives shall equal the basic maximum number or units a if the planning board determines that the number of low and moderate income dwelling units exceed the minimum number otherwise required by this ordinance the initial maximum number of permitted dwelling units in the development may be increased by a factor of 12 b if the planning board determines that the amount of open space area provided in the entire cdldp exceeds the minimum required 50 percent the initial maximum number of permitted dwelling units in the development may be increased by a factor in accordance with the following table amount of open space provided increase in density factor 60%67% 11 67%75% 12 75% or greater 13 c if the planning board determines that at least onethird of the provided open space area is suitable for dedication to public use including active and passive recreation areas and such dedication to the public is made in perpetuity the initial maximum number of permitted dwelling units in the development may be increased by a factor of 12 the decision whether to accept an applicants offer to dedicate open space land to public usage within a proposed subdivision shall be at the discretion of the planning board which shall be guided by the comprehensive plan

example in july 2007 rih calculated the maximum affordable sales price of a singlefamily home for a bristol household of four earning 80 percent of the area median income to be $17000000 iii as an example based on the above variables as of july 200 the inlieu fee would be $15000000 per inclusionary unit required $32000000 median sales price  $17000000 maximum affordable sales price b all inlieu fees are to be deposited into the bristol affordable housing trust fund such funds may be expended or utilized only on the production of or rehabilitation of affordable housing units in bristol c

a fraction of a unit the applicant shall have the option of paying a cashinlieu of a fractional inclusionary unit whereby the payment is calculated by multiplying the inlieu fee for one unit calculated as per subsection 28370e1a by the fraction resulting from applying the 25 percent requirement this option is available when the calculation results in a fraction of less than 05 fractions of 05 or greater shall be rounded up to the next highest whole number for the purpose of calculating the payment in lieu for example an applicant proposing a fivelot subdivision would be required to provide two additional inclusionary units based on rounding up the 125 number derived from multiplying six house lots by 025 to establish the 25 percent requirement the example above estimates the perunit in lieu fee at $15000000 as of january 2007 based on that amount an applicant would have the option of paying $15000000 multiplied by 125 or $18750000 in lieu of constructing the required inclusionary units another option would be to build one unit while also providing a payment of $15000000 multiplied by 025 or $3750000 for the second unit f offsite option 1 offsite options the planning board at its sole discretion may allow any developer of an inclusionary project to comply with the requirements of subsection 28370b of the following offsite exactions a offsite

offsite units shall be in full compliance with all applicable construction and occupancy codes and shall be sufficiently maintained or rehabilitated so that all major systems meet standards comparable to new construction e the planning board in its sole discretion may further condition the use of any offsite option g preference of options 1 before considering the use of a payment in lieu or an offsite exaction the planning board must first make a finding that it would be infeasible as defined below to develop the affordable units onsite because of environmental public health public safety andor regulatory reasons 2 infeasible means any condition brought about by any single factor or combination of factors as a result of limitations imposed on the development by conditions attached to the approval of the subdivision to the extent that it makes it impossible for the applicant to proceed in building or operating low or moderate income housing without financial loss within the limitations set by the subsidizing agency of government on the size or character of the development on the amount or nature of the subsidy or on the tenants rentals and income permissible and without substantially changing the rent levels and unit sizes proposed by applicant 3 the following is the towns preferred progression of affordable housing options a first preference affordable units developed onsite b second preference payment of fee inlieu to meet all or a portion of the inclusionary unit requirement c third preference offsite options 1 offsite rehabilitation of affordable units in existing buildings 2 offsite new construction of affordable units 3 donation of one or more parcels of land suitable for residential development to be held by the affordable housing trust fund h affordability requirements all affordable housing units constructed pursuant to this article must qualify as low and moderate income housing units as defined in rigl tit 45 ch 53 to accomplish this an applicant shall at a minimum make the following submission in conjunction with the final plan 1 a town approved monitoring service agreement with a qualified organization  and 2 a town approved land

requirements and review timelines for the inclusionary housing plan and inclusionary housing agreement article x  signs footnotes  5  cross reference advertising ch 3 purpose and intent the purpose of this article is to 1 improve pedestrian and traffic safety  2 encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication and ensure that signs adequately identify uses and activities to the public  3 preserve and enhance the towns character  protect property values  and maintain and improve the visual quality of commercial areas which promotes the economic interests of the town by requiring new and replacement signs which a are welldesigned  b are compatible with the surroundings  c express the identity of the individual business owner  d have a style and form which relate to the place of business  e are of a size which is in scale with the building and the streetscape as a whole  and f are appropriately sized in context so as to be easily readable design guidelines a signs are one of the most prominent visual elements of a street welldesigned signs add interest and variety to building facades and help to attract customers in general the sign is the best representation of the business to the passing pedestrian or motorist b before starting to design a sign take a careful look at the building is there an obvious space on the building where the sign would look appropriate without covering architectural details some of the towns historic buildings were designed with a horizontal sign space stretching across the top of the storefront which should be used if this sign space does not exist perhaps there is adequate wall area for a wall sign with a vertical character or a projecting sign c take a look at neighboring buildings is there a predominant type of sign or a size precedent in designing a sign it is important to have an understanding not only of the building but also of the compatibility within the neighborhood the basis for decisions on sign type size and location should come from architectural concerns the specific definitions and regulations governing the various types of signs in this article should be studied before actual design begins for reference purposes the department of community development has examples and illustrations of signs which also may be reviewed d to achieve the objectives of this article the guidelines for sign details include the following 1 simplicity an effectively designed sign with bold easily recognized symbols and clear crisp lettering will identify a business or activity efficiently and attractively enhance the area in which it is located and complement the general appearance of the street and town 2 color restraint should be exercised when selecting colors on most signs no more than three colors should be used one for background a contrasting color for lettering and a third for perhaps emphasis such as for borders motifs or shading letter to give it a threedimensional look colors should be chosen which complement each other as well as the general tone of the building 3 message messages should be simple for rapid comprehension by the public pictures symbols and logos can add individuality and character to signs in addition to making them easier to read 4 materials sign materials shall be compatible with the surrounding area sign materials shall be consistent with or at least complement the original construction material and architectural style of the building facade on which they are to be displayed for these reasons material such as wood and metal are more appropriate than plastic although the historic district commission encourages creativity which respects the historic surroundings internallylit plastic signs are usually out of context with the period and style of historic buildings and are therefore not allowed 5 continuity of treatment signs on adjacent storefronts shall be coordinated in height and proportion 6 lettering lettering styles should complement the style and period of the building on which they appear traditional block and curvilinear styles which are easy to read are preferred generally different type

surrounding area and not due to an economic disability of the applicant  b that such hardship is not the result of any prior action of the applicant and does not result primarily from the desire of the applicant to realize greater financial gain  c that the granting of the requested variance will not alter the general characteristic of the surrounding area or impair the intent or purpose of this chapter or the comprehensive plan of the town  d that the relief to be granted is the least relief necessary  e the board shall in addition to the above standards require that evidence be entered into

ch 29  2912984 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from  article i  in general purpose a the town council hereby finds that excessive quantities of soil are eroding from certain areas that are undergoing development for nonagricultural uses such as storagefilling housing developments commercial construction industrial areas recreational facilities and roads much of this soil erosion is the result of poorly planned and implemented site grading and surface water runoff controls this runoff and resulting erosion results in conflicts andor damage with neighboring properties and their owners and makes costly repairs to drainage structures gullies washed out fills roads and embankments necessary the resulting sediment clogs the storm sewers road ditches and muddies streams leaves deposits of silt in ponds and reservoirs and is considered a major water pollutant b the purpose of this chapter is to prevent soil erosion excessive surface water runoff and sedimentation from occurring as a result of nonagricultural development within the town by requiring proper provisions for stormwater disposal and soil erosion during and after construction in order to promote the safety public health and general welfare of the town  applicability a this chapter shall be applicable to any situation involving disturbance to the terrain and its contours and topsoil or vegetative ground cover upon any property within the town after determination of applicability by the building official or hisher designee or by the planning board when the development associated with the land disturbance is within its jurisdiction in the cases within the planning boards jurisdiction the planning board shall retain authority for the review and approval of all control measures associated with the land disturbing activity and the building official shall retain enforcement responsibilities based upon criteria outlined in section 293 b compliance with the requirements described herein shall not be construed to relieve the applicant of any obligations to obtain necessary state or federal permits the building official shall notify appropriate state or federal agencies prior to issuance of a permit for a landdisturbing activity controlled by the provisions of this chapter the failure of the building official to notify any necessary state or federal agency shall not void any permit issued hereunder the term building official as used throughout this chapter means the building official or hisher designee  determination of applicability a it shall be unlawful for any person to disturb any existing vegetation grades or contours of land in a manner which may increase the potential for soil erosion without first applying for a determination of applicability from the building official upon determination of applicability the applicant shall submit a soil erosion runoff and sediment control plan for approval to the building official or to the planning board as provided in section 2926 the application for determination of applicability shall describe the location nature character and time schedule of the proposed landdisturbing activity in sufficient detail
