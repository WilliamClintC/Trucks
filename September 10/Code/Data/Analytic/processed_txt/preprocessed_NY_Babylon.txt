awareness that they are stewards of the air water land and living resources and that they have an obligation to protect the environment for the use and enjoyment of this and all future generations c the basic purpose of tobeqra is to incorporate the consideration of environmental factors into the existing planning review and decisionmaking processes of state regional and local government agencies at the earliest possible time to accomplish this goal tobeqra requires that all agencies determine whether the actions they directly undertake fund or approve may have a significant impact on the environment and if it is determined that the action may have a significant adverse environmental impact prepare or request an environmental impact statement d it is the intention of the town board of the town of babylon that the protection and enhancement of the environment human and community resources should be given appropriate weight with social and economic considerations in determining public policy and that those factors be considered together in reaching decisions on proposed activities accordingly it is the intention of this chapter that a suitable balance of social economic and

unlisted actions all agencies are subject to this type i list 1 this type i list is not exhaustive of those actions that an agency determines may have a significant adverse impact on the environment and that requires the preparation of an eis however the fact that an action or project has been listed as a type i action carries with it the presumption that it is likely to have a significant adverse impact on the environment and may require an eis for all individual actions which are type i or unlisted the determination of significance must be made by comparing the impacts which may be reasonably expected to result from the proposed action with the criteria listed in  1147c of this chapter 2 agencies may adopt their own lists of additional type i actions may adjust the thresholds to

received e the commissioner of the new york state department of environmental conservation will use the following criteria in order of importance to designate lead agency  whether the anticipated impacts of the action being considered are primarily of statewide regional or local significance ie if such impacts are of primarily local significance all other considerations being equal the local agency involved will be lead agency   which agency has the broadest governmental powers for investigation of the impacts of the proposed action  and  which agency has the greatest capability for providing the most thorough environmental assessment of the proposed action  notice of the commissioner of the new york state department of environmental conservations designation of lead agency will

there are numerous illegal accessory apartments in the town the planning department estimates that between 10% and 20% of what seemingly are onefamily dwellings are really onefamily dwellings with

encourage the residents of our community who require accessory apartments to legally remain in the town of babylon in addition this article will provide for the improved safety and physical appearance of the onefamily dwellings with accessory apartments and the surrounding neighborhoods its purpose is also to further preserve the onefamily residential character of the town and to continue to protect the health welfare and safety of the general public c it is the intent that any approved accessory apartment permits be for owneroccupied homes since the division of building in the department of planning and development has found that absenteelandlord twofamily homes disproportionately make up 50% of all twofamily home building complaints received even though only 10% of the twofamily homes are owned by absentee landlords d it is further recognized that many holders of accessory kitchen permits have legally converted their homes to onefamily dwellings with accessory apartments it

babylon that 1 land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species the great south bay and its tidal tributaries within the town of babylon have been placed on the new york state department of environmental conservation nysdec priority water bodies list the nysdec identified urban runoff and storm drain systems as the major sourcecontributors to their impairment 2 clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat 3 improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation 4 impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow 5 substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts to the waters of the town of babylon 6 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activity 7 the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases  18625 babylon code  1891   1892 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the residents of the town of babylon and to address the findings of fact and statutory authority in  1891 this chapter seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety 8 regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will result in development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development b therefore the town board of the town of babylon hereby establishes this policy applicable to all land development activities within the town of babylon to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff and erosion and sediment control

consumers who maintained that their vehicles had been legally parked when boots were applied that no signs had been posted indicating that vehicles would be booted if they were improperly parked or

business establishments where motorists were forced not only to pay high booting charges to have their vehicles released but also to pay charges for both the booting and the subsequent towing of their vehicles since booting is currently an unlicensed activity the town clerk has been unable to mediate any of these consumer complaints this article would authorize the town clerk to license private persons who boot motor vehicles and thereby hear and respond to complaints and provide for sanctions for any violation of this article and establish certain standards for any violation of this article

findings 1 the town board and the staff of the town of babylon reviewed land use studies of the location of tobacco advertising in proximity to schools parks and child daycare centers in addition the town has examined the actions and codes of other municipalities including the city of new york and the city of long beach 2 the town board of the town of babylon finds that restricting the exposure of minors to advertising regarding tobacco and tobacco products is constitutional when achieved targeted limitations on such advertising in the vicinity of schools and other locations where it is well established that children tend to congregate it is the intention of the town board to enhance and augment compliance with and enforcement of federal state and local laws prohibiting the sale or distribution of tobacco products to minors and to protect such minors against such illegal sales 3 the center for disease control and prevention has reported that while the rate of adult smoking of tobacco products has decreased nationwide by 50% between 1971 and 199 the rate of smoking among all high school students has increased by 26% during the years 1991 and 199 and now stands at the highest rate since 1981 it is further noted that this dramatic increase has occurred contrary to and at variance with the laws of all 50 states prohibiting sale and distribution of tobacco products to minors and the pledge of all tobacco product manufacturers to adhere to a voluntary industry code prohibiting advertising of such products in a manner appealing to minors 4 in 199 a study of the journal of the american medical association concluded that cigarette advertising encourages youth to smoke and should be banned in 199 a report of the national institute of medicine stated that the substantial convergent evidence that advertising and promotion increase tobacco use by youth is impressive andprovided a strong basis for legal regulation in 199 a report of the federal center for disease control and prevention found that cigarette marketing practices appeared to be the most likely account for the increase in teen smoking initiation rates 5 in 199 liggett & myers inc a cigarette manufacturer made the following acknowledgement in executing a settlement agreement with the attorney generals of 17 states including the state of new  213252 water  213252  york liggett acknowledges that the tobacco industry markets to youth which means those under 18 years of age 6 based upon the preponderance of the evidence that tobacco products are advertised and promoted to minors and that the rate of use of tobacco products by minors has drastically increased contrary to legislation prohibiting the sale or distribution of such products to minors the town board of the town of babylon hereby finds and declares it to be in the best interests of minors residing andor otherwise present within the town to enact affirmative reasonable and constitutionally permissible restrictions on the advertising of tobacco products 7 by enacting this legislation it is the intent of the town board to promote compliance with an enforcement of federal state and local laws prohibiting sale or distribution of tobacco products to minors and therefore in deference to the protections afforded by the first amendment to the constitution of the united states this legislation has been narrowly crafted to place reasonable time place and manner restrictions on such advertising in those locations where it is well established that minors tend to congregate while not imposing

classification or boundary whether included in zoning of the town otherwise may be adopted amended changed modified or repealed by the town board by adoption of a local law and such local law shall be deemed to have been approved and adopted by a favorable vote of a simple majority of the entire town board and shall then take full force and effect as provided a the health safety and welfare of the community cannot be adequately protected by the town board unless it can speedily effect changes of land use regulations when the need for such action is clearly shown however certain provisions of the new york town law have proven to be detrimental to towns by impairing the ability of a town board to speedily enact needed changes in zoning and land use regulations even when such changes are desired by the overwhelming majority of town residents and a majority of their elected representatives with the result that sound planning and orderly growth has often been undermined and the will of the electorate thwarted b in order to achieve the objectives of protecting the established character of neighborhoods especially residential neighborhoods the social and economic wellbeing of residents and the value of private and public property and in order to prevent the overcrowding of land or buildings to avoid the undue and unnecessary concentration of population and to lessen and when possible to prevent traffic congestion on the public streets and highways the town board desires to utilize a proven mechanism to accomplish the above objectives c the constitution and the municipal home rule law of the state of new york provide a mechanism for remedying this situation and permitting the adoption and amendment of land use regulations by local law by a simple majority vote of the town board and the use of such mechanism is an appropriate way for the town board to deal with the recent unprecedented redevelopment of the town and the obvious need to update and amend
