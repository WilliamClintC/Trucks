has in the flood control insurance act vtca water  delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city of nacogdoches texas does ordain as follows  findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city of nacogdoches are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future floodblight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area  methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  secs 4254215  reserved division 2  reserved secs 42164225  reserved article ii  generally title this article shall

article is to provide for the creation of planned development zoning districts these districts are intended to provide for the development of land as an integral unit for single or mixed use in accordance with a plan that may vary from the established regulations of other zoning districts the planned development pd district is intended to implement the goals and objectives of the citys comprehensive plan it is also meant to encourage flexible and creative planning to ensure the compatibility of land uses to allow for the adjustment of changing demands to meet the current needs of the community and to provide for a development that is superior to what could be accomplished in other zoning districts by meeting one or more of the following purposes 1 provides for a superior design of lots or buildings 2 provides for increased recreation andor open space opportunities for public use 3 provides amenities or features that would be of special benefit to the property users or community 4 protects or preserves natural amenities and environmental assets such as trees creeks ponds floodplains and slopes or hills 5 protects or preserves existing historical buildings structures

elements into a master plan for the whole district 2 development plan this plan is intended to be used most often as the second step of the planned development process the development plan contains all the information of a concept plan but includes more detailed information as to the specific land uses and their boundaries the purposes of a development plan are to ensure that the development project proceeds in orderly fashion consistent with the approved concept plan and to ensure that the standards applicable within the district are met for each phase of the project a development plan may also be used to establish the district 3 planned development site plan the planned development site plan is the final step of the planned development process the purposes of a planned development site plan are to ensure that the development of individual building lots parcels or tracts within a project are consistent with the approved development plans and to ensure that the standards applicable within the district are met for each individual building site art viii  31b 1131998 notice hearing and written protests approval of concept plans and development plans are considered
