in the future the plan shall describe conceptually how such improvements can be accommodated  3 overall the plan achieves a housing density that is within 80 to 100 percent of planned densities consistent with the comprehensive plan and development   and 4 the plan reserves land needed for public use eg schools parks fire stations and other facilities in accordance with the comprehensive plan and to the extent allowed under applicable law e implementation the conceptual master plan required by this section must be submitted during the preapplication meeting for the land use application or annexation petition as applicable the city may also refer the plan to outside agencies with jurisdiction for their input the master plan is not binding but the applicant is encouraged to refine the plan based on city input before submitting a land use application or annexation petition for the subject property the applicant should also contact adjacent property owners and solicit their input prior to submitting a land use application pursuant to  17 lot size averaging flag infill development a lot size averaging to allow flexibility in subdivision design and to address physical constraints such as topography existing development significant trees and other natural and built features the approval body may grant a 20 percent modification to the lot area andor lot dimension widthdepth standards in provided that the overall density of the subdivision does not exceed the allowable density of the district and the approval body finds that all of the following are met 1 granting the modification is necessary to achieve planned housing densities as allowed by the underlying zone or to improve development compatibility with natural features or adjacent land uses  2 the planning official may require screening buffering or other transitions in site design where substandard lots are proposed to abut standard or largersized lots b flag lots may be created only

block midblock lanes are a private drives serving more than two dwelling units with reciprocal access easements  such lanes are an alternative to requiring public rightofway street improvements where physical site constraints preclude the development of a standard street midblock lanes at a minimum shall be paved have adequate storm drainage surface retention where feasible is preferred meet the construction standards for alleys and conform to the standards of subsections d and e d emergency vehicle access a drive serving more than one lot shall have a reciprocal access and maintenance easement recorded for all lots it serves no fence structure or other obstacle shall be placed within the drive area where required emergency vehicle apparatus lanes including any required turnaround

this  17 intent adjustments are variances that are intended to provide relief from code standards in specific situations both procedures are intended to ensure that the resulting development is compatible with adjacent properties and is consistent with the intent of the adjustments adjustments provide relief from specific code provisions when a code provision has the unintended effect of preventing reasonable development in conformance with all other code requirements adjustments are allowed in limited situations pursuant to b variances variances provide greater flexibility to code standards than adjustments where the physical characteristics of a site or its surroundings prevent reasonable development in compliance with a code standard  17 adjustments adjustments are minor modifications to code standards that are intended to provide reasonable flexibility for planned land uses and development adjustments are subject to the following standards and procedures permitted uses as provided in division ii shall not be adjusted a applicability the planning official or planning commission type ii procedure may adjust the following standards 1 setbacks up to a 20 percent reduction to a minimum setback 2 lot coverage up to a 20 percent increase to the maximum lot coverage 3 lot dimensions up to a 20 percent decrease to a minimum lot dimension 4 lot area up to a 20 percent decrease in minimum lot area 5 other dimensional standards up to a 20 percent increase or decrease in a quantitative numerical standard not listed above this option is limited to standards in division ii tables 17d and 17e and special use standards and division iii  it does not include building code requirements engineering design standards public safety standards or standards implementing state or federal requirements as determined by the planning official b approval criteria the city may grant an adjustment only upon finding that all of the following criteria are met the burden is on the applicant to demonstrate compliance with the criteria 1 the adjustment allows for a building plan that is more compatible with adjacent land uses or it does not create a conflict with adjacent uses  2 the adjustment is necessary to allow for normal interior building functions such as mechanical equipmentutility closets heating and ventilation systems restrooms stockrooms shelving and similar interior building functions  3 approval of the adjustment does not create a violations of any other adopted ordinance or code standard and b does not create the need for a variance  4 an application for an adjustment is limited to one lot per application  5 requests for more than one adjustment on the same lot shall be consolidated on one application and reviewed concurrently by the city  6 not more than three adjustments may be approved for one lot or parcel in a continuous 12month period  and 7 all applicable building code requirements and engineering design standards shall be met  17 variances a applicability a variance is similar to an adjustment but does not otherwise meet the criteria under b approval criteria the planning commission type iii procedure may approve a variance upon finding that it meets all of the following criteria 1 the variance is necessary because the subject does not account for special or unique physical circumstances of the subject site existing development patterns or adjacent land uses a legal lot determination may be sufficient evidence of a hardship for purposes of approving a variance  2 the variance is the minimum necessary to address the special or unique physical circumstances related to the subject site  3 the need for the variance is not selfimposed by the applicant or property owner for example the variance request does not arise as a result of a property line adjustment or land division approval previously granted to the applicant  4 the variance does not conflict with other applicable city policies or other applicable regulations  5 the variance will result in no foreseeable harm to adjacent property owners or the public  and 6 all applicable building code requirements and engineering design standards shall be met  17 expiration approvals granted under shall expire if not acted upon by the property owner within one year of the city approving the variance where the owner has applied for a building permit or final plat has made site improvements consistent with an approved development plan eg site design review or preliminary subdivision plan or provides other evidence of working in good faith toward completing the project the planning official may extend an approval accordingly  master planned developments 17 purpose the purposes of are to a implement the comprehensive plan by providing a means for master planning large development sites as an alternative to piecemeal subdivision development  b encourage innovative planning that results in projects that benefit the community for example efficiency in land use improved protection of open spaces transportation efficiency and housing choices  c encourage housing options for a range of household sizes incomes and lifestyles  d encourage mixeduse development and diversified employment opportunities  e promote an economic arrangement of land use buildings circulation systems open space and utilities  f preserve to the greatest extent possible the existing landscape features and amenities that may not otherwise be protected development  g encourage energy efficiency and improved air and water quality  h implement public facility master plans  and i provide flexibility in development standards consistent with the above purposes  17 applicability the master planned development designation may be applied over any of the citys zoning districts it is an option available to developers of land  17 review and approvals process a review steps there are three required steps to master planned development approval which may be completed individually or combined for concurrent review 1 application for master planned development concept plan approval  2 application for detailed development plan approval which may include a preliminary subdivision plan  and 3 applications for final development plan eg final plat andor site design review approval b approval process 1 the master planned development concept plan

the type ii procedure in to ensure substantial compliance with the approved concept plan 3 site design review applications for approved planned developments shall be reviewed using a type ii procedure in to ensure substantial compliance with the approved concept plan 4 steps 1 above may be combined in any manner so long as the decisionmaking sequence follows the above order notification and hearings may be combined  17 modifications to development standards the standards of divisions ii and iii may be modified master plan development process without the need for variance under  in evaluating this criterion the planning commission shall consider whether the proposal on balance exceeds the citys minimum requirements and provides greater community benefits than would otherwise occur under the base development in evaluating community benefits the planning commission shall apply the following criteria  the city may deny an application for master planned development concept plan approval that does not meet all of the following criteria a comprehensive plan the modification does not conflict with the comprehensive plan a master planned development may exceed the maximum residential density minimum lot size permitted by the underlying zone provided that the overall density of the project average of total dwelling units per acre is not greater than 110 percent of the density permitted by the underlying zone b purpose and intent of development modification equally or better meets the purpose and intent of the development s to be modified as compared to a project that strictly conforms to code standards c public benefit the modification provides a net benefit to the public by one or more of the following 1 greater variety of housing types or lot sizes than would be achieved under the base development   2 more open space or more usable open space than would be required under the base development   3 greater protection of natural features than would be required under the base development   4 avoidance of natural hazards eg geological hazards river resources or flood hazards  and 5 improved transportation connectivity such as the provision of pathways andor other transportation facilities that would not otherwise be provided pursuant to base development d engineering design standards modifications to the citys public works design standards

time a decision shall be rendered by the review committee not more than 10 business days after the last evidentiary session m pursuant to the hazardous materials containment and mitigation review the review committee may find that the use project or establishment includes or proposes to include use of regulated materials that 1 are in fact below the established minimum thresholds of concern and require no other regulatory action  2 are deemed too dangerous either alone or in combination with other materials either proposed for use by the applicant or preexisting in the proximate area to

meeting the criteria for approval thereby requiring denial of a hazardous materials permit  4 are above the established minimum threshold or contained in combination so as to be of concern but may be granted a hazardous materials permit subject to certain conditions such conditions of approval may include but are not limited to a restrictions on the quantity of regulated materials allowed to be on site b prohibitions against certain combinations of regulated materials being on site or within certain proximity of each other c special conditions for storage  the application of best technology d additional buffering or containment controls  provisions for regular andor spot compliance inspections reporting and inventory requirements andor periodic updating of emergency response plans e notice to the fire department when materials are brought on site f other mitigation measures as determined by the committee to be appropriate to the specific application and circumstances such that upon implementing and maintaining the conditions of approval the risk that a proposed use project or establishment will be a danger to public health or safety is significantly reduced n if the committee finds that the applicant fails to meet the criteria and denies the issuance of a hazardous materials permit the denial shall not have bearing on other aspects of the use project or establishment or on the use of other regulated materials for which a permit has or may be issued nor shall denial of the hazardous materials permit preclude approval of any land use action building or engineering permit o if the committee denies the application for a hazardous materials permit the applicant may upon proper application and payment of the appropriate fee appeal to the molalla city council any such appeal shall be filed within 7 days from the date the notice of decision was mailed if no appeal is filed within 7 days the citys decision on the permit shall become final on the 8th day after the notice of decision was mailed a hearing before the council shall be based on the record compiled during the hazardous materials containment and mitigation review notice of appeal shall be provided to all participants in the hazardous materials containment and mitigation review process the criteria for decisions by the council shall be those listed in this waived by the applicant any decision of the review committee shall be rendered within 120 days of the date when the original application was deemed complete notwithstanding any other provision of this the decision of the council is final p because of the above procedure it is not necessarily a full engineering and structural or fire of the construction plans and specifications participation in this process does not preclude further investigation analysis and requirements at the building permit stage of development however an applicant may submit the materials and information developed for the hazardous materials screening or containment and mitigation review towards satisfaction of those requirements q if the committee finds the applicant fails to meet the criteria in this section and denies issuance of a hazardous materials permit but the applicant changes the process procedures or use of the regulated material in question and prepares detailed plans and specifications clearly demonstrating that the approval can be met the applicant may upon proper application and payment of appropriate fees file for reconsideration by the committee r except as provided herein any affidavit exemption certificate or hazardous materials permit presented to the city pursuant to the requirements of this chapter shall apply only to the specific use project or establishment in question  shall remain valid throughout
