regulatory code 361 title this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the cable communications regulatory code  362 purpose and intent a purpose the village finds that further development of cable systems has the potential to be of great benefit to the village and its residents and businesses cable technology is rapidly changing and cable plays an essential role as part of the villages basic infrastructure cable systems  sterling codifiers inc  87338 extensively make use of scarce and valuable public rights of way in a manner different from the way in which the general public uses them and in a manner reserved primarily for those who provide services to the public such as utility companies a cable company currently typically faces very limited competition  thus the grant of a franchise has the effect of giving the holder extensive economic benefits and places the holder in a position of public trust because of these facts the village finds that public convenience safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers vested in the village or such persons as the village so designates to protect the public and to ensure that any franchise granted is operated in the public interest in light of the foregoing the following goals among others underlie the provisions set forth in this chapter 1 cable service should be available to as many village residents and businesses as possible and provide the widest possible diversity of information sources and services to the public 2 a cable system should be capable of accommodating both present and reasonably foreseeable future cable related needs of the community 3 a cable system should be constructed and maintained during a franchise term so that changes in technology may be integrated to the maximum extent possible into existing system facilities taking into account all relevant factors including costs 4 a cable system should grow and develop and be responsive to the needs and interests of the community b intent the village intends that all provisions set forth in this chapter be construed to serve the public interest and the foregoing public purposes and that any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter be construed to include the foregoing findings and public purposes as integral parts thereof  363 applicability to existing franchises and agreements to the

working group on the regulation of sexually oriented business hubert h humphrey iii attorney general for the state of minnesota  and appendix d summaries of secondary effects reports preface to the second edition community defense counsel the village board of trustees finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this article as adult theaters and cabarets engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 at least fifty 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 198 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the hiv antibody test 8 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 9 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 10 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 11 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 12 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 13 reasonable zoning and licensing procedures are appropriate mechanisms to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such procedures will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the village it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 14 the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the village will be promoted by the enactment of this article 15 the findings noted in subsections b1 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns 16 the findings and opinions of the cases and studies as related in the opening of this subsection b are the

intent a title this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the educational facilities impact fee ordinance b legislative intent as a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or of a final plat of a planned unit development each subdivider or developer shall be required to dedicate land for school purposes to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development or shall be required to make a cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication or a combination of both at the option of the village of glen carbon the village and with the concurrence of

cash contributions required hereunder shall be made in accordance with the criteria and formulas herein  1162 criteria for school site dedication cash contribution or both a criteria for requiring school site dedications 1 population ratio the ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly on the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites the land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of the estimated number of children to be served in each school classification as described in subsection a2 of this section from the subdivision or planned unit development over the maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school classification as stated herein and then applying such ratio to the appropriate number of acres for a school site of each such school classification as stated herein the product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increase in number of students for each such school classification 2 school classifications and acreage these requirements for acreage are based upon a review of available data studies and literature on the subject including but not limited to information provided by the state superintendent of education and the unique characteristics of glen carbon and madison county including its generally rural character and open spaces and the desire of the residents to maintain this character and open space in future school sites these requirements for acreage shall be presumed as the appropriate acreage requirements and shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land dedication herein unless timely objected to as provided herein objections to these acreage requirements for any particular development shall be made in accordance with section 1169 of this chapter to the planning and zoning commission failure to timely object to these acreage requirements in accordance with section 1169 of this chapter shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time school classifications and size of school sites serving the village shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria school classification by grades maximum number of students for each such school classification appropriate number of acres of land for each school site of such classification elementary schools grades kindergarten or 6th 450 25 junior high or middle schools grades 6th or 7th and 8th 600 40 high schools grades 9th  70 3 location the standards adopted by district 7 shall be used as a guideline in locating sites school sites shall be located in the village in accordance with plans heretofore or hereafter adopted by district 7 b criteria for requiring cash contribution when the development is small and the resulting site to be dedicated is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for a school site or is in conflict with the approved standards or plan of district 7 the village with the concurrence of district 7 shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication the cash contribution in lieu of dedication of school sites and any and all interest earned thereon shall be held in trust by district 7 or other public body designated by the village and shall be used for the acquisition of land for school sites to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or development or for the improvement to any existing school site that already serves such needs or for the construction of school buildings or additions thereto in accordance with public act 930330 or for any purpose defined by agreement with the subdivider or developer at the time of platting if any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of dedication of school sites is not expended for the purposes set forth herein within thirteen 13 years from the date of receipt it shall be refunded by the entity holding the contribution to the record owner of the subdivided land at the time of the refund if there is more than one record owner of the subdivided land or of the land that comprises the planned unit development as applicable such record owners shall share in the refund pro rata based on the cash contributions originally paid by each property  sterling codifiers inc  320338 1 fair market value in the interest of developing an impact fee that is relatively uniform throughout district 7 territory the cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on thirty five percent 35% of the maximum possible impact fee generated under the formulas described in this chapter in calculating the fair market value on a per acre basis unless determined otherwise pursuant to section 1169 of this chapter the following assumptions about the land shall be made a that it is zoned in a onefamily dwelling residential zoning district consistent with the villages development standards  b that it is subdivided with appropriate frontage on a dedicated street or road stubbed with municipal sewer and water has all appropriate utilities available  c that it is improved as set forth in sections 1165 and 1166 of this chapter  and d that it is otherwise property capable of being used for residential development based upon a study of real estate transactions in the village for the past three 3 years it has been determined that the present fair market value of such improved land in and surrounding the village is as of the effective date hereof one hundred thirty five thousand dollars $13500000 per acre these figures shall be adjusted by the village board from time to time with appropriate study and documentation the fair market value as defined above shall be used in calculating any cash contribution in lieu of land dedication required herein unless timely objected to as provided in section 1169 of this chapter objections to the fair market value as defined above shall be made in accordance with section 1169 of this chapter to the planning and zoning commission failure to timely object to the fair market value as defined above in accordance with section 1169 of this chapter shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time 2 consumer price index the fair market value identified in subsection b1 of this section shall be subject to a cpi adjustment which shall be calculated on  and on january 1 in each year thereafter annually the fixed charge shall be adjusted by the annual percentage change as published by the united states department of labors bureau of labor statistics all items consumer price index cpi for urban consumers 19821984   100 for the st louis missouriillinois area if any index is calculated from a base different from the base period 19821984   100 such index shall be converted to a base period of 19821984   100 by use of a conversion factor supplied by said bureau of labor statistics if the cpi is discontinued or replaced such other governmental cost of living index or computation which replaces the cpi shall be used in order to obtain substantially the same result as would be obtained if the cpi had not been discontinued or replaced c criteria for requiring dedication and contribution there will be situations in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a cash contribution in lieu of land are both necessary these occasions will arise when 1 only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a school site that portion of the land within the subdivision falling within the school location shall be dedicated as a site as stated above and a cash
