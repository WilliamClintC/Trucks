storage of salt and saltmixtures is in all cases discouraged 2 if the well is or will be located within 2500 feet of existing abandoned or proposed potential source of groundwater pollution the land pollution control division of the state board of health should first be consulted concerning a recommended separation from the facility 3 if the distance requirements as set forth in this subchapter cannot be met due to conditions at the well site consultation should be made with the city for the possible waiver based on special construction or on favorable geological conditions as may qualify by the interpretation of regulatory agencies having further jurisdiction over these matters  use of wells for drainage purposes prohibited the use of a well for the disposal of sewage or of other material which may pollute the potable groundwater is prohibited  disinfection samples and report disinfections 1 to prevent contamination of the well or aquifer it is desirable to maintain a chlorineresidual of 200 parts per million ppm or an alternative approved by the state board of health in the well hole during the drilling process this excludes monitoring wells under these conditions the well need not be disinfected until the pump is set every new modified or reconditioned water source including pumping equipment and gravel used in gravel wall wells shall be disinfected before being placed in service for general use city of auburnordinances water chapter 53 this treatment shall be performed both when the well work is finished and when the pump is installed or when the pump is reinstalled in the well 2 if there is no significant lapse of time between the two operations only the later disinfection will be so required the well or other pumping equipment and gravel used in gravel wall well construction shall be disinfected with a solution containing enough of chlorine to leave a residual of 25 parts per million in the well after a period of at least 24 hours water samples after pumping the well to remove all disinfectant a water sample shall be collected by the well owner or representative from the well and submitted for laboratory analysis to the state board

intended service or original use or intent shall be constructed to the identical procedures as prescribed herein for permanent abandonment  geothermal heat pump system standards purpose potable groundwater is one of mans most precious natural resources the improper well drilling and geothermal heat pump system installation procedures and installations may pollute the available supply of groundwater in and around the city to guide drillers and owners in the construction of geothermal heat pump systems the city establishes the following standards to protect its groundwater from contamination by less than recognized installation methods availability of groundwater the availability of groundwater is an initial consideration in determining whether an openloop or closedloop system shall be used in areas where the available groundwater is limited or where there is a high density of wells existing special consideration and construction techniques may be required for an openlooped system the division of water state department of natural resources can provide general information on groundwater availability in and around the city dekalb county indiana areas openloop systems 1 supply wells a wells used to supply openloop groundwater heat pump systems shall comply with the standards in the state board of health pws 2 bulletin as standards for construction of private water wells and water systems sections 2 and 3 compliance shall not be construed as ensuring that adequate water is available for this purpose the availability of groundwater may only be determined by a qualified well driller certified by the national well association and licensed by the state department of natural resources or a geologist certified by the state department of natural resources b if the total from all sources of supply has the capability of withdrawing more than 100000 gallons of water per day the water withdrawal facility must be registered with the state department of natural resources pursuant to ic 14257 and the city forms are available upon request 2 discharge prior approval must be obtained from the proper officials before wastewater from an openloop heat pump system may be disposed of into storm water drain stream or any other method of wastewater discharge the discharge shall not cause a public health hazard or nuisance vertical closedloop systems 1 criteria a improperly installed vertical geothermal loops may as in any other boring constitute a hazard to public health safety welfare and to the preservation of the groundwater resource the proper sealing of the boring is an important consideration in preserving the quality of the water present in the geologic formations encountered the hydrologic city of auburnordinances water chapter 53 conditions of any given area must be evaluated before the intended system is constructed properly sealed vertical loop geothermal borings should accomplish the following i prevention of groundwater contamination ii conservation of well yield and maintenance of hydrostatic head of aquifers encountered iii prevention of the intermingling of desirable and undesirable waters b the basic consideration governing the proper installation of the vertical geothermal loops is in the preservation of the geohydrologic conditions that existed before the boring was in fact drilled improperly installed the loop might be an uncontrolled point for contamination of the water located the vertical bore should be completely filled in a manner that vertical movement of water in the well bore is confined permanently to the specific zone of penetration as heretofore presented c to seal a vertical boring the original bore hole will be sealed with impermeable materials in a manner as to prevent the percolation of surface waters downward boring or along the outside of the loop leading to the water table if groundwater is encountered under confined or artesian conditions the sealing must confine the water to the aquifer in the zone it occurred thereby preventing loss of artesian pressure in the aquifer and preventing the upward circulation of water to the surface  or into formations containing no water  or to formations containing water under a lower head than that in the aquifer which is to be sealed d the entire heat exchange system shall be constructed of high density high molecular polyethylene pipe all joints must be thermally fused e each drilling contractor is required to keep and maintain accurate records for each closed loop installed the record must contain at least the following information i the location of the boring with reference to at least two permanent landmarks such as buildings and the like ii the depth and diameter of the boring iii the character and thickness of materials or formation drilled iv description of piping materials used v installation and bore hole sealing techniques used f these records shall be submitted to the city and to the state department of natural resources on a form provided by the department offices g there shall be at least 50 feet of separation between vertical closedloop excavations and a water supply well exceptions may be made if it can be demonstrated that it will have no adverse effect on public health in addition all borings shall satisfy the separation distances from points of contamination by local and state statutes as referenced in  all borings shall be made by a well driller licensed by the state department of natural resources and by the national water well association 2 installation procedures all borings shall be filled with cement grout containing no less than 6% bentonite mixed into the grout or a thick bentonite grout 112 lbs #8 mesh bentonite mixed with one gallon of water placed from the base of the boring upward by pump or other acceptable method procedures drilling fluid can be used if it is brought up to the required slurry viscosity and strength it is advised that the end loop terminate approximately 25 feet above the base of the boring to ensure adequate separation between the end of the loop and base of the boring to ensure adequate lateral protection between the loop pipes and surrounding material the bore diameter should be a minimum of two inches larger than the combined diameter of the loop pipes sand gravel slag and crushed limestone shall not be used in filling a hole city of auburnordinances water chapter 53 horizontal closedloop systems horizontal closedloop systems shall not be installed under sewage system or absorption field trenches and must also satisfy the minimum well distances from any sources of contamination as set forth in  general closedloop considerations 1 the earth in the vicinity of the bore holes should be graded to cause runoff water to drain away to prevent pooling in the immediate surrounding area of the bore holes 2 the antifreeze solution used in the closedloop system shall be a nontoxic chemical which will not in any way contaminate the potable water of the prevailing aquifer if the loop pipe has a leak a tag identifying the type of chemical and the concentration in which the system is filled shall be attached to the system in a conspicuous place a sampling faucet shall be installed as set forth in  3 antifreeze solutions or additives within the closedloop must be

statutory authorization the indiana legislature has in indiana granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions therefore the common council of the city of auburn does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city of auburn are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated inadequately floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction 3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters 4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 6 make federal flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program d objectives the objectives of this ordinance are 1 to protect human life and health 2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects 3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public 4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions 5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  streets  and bridges located in floodplains 6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas appendix appendix b flood hazard areas flood hazard areas b b3 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable application a zone portions of the special flood hazard area in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall snowmelt or a combination of both in a zones floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly but waves are usually not a significant threat to buildings these areas are labeled as zone a zone ae zones a1a30 zone ao zone ah zone ar and zone a99 on a flood insurance rate map or flood hazard boundary map the definitions are presented below zone a areas subject to inundation by

detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone zone ah areas subject to inundation by onepercent 1% annual chance shallow flooding usually areas of ponding where average depths are between one 1 and three 3 feet average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone zone ar areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection zone a99 areas subject to inundation by the onepercent 1% annual chance flood event but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an underconstruction federal flood protection system these are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection system such as dikes dams and levees to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes zone a99 may only be used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion no base flood elevations or depths are shown accessory structure a structure with a floor area of 400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of

oriented businesses within the city the provisions of this subchapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this subchapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent or effect of this subchapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscenematerial findings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to council and on

california  austin texas  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  cleveland ohio  and beaumont texas  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this subchapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which create unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections city of auburnordinances 4 sexually oriented business chapter 117 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states  600 in 198 2200 in 198 4600 in 198 8555 in 1985 and 253448  8 as of  there are a significant number of reported cases of aids in the state of indiana 9 since 1981 and to the present there have been a number of persons in auburn and dekalb county indiana testing positive for the hiv antibody 10 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in the 1982 and 45200  11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases reported in 1990 12 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea can be transmitted among other ways by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where people view adult oriented films 16 the findings noted in divisions 1 15 above raise substantial governmental concerns and a substantial governmental interest  17 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns and or interests 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest and or concern in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases city of auburnordinances 5 sexually oriented business chapter 117 22 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this subchapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually or violent related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this subchapter 24 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 25 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this subchapter  definitions  adult
