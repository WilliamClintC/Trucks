state of texas has in the flood control insurance act texas water section  delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council does ordain as follows of fact    75420 a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in

city the city in implementing this plan will in effect increase the life of their existing groundwater supply and increase the treatment capacity of their wastewater treatment facility g the city has set a goal of per capita water use reduction of 5% this shall be an annual goal for the city the peak water use occurs in the summer when people are irrigating crops and watering yards and gardens an educational program shall be initiated to show how to achieve the results of irrigation without wasting the water being applied involvement the city holds regular council meetings on the third tuesday of every month at  pm these meetings are open to the public and the public is encouraged to attend and participate in the citys government process persons are encouraged to present concerns and comments to the council at these meetings to help the councilmembers in their decision making process in addition the city is a member of the canadian river municipal water authority which holds regular board meetings goals the water conservation plan outlined has the overall objective of reducing water consumption in the city service area it has the added advantage of reducing the amount of wastewater needing treatment and disposal although regional planning for the water supply is an important aspect of water conservation planning it also focuses on measures that specifically reduce the amount of water used and ultimately on the amount of wastewater produced such measures will have the effect of extending the time until additional water and wastewater treatment capacity must be provided the city has set a goal of per capita water usage reduction of 5% as an annual goal conservation plan a education and information the city shall adopt a twophase education and information program the program will be a twoyear design that will emphasize the educational and informational aspects within the first year during the second year annual reminders will be given to the public school children and civic groups the city will provide water conservation materials to inform the system users of the ways to conserve water the following are methods for informing the system users 1 first year program a educational materials will be provided to all users of the system at city hall when their monthly water bill is paid in addition the city will have one 1 mail out of material during the first year program the mail out will be a fact sheet about the adoption of the water conservation plan    371420 b newspaper releases shall be published in the local newspaper of general circulation in the city as part of the first year plan two 2 news releases each year shall be published to inform the public of the water conservation plan in the city if emergency conditions occur andor supply problems are encountered these news releases shall be published immediately and the public will be informed of the situation c other water conservation activities such as water education programs in the school will be promoted by the city in addition the city will provide speakers information handouts and other materials as needed to promote the water conservation within the city and surrounding area tips for water conservation shall be printed on the monthly water bills at least two 2 times per year d all new connections shall be provided with information on water conservation methods and water saving devices for the home e contracts with other political subdivisions i should the opportunity ever present itself for the city to provide water under contractual agreement to another political subdivision the accepting subdivision shall adopt this water conservation plan prior to receiving any water otherwise the accepting political subdivision shall already have in effect a plan of their own that has been approved by the state water development board ii the city shall include similar provisions for any existing contracts in effect at the time of the writing and for acceptance of this plan currently the city has no contracts with other political subdivisions f water conservation literature information concerning water conservation literature is available from the state water development board included in the literature are subject areas of agricultural and municipal conservation as well as state water resources and planning literature and audiovisual materials this preprinted information will be the basis for public education and is available from the following agency texas water development board po box 132 capitol station austin texas 787113231 2 second and subsequent years activities  longterm public information a during the second and subsequent years the city shall include information on the customers utility bill reminding the users of the need for conserving water at least three 3 times per year during the year the city shall have available to all metered customers information informing them of the status of the water conservation activities and the current status of the efforts exhibited by the users for the most previous past six 6 months b water conservation material shall be made available to schools secondary and elementary for the children to take home public speakers shall be made available to various organizations to promote water conservation c as previously stated newspaper articles shall appear at least twice per year informing the public of the water conservation plan in the city b plumbing codes the city has adopted a plumbing code which has several provisions pertaining to water conservation this code is strictly enforced by the inspection and water department    372420 c retrofit program customers in existing buildings which do not have water saving devices should be encouraged to replace their old plumbing fixtures the informational material provided to them will help acquaint them with the types of devices and the advantages of installing them in their buildings the city will encourage local plumbing suppliers to stock water saving devices for new and retrofit installations d water rate structures the city is exploring a water rate schedule that encourges water conservation practices currently the rate structure has a base rate for 1st 1000 gallons used and a step rate per thousand gallons charge for all water used over the 2nd 1000 gallons a 3rd step rate charge per thousand gallons is calculated for all water used after 3000 gallons the rate structure shall be adjusted as the requirements for operating the system and capital improvement costs increase monthly bills are prepared from meter readings in the system and the excess rate is calculated based on the amount of water metered e meters the current water system meters approximately 100% of the water used operations personnel are equipped to test all meters that appear to be excessively high or low based on the previous months readings incorporated into the water conservation plan is a casebycase meter testing system f water conservation landscaping in order to reduce the demands placed on the water system by landscape and garden watering the city information and education program will encourage customers and local landscaping companies to utilize water saving practices during installation of landscaping and gardens for residential and commercial institutions g leak detection and repair the current system has a leak detection program which will be maintained the program includes the following 1 monthly water use is recorded and previous months are compared to the existing readings to confirm excessively high increases or decreases from the previous month 2 monitoring of elevated tanks and ground storage tanks which would indicate a major break in the distribution system 3 visual inspection of wells ground storage tanks and water meters by operations personnel to watch for situations that would indicate leaks in the system 4 an adequate maintenance staff available for repair of leaks h recycling and reuse the city currently reuses their wastewater as irrigation water on agricultural land adjacent to the wastewater treatment plant with the construction of our new activated sludge treatment plant the city will now have the option of irrigating public parks and golf courses with the treated effluent enforcement the water conservation plan will be enforced by the following methods 1 service taps will not be allowed for customers who do not meet the requirements of the water conservation plumbing fixtures an inspector for the city will be responsible for verifying that the new customer complies with the plumbing ordinance 2 the informational material provided to customers will show the cost saving advantages to those who retrofit their buildings with water saving fixture 3 the city inspector will not approve new construction unless it has met the proposed plumbing code 4 the water and wastewater superintendent shall assume the role of inspector and the city inspector shall be in charge of enforcement of the plan    373420 plan monitoring consumption data and status of water conservation will be reviewed annually information suggestions suggestion on ways to save water which may be included in public information are listed below 1 bathroom a take a shower instead of filling the tub and taking a bath showers usually use less water than tub baths b install a lowflow showerhead which restricts the quantity of flow at 60 psi to no more than 30 gallons per minute c do not use hot water when cold will do water and energy can be saved by washing hands with soap and cold water  hot water should only be added when hands are especially dirty d reduce the level of the water being used in a bathtub by one or two inches if a shower is not available e turn water off when brushing teeth until it is time to rinse f do not let the water run when washing hands instead scrub and then turn back on again to rinse a cutoff valve may also be installed on the faucet g shampoo hair in the shower shampooing in the shower takes only a little more water than is used to shampoo hair during a bath and much less than shampooing and bathing separately h hold hot water in the basin when shaving instead of letting the faucet continue to run i test toilets for leaks to test for a leak a few drops of food coloring can be added to the water in the tank the toilet should not be flushed the customer can then watch to see if the coloring appears in the bowl within a few minutes if it does the fixture needs adjustment or repair j use a toilet tank displacement device a onegallon plastic milk bottle can be filled with stones or with water recapped and placed in the toilet tank this will reduce the amount of water in the tank but still provides enough for flushing bricks which some people use for this purpose are not recommended since they crumble eventually and could damage the working mechanism necessitating a call to the plumber displacement devices should never be used with new lowvolume flush toilets install a new lowvolume flush toilet that uses 35 gallons or less per flush when building a new home or remodeling a bathroom k install faucet aerators to reduce water consumption l never use the toilet to dispose of cleansing tissues cigarette butts or other trash this can waste a great deal of water and also places an unnecessary load on sewage treatment plant or septic tank 2 kitchen    374420 a use a pan of water or place a stopper in the sink for rinsing pots and pans and cooking implements when cooking rather than turning on the water faucet each time a rinse is needed b never run the dishwasher without a full load in addition to saving water expensive detergent will last longer and a significant energy saving will appear on the utility bill c use the sink disposal sparingly and never use it for just a few scraps d keep a container of drinking water in the refrigerator running water from the tap until it is cool is wasteful better still both water and energy can be saved by keeping cold water in a picnic jug on a kitchen counter to avoid opening the refrigerator door frequently e use a small pan of cold water when cleaning vegetables rather than letting the faucet run f use only a little water in the pot and put a lid on it for cooking most food not only does this method save water but food is more nutritious since vitamins and minerals are not poured down the drain with the extra cooking water g use a pan of water for rinsing when handwashing dishes rather than running a faucet h always keep water conservation in mind and think of other ways to save in the kitchen small kitchen savings from not making too much coffee or letting ice cubes melt in a sink can add up in a years time 3 laundry a wash only a full load when using an automatic washing machine 32 to 59 gallons are required per load b use the lowest water level setting on the washing machine for light loads whenever possible c use cold water as often as possible to save energy and to conserve the hot water for uses which cold water cannot serve this is also better for clothing made of todays synthetic fabrics 4 for appliances and plumbing a check water requirements of various models and brands when considering purchasing any new appliance that uses water some use less water than others b check all water line connections and faucets for leaks if the cost of water is $100 per 1000 gallons one could be paying a large bill for water that simply goes down the drain because of leakage a slow drip can waste as much as 170 gallons of water each day or 5000 gallons per month and can add as much as $1500 per month to the water bill c learn to replace faucet washers so that drips can be corrected promptly it is easy to do costs very little and can represent a substantial amount saved in plumbing and water bills d check for water leakage that the customer may be entirely unaware of such as a leak between the water meter and the house to check all indoor and outdoor faucets should be turned off and the water meter should be checked if it continues to run or turn a leak probably exists and needs to be located e insulate all hot water pipes to avoid the delays and wasted water experienced while waiting for the water to run hot    375420 f be sure the hot water heater thermostat is not set too high extremely hot settings waste water and energy because the water often has to be cooled with cold water before it can be used g use a moisture meter to determine when house plants need water more plants die from overwatering than from being on the dry side 5 outofdoor use a water lawns early in the morning during the hotter summer months much of the water used on the lawn can simply evaporate between the sprinkler and the grass b use a sprinkler that produces large drops of water rather than a fine mist to avoid evaporation c turn soaker hoses so the holes are on the bottom to avoid evaporation d water slowly for better absorption and never water in high winds e forget about watering the streets or walks or driveways they will never grow a thing f condition the soil with compost before planting grass or flower beds so that water will soak in rather than run off g fertilize lawns at least twice a year for root stimulation grass with a good root system makes better use of less water h learn to know when grass needs watering if it has turned a dull graygreen or if footprints remain visible it is time to water i do not water too frequently too much water can overload the soil so that air cannot get to the roots and can encourage plant diseases j do not overwater soil can absorb only so much moisture and the rest simply runs off a timer will help and either a kitchen timer or an alarm clock will do an inch and onehalf of water applied once a week will keep most texas grasses alive and healthy k operate automatic sprinkler systems only when the demand on the towns water supply is lowest set the system to operate between four and six am l do not scalp lawns when mowing during hot weather taller grass holds moisture better rather grass should be cut fairly often so that only 12 to 34 inch is trimmed off a better looking lawn will result m use water can or hand water with the hose in small areas of the lawn that need more frequent watering those near walks or driveways or in especially hot sunny spots n learn what types of grass shrubbery and plants do best in the area and in which parts of the lawn and then plant accordingly if one has a heavily shaded yard no amount of water will make roses bloom in west texas attractive arrangements of plants that are adapted to arid or semiarid climates should be chosen o consider decorating areas of the lawn with rocks gravel wood chips or other materials now available that require no water at all p do not sweep walks and driveways with the hose use a broom or rake instead    376420 q use a bucket of soapy water and use the hose only for rinsing when washing the car utility profile the utility profile and other documentation pertaining to the water conservation plan shall be kept on file in the office of the city secretary  article 1305 crossconnection control a the city has the responsibility to supply potable water to its customers in the exercise of this responsibility the
