ii stormwater regulations that mandate local enforcement mechanisms be enacted to comply with those requirements three areas are specified for local control athe control of erosion and sediment at construction sites is required during the construction process soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers ditches sinkholes and drywells streets and roads with sediment deposits are slick and hazardous to the public in addition clearing and grading during construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat therefore this chapter will establish procedures to address stormwater control at land disturbance and construction sites bsecond a prohibition of nonstormwater discharges to the storm drainage system is required this chapter will establish procedures to regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 from stormwater discharges by any user prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the ms4 and establish legal authority to carry out all inspection surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter cfinally land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants which can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites therefore

are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 2it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate bdesignation of variance and appeal board the city council of campbellsville shall establish an appeal board consisting of the board of zoning adjustments cduties of variance and appeal board 1the appeal board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter and

owners of the property  4importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility  5necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront in the case of functionally dependent

velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and 11costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water systems streets and bridges econditions for variances upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter 1variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 2variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter 3variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard in the instance of an historical structure a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure 4variances shall only be issued upon aa showing of good and sufficient cause  ba determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant as defined in this chapter  and ca determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height additional threats to public safety cause extraordinary public expense create nuisance as defined in  15205 under public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization of the public as defined in  15205 or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 5any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation 6the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency fema and the federal insurance administration fia upon request 7variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of division d1 11 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance fvariance notification any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage  2such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the campbellsville recorder

one or more of the following conditions exist 1it is found that the increase in water flow will in no way be injurious or detrimental to the downstream property owners water courses andor sinkhole basins  2the developer has the expressed written and legal consent from the ultimate downstream property owner who will receive the discharge to channel the total storm water flow onto their property the flow shall be contained in a recorded drainage easement  andor 3the increase in storm water will not significantly impact or adversely affect the downstream receivers 7drainage easements and

the flow of water and thereby unduly increase flood heights hmarginal access streets where the proposed subdivision abuts upon or contains an existing or proposed arterial street or highway on which

subdivision regulations the planting of street trees is considered a duty of the subdivider as well as good land use practice street trees protect against excessive heat and glare and they also enhance the attractiveness and value of abutting property bit is recommended that street trees be planted inside the property lines where they will be less subject to injury where chances of motor accidents will be decreased and where they will enjoy more favorable conditions for growth if trees are to be planted within a planting strip in the street rightofway their proposed locations and the
