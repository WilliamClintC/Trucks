determine the compliance status of the user b the city may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user this authorization is subject to the following conditions 1 the waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater 2 the monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit but in no case longer than five years the user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit 3 in making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facilitys process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes 4 the request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with section 10226 and include the certification statement in accordance with subsection 10246c 5 nondetectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the epa approved method from 40 cfr with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was

its request for the waiver must be maintained by the city for three years after expiration of the waiver 7 upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the users permit by the city the industrial user must certify on each report with the statement in subsection 10246c that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its waste stream due to activities of the industrial user 8 in the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the users operations the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements of subsection 10255a or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the city and notify the city 9 this provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements

standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with subsections 1021075 and 6 and rule 624 fac 2 when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users 3 when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the director shall impose an alternate limit by using the combined waste stream formula in accordance with rule 626 fac 4 categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with the section and rule 62 fac a application categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this chapter any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the control authority b upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the following requirements are met 1 either i the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n parts 405 specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or ii the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters 2 credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease shall not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the industrial users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere 3 credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standard up to a maximum value equal to the influent value if sufficient data does not exist additional monitoring shall be required to determine eligibility for credit and compliance with pretreatment standards adjusted under this rule 4 credit shall be granted only if the industrial user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the wwf discharges if the control authority desires to waive this requirement the control authority shall submit a written request to the department for approval the department will grant approval for the waiver if the control authority provides technical documentation that no environmental degradation will result in the receiving waterbody 5 when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the control authority convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the director the control authority may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsections 5a1 5a5 below a to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must 1 employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  2 currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  3 provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  4 not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and 5 have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits b an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must 1 maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  2 continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  3 continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the director whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection 5a3 of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the superintendent will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 4 continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection 5a1 of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit c when developing equivalent mass limits the director 1 will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  2 upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 3 may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to section 102111 the industrial user must also be in compliance with subsection 102111b regarding the prohibition of bypass 6 once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section 102107 in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived 7 many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or fourday average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation 8 any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the director within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the director of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were

shall be based on a concentration converted to pounds of 300 mgl for bod 300 mgl for total suspended solids and 40 mgl for total nitrogen 2 for customers connected to the wwf prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article was derived the baseline strength shall be the highest value expressed in pounds determined by a sixmonth rolling average of equivalent daily flow of wastewater and of each of the constituents strengths utilizing the previous 12 months of monitored experience if previous monitoring has not been performed 12 months monitoring experience will be obtained to compute the six months rolling average l the highstrength wastewater impact charge shall be $30000 per pound of bod $7000 per pound of suspended solids and $45600 per pound of total nitrogen above the baseline strengths determined in subsection k of this section future fee schedules for the highstrength wastewater impact charges shall be established by resolution of the city commission which resolution may be amended from time to time m wastewater flow impact fees paid for trucked waste would be transferred with the relocation of the company if the company were to relocate to a facility

transferable n in the event a company cites the city wastewater system in its emergency operations plan for disposal of trucked waste in times of emergencies no wastewater flow impact fees will be initially assessed they will be tabled until the time of actual disposal at that time the city will make a determination regarding the assessment of flow impact fees based upon the amount of loadings

general form of the desired built environment and are referred to herein as context districts or contexts contexts may be assigned to perpetuate the existing character or pattern of development of an area or to encourage change to a more desirable character or pattern of development a primary distinction is made between areas that are urban in character and those that are suburban in character urban contexts generally exhibit a more finegrained built environment with higher densities a more wellconnected street pattern smaller blocks smaller parcels and shorter setbacks relative to suburban contexts the urban and suburban areas are classified into neighborhoods centers corridors and special purpose contexts there is also one preservation conservation recreation context the contexts are further classified into context subdistricts according to the underlying zoning districts to account for development patterns that were established when the zoning districts governed physical development under previous codes 1 context districts enumerated the city of lakeland is divided into the following context districts and context subdistricts for the purpose of regulating urban form

form that is compatible with the context these standards are intended to supplement the development standards set forth in general applicability a except as otherwise provided in this no building structure or land located within the city shall hereafter be developed except in conformity with the standards and requirements of this article determinations regarding applicability shall be made by the director of community development b nonconforming sites lawfully existing as of the effective date of this except as otherwise specifically provided herein existing development that does not conform to the standards and requirements of this article shall conform in full or where site constraints exist shall conform to the greatest practical extent upon a expansions of principal buildings which exceed 50 percent of the existing square footage of the building or buildings in the case of a multibuilding complex or b building alterations if the aggregate cost exceeds 50 percent of the assessed value of the structure or structures 2 except as otherwise specifically provided herein where an improvement or alteration is proposed to a portion of an existing nonconforming development site the standards and requirements of this article shall apply only to that portion of the site example 1 if only a section of a nonconforming fence is replaced only that section of the fence must meet the standards and requirements for fences example 2 if only a portion of a nonconforming parking lot is repaved only that portion must meet the standards and requirements for vehicle use areas general site development standards city of lakeland land development 2 3 except as otherwise specifically provided herein where an improvement or alteration is proposed to an existing development site that eliminates constraints or impediments that had prevented conformity with one or more of the standards and requirements of this article the standards and requirements thus enabled shall henceforth conform to the greatest practical extent example if a new conforming access point eliminates the need for a nonconforming access point the nonconforming access point shall be removed c each section of this article contains further applicability provisions which are specific to that set of standards and requirements d if any provision of this article is found to be in conflict with the development standards set forth in the adopted design guidelines for a historic district the conditions of an special public interest district the conditions of a planned unit development or the conditions of a conditional use the more restrictive shall prevail    42 access management  intent and applicability 1 intent the intent of this section is to provide and manage access to properties while preserving the operating efficiency of the roadway system to improve the safety of motorists and nonmotorists reduce traffic congestion and delay associated with poor access location and design to coordinate
