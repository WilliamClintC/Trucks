their own open space for recreation areas and facilities it mayhave the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreational services depending on the size of the development a portion of the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may at the option of the village board be provided in the form of private open space in lieu of dedicated public open space the extent of the credit shall be determined by the village board based upon the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the general area and upon the

quality of improvement and in the installation of recreational facilities including equipment by the developer as part of hisher obligation detailed plans of such areas including specifications of facilities to be installed must be approved by the village and the park district before any credit is given for private recreation areas the subdivider or developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents when an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted it will be necessary to compute the total parkland dedication that would have been required from the subdivision or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to be given b criteria for requiring school site
