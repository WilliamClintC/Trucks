official agency board commission committee council department or public body corporate and politic created by constitution law ordinance rule or order  or a formally constituted subunit of the foregoing any court of law or any other person or entity so designated by 1 wis stats b custodian that officer department head or employee of the city designated under otherwise responsible by law to keep and preserve any city records or file deposit or keep such records in his or her office or is lawfully in possession or entitled to possession of such public records and who is required by this respond to requests for access to such records c record any material on which written drawn printed spoken visual or electromagnetic information is recorded or preserved regardless of physical form or characteristics which has been created or is being kept by an authority record includes but is not limited to handwritten typed or printed pages maps charts photographs films recordings tapes including computer tapes and computer printouts record does not include drafts notes preliminary computations and like materials prepared for the originators personal use or prepared by the originator in the name of a person for whom the originator is working  materials which are purely the personal property of the custodian and have no relation to his or her office  materials to which access is limited by copyright patent or bequest  and published materials in the possession of an authority other than a public library which are available for sale or which are available for inspection at a public library  declaration of policy a a representative government is dependent on upon an informed electorate and therefore it is the policy of the city of onalaska that all persons are entitled to the greatest possible information regarding the affairs of their government and the official acts of those officers and employees who represent them further providing persons with such information is an essential function of government and an integral part of the routine duties of officers and employees whose responsibility it is to provide such information to that end this ordinance shall be construed in every instance with a presumption of complete public access consistent with the conduct of governmental business the denial of public access generally is contrary to the public interest and only in exceptional cases may access be denied therefore the city of onalaska adopts and incorporates as though fully set forth herein the provisions of wisconsin public records laws secs 1931 wis stats the provisions of this intended to supplement not to replace or supplant the wisconsin public records laws  records custodians a custodians the city clerk is the legal custodian of the records of the common council as a body politic and for all common council boards committees and commissions each alderperson shall be the custodian of their individual official records such as their correspondence memorandums and email any alderperson may designate in writing the city clerk to act as the official custodian of the alderpersons individual official records for every department the department head is the custodian of records for their department or agency every custodian of records shall designate in writing one 1 or more employees to act in their absences as an alternate custodian of such records b duties of custodians custodians are vested with the full legal power to render decisions and carry out the duties of the city under this custodian shall establish procedures for handling records and shall see that all of their employees entrusted with records are informed of these procedures prior to providing access to or a copy of any records the custodian shall review the records to determine that the records are responsive to the requests whether any redactions are required or whether access should be denied as to any record if a custodian has any question about granting or denying a request to inspect or copy any record they shall consult with the city attorney c public records training each custodian and alternate custodian shall receive training regarding public records laws as soon as practicable upon receiving these duties custodians and alternate custodians are personally responsible for keeping current with any developments or advancements in records keeping and the wisconsin public records laws  public access to records a form of request the wisconsin public records law dictates that certain actions must be taken with regards to oral requests for records and that certain more formal actions are taken in response to written requests for records however the state law does not expressly state how to respond to the following methods of communication therefore requests made by the following means shall be responded to as follows 1 email a request made by email may be responded to via email or in writing and shall have all of the formalities as though the request was made in writing 2 voicemail a request made by voicemail shall be responded to as though it were made orally 3 instant messagingtext messaging a request made in either such manner shall be treated as an oral request b treatment of certain data as records the wisconsin public records law provides little or no guidance as to whether the raw and perishable data of the following technologies qualify as records that must be maintained therefore the onalaska common council determines the following status of these technologies 1 email the data in an email message may constitute a public record and is subject to maintenance as a public record the data in an email is subject to the same analysis under the public records statutes as an equivalent paper or hard copy record the information technology department is responsible for ensuring that all emails are properly preserved for such analysis 2 voicemail a voicemail message is not a public record and voicemail messages do not have to be maintained as public records these messages are the functional equivalent of phone conversations phone conversations clearly are not public records additionally these messages also share many of the attributes of personal notes which are not public records either finally these messages cannot be indexed or maintained in any manner that would allow for their easy classification searching or retrieval 3 instant messaging imtext messaging tm except as set forth in this paragraph and in subparagraph b9 and 10 hereof the data involved in imtm communications is not subject to maintenance as a public record imtm has all of the attributes of instantaneous exchange of ideas as does a regular telephone conversation furthermore the data exchange has the same technological issues as to capturing and storage of data that is present with regards to voicemail with an additional concern  the raw data is often only briefly stored or not stored at all by the third party vendors or hosts that provide these services thus this technology is even closer to a true telephone conversation than are voicemails therefore city employees and officials shall refrain from using such services for official communications purposes or for matters that would result in a public record if another format such as email or written communications were employed unless the employee or official preserves a copy of such communications by either copying them to their email account downloading the communications to their city computer making a computer file of the communications or by printing and retaining a copy of such communications 4 voice over the internet protocol voip the city does not monitor nor record the data associated with the conversations that occur over voip such conversations are the very same real time voice communications as standard telephone conversations that are not public records the only difference between these communications is the medium employed in transmitting the voice communications from one 1 participant in the conversation to all others involved in the conversation 5 audio video data transmissions & communications although audio video data and radio transmissions and communications may be processed computers the city does not routinely copy the data nor maintain records of such communications whenever the city copies records or maintains copies or recordings of such communications or transmissions those copies may constitute public records that are subject to records requests and which must be maintained according to the appropriate records retention schedule the la crosse county 911 dispatch center is the custodian for police and fire radio communications 6 photoaudiovideo recordings unless otherwise provided herein are public records subject to requests and must be maintained according to the retention schedules published herein a rewritable recording systems those systems where the recordings are routinely overwritten by newer recordings such as in continuous loop videotape or digital video written to a cameras hard drive or memory such data does not constitute a record unless it is further downloaded printed or separately preserved to memorialize some event or proceeding until such time as these recordings are downloaded printed or separately preserved these recordings do not have to be preserved and as the recording equipment programsprotocols may dictate can be overwritten erased or otherwise destroyed however if such data is downloaded printed or separately preserved it shall be treated as a record and shall be retained in accordance with the retention schedules b recordings made for the purpose of preparing minutes of meetings in accordance with 7 wis stats any tape recording of a meeting as defined in 2 wis stats by any city body as defined by 1 wis stats to include each city board commission and committee may be destroyed overwritten or recorded over no sooner than ninety 90 days after the minutes have been approved and published if the purpose of the recording was to take minutes of the meeting 7 electronic document files where records as that term is defined in 2 wis stats exist in an electronic format only such electronic records shall be maintained according to the appropriate retention schedule where both hard copy ie paper and electronic copies of a record exist they shall each be subject to public records requests however when the custodian has designated pursuant to subparagraph 9 electronic records as the official records only the electronic copy shall be retained and made available for inspection under the public records laws where the custodian has not made such a designation only the hard copy shall be subject to inspection as a public record and the electronic copies shall be treated and disposed of as draft documents that do not need to be maintained beyond creation of the final hard copy 8

division 1 general provisions  authority statement of findings and purpose a authority this adopted by the city common council under the authority granted by wis stats this all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted under wis stats that relate to storm water management regulations except as otherwise specified in 23 wis stats applies to this to any amendments thereof the provisions of this deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the same governing body the city common council hereby designates the city engineer to administer and enforce the provisions of this requirements of this not preempt more stringent storm water management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following 1 wisconsin department of natural resources administrative rules permits or approvals including those authorized under 33 wis stats 2 targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the wisconsin department of natural resources under nr  wis adm statement of findings the city common council finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature 2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants 3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads 4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading 5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities 6 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes 7 undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding c purpose the general purpose of this to establish longterm postconstruction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health safety welfare and the aquatic environment specific purposes are to 1 further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions 2 prevent and control the adverse effects of storm water  prevent and control soil erosion  prevent and control water pollution  protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  control building sites placement of structures and land uses  preserve ground cover and scenic beauty  and promote sound economic growth 3 control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies  prevent undue channel erosion  control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter  and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property d intent it is the intent of the city common council that this postconstruction storm water discharges to waters of the state this be applied on a sitebysite basis the city common council recognizes however that the preferred method of achieving the storm water performance standards set forth in this ordinance is preparation and implementation of comprehensive systemslevel storm water management plans that cover hydrologic units such as watersheds on a municipal and regional scale such plans may prescribe regional storm water devices practices or systems any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under wis stats for regional storm water management measures and have been approved by the city common council it is the intent of this ordinance that the approved plan be used to identify postconstruction management measures acceptable for the community e applicability 1 where not otherwise limited by law this ordinance applies after final stabilization to a site of land disturbing construction activity that results in one or more acres of land disturbing construction activities 2 a site that meets any of the criteria in this paragraph is exempt from the requirements of this ordinance a a redevelopment postconstruction site with no increase in exposed parking lots or roads b a postconstruction site with less than 10% connected imperviousness based on complete development of the postconstruction site provided the cumulative area of all parking lots and rooftops is less than one acre c nonpoint discharges from agricultural facilities and practices d nonpoint discharges from silviculture activities e routine maintenance for project sites under five 5 acres of land disturbance if performed to maintain the original line and grade hydraulic capacity or original purpose of the facility f underground utility construction such as water sewer and fiber optic lines this exemption does not apply to the construction of any above ground structures associated with utility construction 3 notwithstanding the applicability requirements in paragraph a this to postconstruction sites of any size that in the opinion of the city engineer is likely to result in runoff that exceeds the safe capacity of the existing drainage facilities or receiving body of water that causes undue channel erosion that increases water pollution by scouring or the transportation of particulate matter or that endangers property or public safety f jurisdiction this to post construction sites within the boundaries and
