including masturbation oral and anal sex sometimes occur at unregulated sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths rooms or cubicles for view films videos or live sexually explicit shows which acts constitute a public nuisance and pose a risk to public health spread of sexually transmitted diseases 3 the prevention of sexual contact between patrons and employees at sexually oriented businesses is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and serves to address the concerns raised in the findings contained herein 4 separating entertainers from patrons and prohibiting entertainers and patrons from engaging in sexual fondling and caressing in sexually oriented businesses would reduce the opportunity for prostitution

quality and water quantity standpoint  3 to improve the public health safety and welfare by providing for the safe and efficient capture and conveyance of stormwater runoff and the correction of stormwater problems  4 to establish a reasonable stormwater management assessment or fee based on each propertys estimated contribution of stormwater runoff to the system and the benefit derived from the use of the facilities of the system  5 to encourage and facilitate urban water resources management techniques including but not limited to the retentiondetention of stormwater runoff minimization of the need to construct storm sewers and the enhancement of the environment  and 6 to provide for the issuance of bonds to finance additions extensions and improvements to the system  72011   findings and determinations it is hereby found determined and declared as follows 1 as a means of complying with federal and statemandated goals and priorities relating to stormwater management to facilitate the implementation of a stormwater drainage master plan as required by the citys comprehensive growth management plan and to provide for the current and future needs of the city with respect to collection control and disposal of storm and other surface water within the geographical boundaries of the city the commission hereby finds it to be in the best interests of the city to combine the citys existing system and all stormwater drainage facilities relating thereto presently owned and managed by the city including but not limited to such storm sewers drains culverts retention systems detention basins drainage wells conduits and appurtenant features catch basins desilting facilities recharging basins outfall structures equipment and all appurtenances whether manmade or natural necessary useful or convenient for a unified stormwater management system 2 land use and development affecting storm and surface water should be managed regulated and controlled under the unified management of a citywide system for the purpose of among other things reducing or controlling erosion sedimentation and turbidity and other pollution of water danger and damage to life and property and to protect and encourage the use of natural and efficient manmade means to these ends 3 the establishment and operation of the system will serve a vital public purpose and promote the common interests and provide for the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city 4 those elements of the system which provide for the collection storage treatment and conveyance of stormwater are of benefit and provide value to all properties within the city 5 the benefits provided by the stormwater utility bear a logical relationship to the value use and characteristics of the property located within the stormwater utility area 6 the cost of operating and maintaining the system and the financing and refinancing of existing and future necessary repairs replacements improvements and extensions thereof should to the extent practicable be allocated in relationship to each propertys estimated contribution of stormwater runoff to the system and the benefit derived from the use of the system 7 the stormwater assessments authorized by this article provide an equitable method of funding the capital cost of stormwater improvements the customer service cost the utilitywide operating cost and the maintenance service cost by fairly and reasonably allocating such costs to benefitted property classified on the basis of the stormwater burden expected to be generated by the physical characteristics and use of such property 8 it is the intent of the commission that the stormwater management assessment or fee partially fund the stormwater utility enterprise fund for the city 9 the benefited area with respect to developed property shall be assessed a charge on the basis of the prorated amount of the impervious area developed from localized studies within the city 10 it is recognized that unimproved land also contributes stormwater runoff to the system and receives a benefit from the use of the system and therefore such lands should also be assessed a proportional charge based upon the estimated contribution of stormwater runoff to the system and the benefit derived from the use of the system 11 the stormwater assessments imposed pursuant to this article are imposed by the commission not the property appraiser or tax collector any activity of the property appraiser or tax collector under the provisions of this article shall be

findings a the city commission recognizes a constitutional right to beg panhandle solicit or offer for sale items in a peaceful and nonthreatening manner however the city commission further finds that the activity of begging panhandling soliciting or selling items significant public health welfare safety concerns and crowd control problems when such activities are conducted on or near public streets which are in use by vehicular traffic because these activities involve the process of a person requesting a donation or responding to solicitation from an occupant or operator of a vehicle which is in traffic that vehicle occupant or operator must consider the request or solicitation and if the vehicle occupant or operator decides to fulfill the request that person must reach for a wallet search for money or write a check all while that person and vehicle are located on a public street in use by vehicular traffic based on the foregoing the city commission finds that the activity of begging panhandling soliciting or selling from or to occupants or operators of vehicles located on streets in use by vehicular traffic distracts drivers from their primary duty to watch traffic and potential hazards in the road observe all traffic signals or warnings and move citys streets and intersections in a lawful and safe manner and creates a potential safety hazard and poses a substantial risk to the public particularly pedestrians and impedes the free flow of traffic on the streets within the city resulting in the delay and obstruction of the publics free flow of travel on the citys streets the city commission further finds that the safety of beggars panhandlers solicitors individuals selling items pedestrians and operators and occupants of vehicles is at significant risk when such activities occur because the nature of these activities often entails beggars panhandlers solicitors or individuals selling items by standing on traffic medians bicycle paths and public streets and right of way in use by vehicular traffic property only meant for the use and control of vehicular traffic and not begging panhandling soliciting or the sale of items b it is not the purpose and intent of this article to prohibit begging panhandling soliciting or selling items in public areas when such activities will not interfere with vehicular traffic and cause traffic safety and traffic flow concerns or when such activities will not otherwise cause any public health welfare and safety concerns c this law is timely and appropriate because current city ordinances are insufficient to address the aforementioned problems the restrictions contained herein are neither overbroad nor vague and are narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest moreover this article only restricts begging panhandling soliciting and the sale of items in certain public places while preserving ample alternative areas for the valid exercise of first amendment constitutional rights furthermore in enacting this ordinance the city commission recognizes the availability of community service and other sentencing alternatives which may be appropriate remedies for violations of this article d the law is not intended to limit any persons from exercising their constitutional right to beg panhandle or solicit funds picket protest or engage in other constitutionally protected activity or any lawful activity permitted pursuant to the florida statutes its goal is instead to provide for pedestrian safety and protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of begging panhandling or solicitation that have become an unwelcome and overwhelming presence in the city and to prohibit aggressive begging panhandling and solicitation in certain public places based upon significant governmental interests  1610   11674   3 6 1913 pedestrian safety a purpose the city commission also finds that any person who intentionally blocks the passage of another person or a vehicle which requires another person to take evasive action to avoid physical contact constitutes a threat to the public health welfare and safety of the citizenry the city commission further finds that any person who begs panhandles or solicits under circumstances where the person being solicited cannot readily escape from the undesired conduct constitutes a threat to the public health welfare and safety of the citizenry the city commission also finds that any person begging panhandling or soliciting from occupants or operators of vehicles while such vehicles are on the portion of a public street currently in use by vehicular traffic and any person begging panhandling or soliciting on traffic medians bicycle paths or publics streets when such property is in use by vehicular traffic poses a threat to public safety and prevents the free flow of traffic on public streets b definitions except where the content otherwise requires as used in this chapter 1
