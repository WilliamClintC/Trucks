division 1  generally intent planned unit developments offer enhanced flexibility to develop a site relaxation of most normal zoning district standards the use of the pud zoning also allows for a greater variety of uses internal transfers of density construction phasing and a potential for lower development costs in exchange for this enhanced flexibility the city has the expectation that the development plan will result in a significantly higher quality and more sensitive proposal than would have been the case with the use of other more standard zoning districts it will be the applicants responsibility to demonstrate that the citys expectation is to be realized as evaluated against the following criteria planned unit developments are to encourage the following 1 preservation of desirable site characteristics and open space and protection of sensitive environmental features including steep slopes mature trees creeks wetlands lakes and scenic views 2 more efficient and effective use of land open space and public facilities of land uses and assembly and development of land in larger parcels 3 high quality of design and design compatible with surrounding land uses including both existing and planned site planning landscaping and building architecture should reflect higher quality design than is found elsewhere in the community 4 sensitive development in

development within it have a major influence on environmental quality in the city and the region development within the corridor must be designed with utmost sensitivity to the environment and the development pattern must be of a quantity and quality other than what might occur in the absence of specific standards the purpose of the district is to a protect the bluff creek corridor wetlands bluffs and significant stands of mature trees use of careful site design protective covenants sensitive alignment and design of roadways and utilities incorporation of natural features landscaping techniques outlined in the citys surface water management plan and the practices delineated in the citys surface water management plan b encourage a development pattern that allows people and nature to mix spanning multiple ecosystems development in the corridor should be ecologically designed and built around natural features such as trees wetlands and bluffs significant natural features should impact development rather than development impacting significant natural features the natural qualities of the corridor should be preserved to ensure sufficient habitat area for wildlife c promote innovative development techniques such as cluster development and open space subdivisions to measurably reduce the amount of impervious cover compared to traditional development practices resulting in significant portions of a site being retained as permanent protected open space d foster the creation of a greenway connecting lake minnewashta regional park and the minnesota river valley the greenway will serve as an uninterrupted pedestrian trail bikeway system and wildlife corridor affording opportunities for recreation education physical fitness and nonmotorized transportation e encourage cost effective site development open space design practices can reduce infrastructure engineering and construction costs because of lot configurations shortened streets and reduced utility runs long term cost savings can also be realized by the city of chanhassen associated with infrastructure maintenance costs f implement the policies and recommendations found in the bluff creek
