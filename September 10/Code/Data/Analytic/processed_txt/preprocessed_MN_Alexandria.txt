process by allowing deviation from the strict district and performance standards may allow a variety within a comprehensive site design concept a mixture of land uses housing types and densities b sensitivity by departing from the strict application of required performance standards associated with traditional zoning planned unit development can maximize the development potential of land while remaining sensitive to its unique and valuable natural and scenic characteristics c efficiency the consolidation of areas for recreation and reductions in street lengths and other utilityrelated expenses d density transfer the project density may be clustered basing density on number of units per acre instead of specific lot dimensions e district integration the combination of uses which are allowed in separate zoning districts such as a mixed residential allows both densities and unit types to be varied within the pud b mixed commercial residential or institutional land use with the integration of compatible land uses within the pud f infill encourage infill within areas of the city which are characterized by existing development subd 2 permitted uses the following are permitted

dynamic displays a findings studies show that there is a correlation between dynamic displays on signs and the distraction of highway drivers distraction can lead to traffic accidents drivers can be distracted not only by a changing message but also by knowing that the sign has a changing message drivers may watch a sign waiting for the next change to occur drivers are also distracted by messages that do not tell the full story in one look people have a natural desire to see the end of the story and will continue to look at the sign in order to wait for the end additionally drivers are more distracted by special effects used to change the message such as fadeins and fadeouts finally drivers are generally more distracted by messages that are too small to be clearly seen or that contain more than a simple message time and temperature signs appear to be an exception to these concerns because the messages are short easily absorbed and become inaccurate without frequent changes despite these public safety concerns there is merit to allowing new technologies to easily update messages except as prohibited by state or federal law sign owners should have the opportunity to use these technologies with certain restrictions the restrictions are intended to minimize potential driver distraction and to minimize proliferation in residential districts where signs can adversely impact residential character local spacing requirements could interfere with the equal opportunity to use such technologies and are not included without those requirements however there is the potential for numerous dynamic displays to exist along any roadway if more than one dynamic display can be seen from a given location on a road the minimum display time becomes critical if the display time is too short a driver could be subjected to a view that appears to have constant movement this impact would obviously be compounded in a corridor with multiple signs if dynamic displays become pervasive and there are no meaningful limitations on each signs ability to change frequently drivers may be subjected to an unsafe degree of distraction and sensory overload therefore a longer display time is appropriate a constant message is typically needed on a sign so that the public can use it to identify and find an intended 102423 destination changing messages detract from this wayfinding purpose and could adversely affect driving conduct second lane changes stops or turns which could result in traffic accidents accordingly dynamic displays generally should not be allowed to occupy the entire copy and graphic area of a sign in conclusion the city finds that dynamic displays should be allowed on signs but with significant controls to minimize their proliferation and their potential threats to public safety b regulations dynamic displays on signs are allowed subject to the following conditions 1 dynamic displays are allowed only on freestanding signs for conditionally permitted uses in residential districts they are allowed on wall signs and freestanding signs in all other zoning districts 2 signs less than 200 square feet dynamic displays may occupy no more than 40% of the sign area up to a maximum of 40 square feet the remainder of the sign must not have the capability for dynamic displays only one contiguous dynamic display area is allowed on a sign face 3 signs greater than 200 square feet dynamic display may occupy up to 100% of the sign area and may change messages no more frequently than once every 20 minutes changes between messages must be achieved by instantaneous repixelization 4 flashing dynamic displays are prohibited 5 dynamic displays must be designed and equipped to freeze the device in one position if a malfunction occurs the displays must also be equipped with a means to immediately discontinue the display if it malfunctions and the sign owner must immediately stop the dynamic display when notified by the city that it is not complying with the standards of this ordinance  6 dynamic displays must comply with the brightness standards contained in subdivision 17  102424 7 dynamic displays existing on the effective date of this ordinance must comply with the operational standards listed above an existing dynamic display that does not meet the structural requirements 2 and 3 above may continue as a nonconforming use  8 audio speakers or any form of pyrotechnics are prohibited in association with the dynamic display  9 video display signs must be wall signs and may be a maximum of eight square feet 10 one dynamic display sign is allowed per parcel 11 unless permitted as on offpremise sign no dynamic sign will display messages or images of offpremise advertising 12 the images and messages displayed must be complete in themselves without continuation in content to the next image or message or to any other sign signs existing on the effective date of this ordinance that utilize this technique may continue as a nonconforming use until the sign is replaced or if feasible be reprogrammed to conform to this section c incentives offpremise signs do not need to serve the same wayfinding function as do onpremises signs further new offpremise signs are strictly limited in the city and there is no potential that they will proliferate finally offpremise signs are in themselves distracting and their removal serves public safety the city is extremely limited in its ability to cause the removal of those signs this section is intended to provide incentives for the voluntary and uncompensated removal of offpremise signs in certain settings this removal results in an overall advancement of one or more of the goals set forth in this section that should more than offset any additional burden caused by the incentives these provisions are also based on the recognition that the incentives create an opportunity to consolidate offpremise signs that would otherwise remain distributed throughout the community spacing requirements are included in this section to prevent drivers from viewing multiple enhanced off premise dynamic displays at one time 1 a person may obtain a permit for an enhanced 102425 dynamic display on one face of an offpremise sign if the following requirements are met a the applicant agrees in writing to permanently remove within 45 days after issuance of the permit at least two other faces of an outdoor advertising sign in the city that are owned or leased by the applicant each of which must satisfy the criteria of parts b d of this subsection this removal must include the complete removal of the structure supporting each sign face the applicant must agree that the city may remove the sign if the applicant does not timely do so and the application must be accompanied by a cash deposit or letter of credit acceptable to the city attorney sufficient to pay the citys costs for that removal the applicant must also agree that it is removing the sign voluntarily and that it has no right to compensation for the removed sign under any law b the city has not previously issued an enhanced dynamic display permit based on the removal of the particular faces relied upon in this permit application c each removed sign has a copy and graphic area of at least 200 square feet d if the removed sign face is one for which a state permit is required by state law the applicant must surrendered its permit to the state upon removal of the sign the sign that is the subject of the enhanced dynamic display permit cannot begin to operate until proof is provided to the city that the state permit has been surrendered 102426 e the applicant must agree in writing that no dynamic displays will ever be used on one additional offpremise sign that has a copy and graphic area of at least 200 square feet in size this agreement will be binding on the applicant and all future owners of the sign if the sign is subsequently removed or destroyed and not replaced the holder of the enhanced dynamic display permit is not required to substitute a different sign for the one that no longer exists f no enhanced dynamic offpremise sign shall be erected closer to any other such offpremise sign than 2640 feet g two or more enhanced dynamic offpremise signs may not be used to present a sequential message h if one sign face on a doublefaced offpremise sign is approved for dynamic signage the remaining of the two faces must be one of the two faces designated for removal i one of the two faces designated for removal must be within 1000 feet of a road designated as an interstate or state highway 2 if the applicant complies with the permit requirements noted above the city will issue an enhanced dynamic display permit for the designated offpremise sign this permit will allow a dynamic display to occupy 100 percent of the potential copy and graphic area and to change no more frequently than once every eight seconds the designated sign must meet all other requirements of this ordinance subd 15 brightness a all signs must meet the following brightness standards 102427 1 no sign may be brighter than is necessary for clear and adequate visibility 2 no sign may be of such

include soil stabilization practices horizontal slope grading temporary or permanent cover and construction phasing l exposed soil areas  all areas of the construction site where the vegetation trees shrubs brush grasses etc or impervious surface has been removed thus rendering the soil more prone to erosion this includes topsoil stockpile areas borrow areas and disposal areas within the construction site it does not include temporary stockpiles or surcharge areas of clean sand gravel concrete or bituminous which have less stringent protection once soil is exposed it is considered exposed soil until it meets the definition of final stabilization 124 m filter strips  a vegetated section of land designed to treat runoff as overland sheet flow their dense vegetated cover facilitates pollutant removal and infiltration n final stabilization  means that all soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and that a uniform evenly distributed eg without large

stabilization measures have been employed simply sowing grass seed is not considered final stabilization where agricultural land is involved such as when pipelines are built on crop or range land final stabilization constitutes returning the land to its preconstruction agricultural use for individual lots in residential construction by either a the homebuilder completing final stabilization as specified above or b the homebuilder establishing temporary stabilization including perimeter controls for an individual lot prior to occupation of the home by the homeowner and informing the homeowner of the need for and benefits of final stabilization homeowners typically have an incentive to put in the landscaping functionally equivalent to final stabilization as quick as possible to keep mud out of their homes and off sidewalks and driveways  or for construction projects on land used for agricultural purposes eg pipelines across crop or range land final stabilization may be accomplished by returning the disturbed land to its preconstruction agricultural use areas disturbed that were not previously used for agricultural activities such as buffer strips immediately adjacent to surface waters and drainage systems and areas which are not being returned to their preconstruction agricultural use must meet the final stabilization criteria in a or b above o hydric
