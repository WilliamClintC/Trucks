requirements  general performance criteria for stormwater management  basic stormwater management design criteria  requirements for stormwater management plan approval  construction inspection  maintenance and repair of stormwater facilities  enforcement and penalties  general provisions afindings of fact it is hereby determined that land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition  this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and  stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites therefore the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation it is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety bpurpose the purpose of this ordinance is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction this ordinance seeks to meet that purpose following objectives 1minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding siltation increases in stream temperature and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels  2minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality  3minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the predevelopment hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable  4reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution wherever possible management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety capplicability this ordinance shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan applications unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the city under the specifications of of this ordinance the ordinance also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules in addition all plans must also be reviewed by local environmental protection officials to ensure that established water quality standards will be maintained during and after development of the site and that post construction runoff levels are consistent with any local and regional watershed plans to prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff the city has developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new development sites these standards apply to any construction activity disturbing 1000 or more square feet of land the following activities may be exempt from these stormwater performance criteria 1any logging and agricultural activity which is consistent with an approved soil conservation plan or a timber management plan prepared or approved by the state as applicable  2additions or modifications to existing single family structures  3developments that do not disturb more than 1000square feet of land provided they are not part of a larger common development plan  4repairs to any stormwater treatment practice deemed necessary by the city when a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a redevelopment project as defined in of this ordinance decisions on permitting and onsite stormwater requirements shall be governed by special stormwater sizing criteria found in the current stormwater design manual this criteria is dependent on the amount of impervious area created by the redevelopment and its impact on water quality final authorization of all redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the city dcompatibility with other permit and this ordinance is not intended to interfere with abrogate or annul any other ordinance rule or regulation stature or other provision of law the requirements of this ordinance should be considered minimum requirements and where any provision of this ordinance imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance rule or regulation or other provision of law whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence eseverability if the provisions of any article section subsection paragraph subdivision or clause of this ordinance shall be judged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction such order of judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any article section subsection paragraph subdivision or clause of this ordinance fdevelopment of a stormwater design manual the city has adopted the city of portlands stormwater design manual yet may furnish additional policy criteria and information including specifications and standards for the proper implementation of the requirements of this ordinance and may provide other such information this manual will include a list of acceptable stormwater treatment practices including the specific design criteria and operation and maintenance requirements for each stormwater practice the manual may be updated and expanded from time to time at the discretion of the local review authority based on improvements in engineering science monitoring and local maintenance experience stormwater treatment practices that are designed and constructed in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards where the citys policies and

inhibiting the safe circulation and carrying capacity of the street curb cuts shall be designed to established city standards eproximity of parking to use required parking spaces for residential uses must be located on the site of the use required parking spaces for nonresidential uses must be located on the site of the use or in parking areas whose closest point is within 250 feet of the site required parking spaces  purpose the purpose of required parking spaces is to provide enough onsite parking to accommodate the majority of traffic generated by the range of uses which might locate at the site over time while at the same time maximizing land use by avoiding an oversupply of parking stalls the required parking numbers correspond to broad use categories not specific uses in response to this long term emphasis variation from parking requirements shall be allowed only after approval of a variance as per number of required spaces 1table 3501a and 1b state the required minimum and maximum number of spaces for each use category 2when computing parking spaces based on floor area areas used for parking are not counted the number of parking spaces is computed based on the primary use of the site except as stated in paragraphs 3 and 4 below 3when there are two or more separate uses on a site the required parking for the site is the sum of the required parking for the individual uses for joint use parking see paragraph 5 4when a use has more than 20 percent of its floor area in a distinct function ie office warehouse or retail the required parking is calculated separately for each function an example would be a 40000 square foot use with a 10000 square foot office area and a 30000 square foot warehouse the required parking would be computed separately for the office and warehouse functions 5joint use parking joint use of required parking spaces may occur where two or more uses on the same or separate sites are able to share the same parking spaces because their parking demands occur at different times the number of required stalls per use may be reduced up to 25% joint use of required nonresidential parking spaces is allowed if the following documentation is submitted in writing to the city administrator as part of a building permit application or land use review athe names and addresses of the uses and of the owners or tenants that are sharing the parking  bthe location and number of parking spaces that are being shared  can analysis showing that the peak parking times of the uses occur at different times and that the parking area will be large

refers to land use regulatory zones districts under the zoning the city of wood village att a  att a measurements  purpose this how measurements are made in the zoning code  fractions when calculations result in fractions the results will be rounded as follows aminimum requirements when a regulation is expressed in terms of a minimum requirement any fractional result will be rounded up to the next consecutive whole number for example if a minimum requirement of one tree for every 30 feet is applied to a 50 foot strip the result of 167 is rounded up to 2 required trees bmaximum limits when a regulation is expressed in terms of maximum limits any fractional result will be rounded down to the next lower number for example if a maximum limit of one dwelling unit for every 8000 square feet is applied to an 18000 square foot site the resulting fraction of 225 is rounded down to 2 allowed dwelling units  measuring distances adistances are measured horizontally when determining distances for setbacks and structure dimensions all distances are measured along a horizontal plane from the appropriate property line edge of building structure storage area parking area or other object these distances are not measured by following the topography of the land see figure 7301 horizontal measurement image <fig7301_horizontalmeasurementjpg>distances are always measured horizontally bmeasurements are shortest distance when measuring a required distance such as the minimum distance between a structure and a lot line the measurement is made at the shortest distance between the two objects see figure 7302 exceptions are stated in d and e7302 closest distance image <fig7302_closestdistancejpg>measurement is taken from the shortest distance between the points cmeasurements of vehicle travel areas measurements of a minimum travel distance for vehicles are measured down the center of the vehicle travel area for example curving driveways and travel lanes are measured along the arc of the driveway or traffic lane see figure 7303 measuring vehicle travel areas image <fig7303_measuringvehicletravelareaspng>measure down the middle of the travel area dmeasurements involving a structure measurements involving a structure are made to the closest wall of the structure chimneys eaves and bay windows up to 12 feet in length are not included in the measurement other items such as covered porches and entrances are included in the measurement see figure 7302 above and the base zone sections eunderground structures structures or portions of structures that are entirely underground are not included in measuring required distances see figure 7304figure 7304underground structures image <fig7304_undergroundstructurespng> measurements do not include underground structures  measuring distances on maps zone boundaries that are shown crossing lots are usually based on a topographic feature or a set measurement from a property line or topographic feature such as the top of slope middle of stream 25 feet from top of bank or 30 feet from the property line when zone boundaries are shown crossing properties with no clear indication of the basis for the line exact distances are to be determined by scaling the distances from the official zoning maps using the center of the zoning line  measuring height ameasuring building height height of buildings is generally measured as provided in the oregon structural specialty the uniform building amended by the state the height of buildings is the vertical distance above the base point described in paragraphs 1 or 2 below the base point used is the method that yields the greater height of the building for a flat roof the measurement is made to the top of the parapet or if there is no parapet to the highest point of the roof the measurement is made to the deck line of the mansard roof or to the average height of the highest gable of the pitched or hipped roof that has a roof pitch of 12 in 12 or less for pitched or hipped roofs with a pitch steeper that 12 in 12 the measurement is to the highest point for other roof shapes such as domed vaulted or pyramidal shapes the measurement is to the highest point see figure 7305 the height of a stepped or terraced building is the maximum height of any segment of the buildingfigure 7305measuring height roof types image <fig7305_measuringheightrooftypesjpg> 1base point 1 base point 1 is the elevation of the highest adjoining sidewalk or ground surface within a 5 foot distance of the exterior wall of the building when such sidewalk or ground surface is not more than 10 feet above lowest grade see figure 7306 2base point 2 base point 2 is the elevation that is 10 feet higher than the lowest grade when the sidewalk or ground surface described in paragraph 1 above is more than 10 feet above the lowest grade see figure 7306 measuring height base point 17307 measuring height base point 2 image <fig7307_basepoint12png> bmeasuring height of other structures the height of other structures such as flag poles and fences is the vertical distance from the ground level immediately under the structure to the top of a structure excluding exempted portions when chimneys and other objects are allowed to exceed the base height of the zone by a set amount that set amount is measured to the top of these objects special measurement provisions are also provided below 1measuring height of retaining walls and fences retaining walls and fences on top of retaining walls are measured from the ground level on the higher side of the retaining wall see figure 7308figure 7308measuring height retaining walls image <fig7308_measuringheightretainingwallspng> 2measuring height of decks deck height is determined by measuring from the ground to the top of the floor of the deck if there is no rail or if the rail walls are more than 50 percent open and from the ground to the top of the rails for all other situations  determining average slope aaverage slope used when calculating the slope of a lot an average slope is used based on the elevations at the corners of the lot the average slope of a lot is calculated by subtracting the average elevation of the uphill lot line and the average elevation of the downhill lot line and dividing the sum by the average distance between the two lot lines the average elevation of the uphill and downhill lot line is calculated by adding the elevations at the ends of the lot line and dividing by two see figure 7309figure 7309calculating average slope image <fig7309_calculatingaverageslopepng>  determining the area of the faade of a building the area of a specific faade of a building is determined by adding the square footage of surface area of each section of wall visible from that perspective for buildings with more than one wall along one facade for example rooms jutting out from the main building or a building where each floor is set back from the floor below all of the walls are included in the total area the total area does not include any roof area see figure 73010figure 73010faade of a building image <fig73010_buildingfacadepng>  determining the plane of a building wall the purpose of this measurement system is to provide a way to calculate varying amounts of bulk on a particular side of a structure the plane of a building wall is a plane that extends from the ground to the top of each wall of a structure a structure with more than one wall along one faade for example room jutting out from the main structure or a structure where each floor is set back from the floor below will have a different plane for each of the walls the area of the plane is determined by calculating the area of the plane from the ground to the top of the wall the plane does not include roof area in situations where there is more than one wall along one faade the bulk of the closer walls cover the bulk of walls that are further back in these situations the wall is measured by extending the plane of the wall to the area that is behind a closer wall see figure 73011 there are special measurement rules for situations where the plane of the building wall is wider than portions of the wall below see figure 73012 belowfigure 73011plane of a building wall image <fig73011_buildingwallplanepng> where the plane of the building wall contains portions that are wider than areas of the wall that are below it the calculation of area is made using the wider dimension and extending the plane to the open area below see figure 73012figure 73012additions to the plane of a building wall image <fig73012_buildingwallplaneadditionpng>  measuring lot width and depths lot widths and depths are measured from the midpoints of opposite lot lines see figures 73013 and 73013 measuring lot width73014 measuring lot depth image <fig7301314_measuringlotpng>  measuring areas with squares of specified dimensions required areas for example required outdoor areas in residential zones must be of a sufficient size and configuration so that a square measuring x by x can be placed totally within the required area the dimensions of the square are stated in the base zone and additional regulations sections see figure 73015figure 73015using squares with specified dimensions image <fig73015_specifieddimensionsquarespng>  setback averaging certain regulations allow for setbacks to be averaged in these situations the required setback may be reduced to the average of the existing setbacks of the lots that are on both sides of the site see figure 73016 the following rules apply in calculating the average athe setbacks used for the calculations must be the same type of setback that is being averaged for example only front setbacks can be used to average a front setback bonly the setbacks on the lots that abut each side of the site and are on the same street may be used setbacks across the street or along a different street may not be used cwhen an abutting lot is vacant or if the lot is a corner lot then the average is of the setback of the nonvacant lot and the required setback for the zonefigure 73016setback averaging image <fig73016_setbackaveragingpng>  local street design image <_001jpg> image <_002jpg> image <_003jpg> image <_004jpg> image <_005jpg>
