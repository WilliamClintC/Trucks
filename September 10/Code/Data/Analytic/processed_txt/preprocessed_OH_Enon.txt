planning and zoning thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention  editors note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10   this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position   enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the

constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the health safety and general welfare of its citizens therefore the council of the village of enon state of ohio does ordain as follows bfindings of fact the village of enon has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base additionally structures that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss in order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth these regulations are adopted cstatement of purpose it is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to 1protect human life and health  2minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4minimize prolonged business interruptions  5minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and minimize future flood blight areas  7ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  8minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and near flood prone areas  9ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the floodplain are maintained  10minimize the impact of development on the natural beneficial values of the
