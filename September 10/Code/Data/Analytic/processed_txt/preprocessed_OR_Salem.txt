measures in order to better meet the water quality requirements for salems urban watersheds and the willamette river erosion prevention is emphasized over sediment control these techniques are especially important on larger construction sites immediately before and during the rainy portion of the year erosion prevention techniques are designed to prevent soil particles from being dislodged by the force of water and wind these measures include such things as the timing of construction work limiting the disturbance of ground cover and protective matting sediment control measures are designed to capture soil particles after they have been dislodged and are used to retain the soil particles on a site these measures include such things as silt fences and settling basins both erosion

reviewed by the keeper and determined to be eligible preservation means the act or process of applying measures necessary to sustain the existing form integrity and materials of a historic resource work including preliminary measures to protect and stabilize the resource generally focuses on the ongoing maintenance and repair of historic materials and features rather than extensive replacement

historical cultural or architectural values restoration means the act or process of accurately depicting the form features and character of a historiccontributing resource or historicnoncontributing resource as it appeared at a particular period of time by means of the removal of features from other periods in its history and reconstruction of missing features from the restoration period the

historic districts where addition or alteration to the exterior of a historic contributing resource or noncontributing building in a historic district or construction of a new building in a historic district will occur partially inside and partially outside of the district boundaries historic design review is required for that portion of the building that is within the district and if the majority of the area of the building is inside the historic district for that portion of the building that is not within the historic district 4 relationship to other land use reviews projects that require historic design review may also require other land use reviews if other land use reviews are requirements for development such reviews shall be held prior to or concurrently with historic design review b objectives the standards in this chapter shall be construed to do the following 1 historic contributing buildings and individually listed resources historic contributing buildings and individually listed resources are valuable community resources that contribute immeasurably to the citys identity history unique sense of place and quality of life preserving these buildings and resources involves careful planning conscientious maintenance and repair knowledgeable and informed restoration and sensitive rehabilitation that accommodates modern business and residential lifestyles the standards set forth in this chapter for historic contributing buildings and individually listed resources are intended to preserve and enhance the buildings resources and districts generally while allowing for adaptive reuse rehabilitation of these buildings and resources 2 noncontributing buildings some buildings and structures in a historic district are noncontributing these buildings and structures typically do not contribute to the districts historic significance because they either date from outside the districts period of significance or their historic significance has been materially impaired by additions and alterations the standards set forth in this chapter for noncontributing buildings and structures do not require restoration to their original appearance or require imitation of the appearance of a historic contributing building or structure  rather the objectives are twofold first the objective for historic noncontributing is to return when feasible these buildings to a historic contributing state second the objective for all noncontributing buildings is to maintain the visual coherence of the historic district as a whole 3 new construction new buildings and structures will be built in historic districts these new buildings and structures should enhance rather than detract from the overall character of the district it is crucial that the existing harmony of proportions and materials be enhanced when new construction occurs therefore the objective of the standards set forth in this chapter for new construction is to ensure that the design and construction of new buildings and structures is consistent and compatible with the architectural styles of historic contributing buildings that are found in the district c classes historic
