complex would not be an accessory use even though it supports the principal use due to the potentially significant impacts of the maintenance operation 3 a contractor performing simple maintenance on

subject to site plan or subdivision review if that use meets the threshold of review articulated in the site plan regulations or the subdivision regulations h secondary uses secondary uses which are not deemed accessory uses since they are not actually supportive of a principal use which clearly would have no significant negative impacts may be treated as accessory uses at the reasonable discretion of the director of building zoning and licensing services example while gardening is an accessory use to a residence it is not accessory to a commercial use however it would be reasonable

needed  and 5 the lot meets minimum lot andor coverage requirements as provided for in dimensional regulations b special exception a nonconforming lot which does not meet all of the criteria listed above may be used for a proposed allowed use only by special exception based upon the standard criteria for special exceptions and a finding by the zba that the proposed use of the nonconforming lot is reasonable c existing buildings an existing building situated on a nonconforming lot may be expanded by right subject to other provisions of this chapter and compliance with setbacks coverage etc since the nonconforming nature of the undersized lot is not affected by the expansion a expansion in accordance with  275303 above a nonconforming structure may be expanded by right where the proposed expansion does not increase the nonconformity example if a portion of a building encroaches into the rear setback an addition could be placed in the front of the building but not within the rear

nonconforming condition is changed to a conforming condition the nonconforming condition may not be restored furthermore once a nonconforming condition is reduced it may not afterward be restored to the earlier condition of greater nonconformity b lessen nonconforming condition a property owner may by right seek to lessen a nonconforming condition in applying to do so heshe may not be compelled

any recently created lot has been subdivided from the parent tract within two years prior to the date that the application for the conservation subdivision is submitted or from the date that a

a yield plan approach the yield plan is the theoretical layout showing the lots that would reasonably be approvable and buildable under a  275333 general provisions  275334   275335 base density bonus conservation subdivisions receive a base density bonus of 30% beyond conventional subdivisions based upon yield plans or assumed in the adjusted tract acreage approach additional density enhancements beyond the base density bonus may be awarded as specified in  275336 below  275336 density bonus enhancements density enhancements beyond the base density determined above shall be awarded where the board determines that the applicant meets the intent of the requirements below each enhancement percentage shall be based upon the number of dwelling units established in the base density multiple enhancements are cumulative and shall be added to the base density except that only one additional open space enhancement shall be allowed among the three alternatives appropriate easements covenants andor deed restrictions shall be incorporated to protect the enhancements where deemed necessary by the board conventional subdivision the planning board must vote to endorse the yield plan as meeting the objective of this subsection the number of lots in the endorsed yield plan is then multiplied by 13 which is the base density bonus for a conservation subdivision b adjusted tract acreage approach the adjusted tract acreage approach is used to derive an objective and consistent measure of the total carrying capacity of the tract the method is less subjective than the yield plan approach but it is not as good an indicator of what could be built conventionally the steps are to 1 determine gross tract acreage  2 subtract the acreage of any existing road rightsofway and existing rightsofway for overhead utilities  3 subtract the acreage of very poorly drained soils ponds and streams to ordinary highwater mark and slopes of 25% or greater  4 subtract 12 the acreage of nonwetland floodplains  5 multiply by 075 allowance for new roads other infrastructure wetland buffers poorly drained soils inaccessible upland areas and typical loss of density due to platting constraints  6 divide by the minimum permitted lot size for a conventional singlefamily subdivision in the district  calculate proportionally if the tract lies in two zoning districts see table of dimensional standards in   and 7
