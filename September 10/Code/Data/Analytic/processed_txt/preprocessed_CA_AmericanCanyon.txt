variance procedure  nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  2016   2 2001  appeals to city council a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the napa county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency  2016   2 2001  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level  providing that the procedures of articles iii and iv of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in this chapter to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in  cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use  provided that the provisions of subsections a are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance g upon consideration of the factors of c and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  2016   2 2001 discharging firearms and other weapons  discharging firearms or weapons every person who except in a regularly licensed shooting gallery or shooting range

performance objectives are achieved on an aggregate basis for those work sites when the city is implementing the chapter if the employer demonstrates that the performance objectives subsection d of this section are achieved using the averaging methodology then those work sites included in the averaging are not subject to the requirements of subsection h of this section a the weighted avr average for the multiple work sites is calculated by 1 adding together the employeedays for each work site 2 adding together the vehicle tripdays for each work site then 3 dividing the aggregate employeedays by the aggregate vehicle tripdays to obtain the weighted avr average b the weighted ver average for the multiple work sites is calculated by dividing the aggregate vehicle tripdays by the aggregate employeedays c the weighted ver average for multiple work sites can also be calculated as the number of peak period employees multiplied by ver site 1 plus the number of peak period employees multiplied by ver site 2 divided by the total peak period employees sites 1 and 2 l random sample method the method described in this section must be followed when an employer chooses to use a random sample to meet the requirements of subsection k of this section 1 summary a g3 of this section provides for an option for larger work sites to calculate avr or ver based upon a random sample of the employee population the random sample option is available only for work sites where four hundred or more employees start work during the peak period six am am b the size of the random sample depends upon the number of employees who start work during the peak period at the work site the means to determine the minimum size of the random sample is described in subsection l2b of this section c the sample must be selected as described in subsection l2d of this section once the sample group has been selected the employer is not permitted to send additional survey forms to employees beyond the original sample group this will invalidate the results of the survey and void the employers option to utilize the random sample method d a high response rate is critical to ensure that the random sample produces an accurate avr or ver for the work site the employer should make a concerted effort to obtain a completed survey from each employee in the sample all nonrespondents in the sample will be treated as drive along commuters ie commuting in a single occupant vehicle for purposes of calculating the work site avr or ver 2 basic random sample selection methodology a the employer shall compile a complete list of employees at the work site in alphabetical order and assign a consecutive number to each employee the employer shall exclude from the list employees who are known to regularly start work outside the six am am peak period b the employer shall determine the number of employees to be included in the random sample using the following formula where n is the sample size and n is the number of employees who start work between six am and ten am a sample size of n based on this formula should produce an avr or ver with a sampling error of at most plus or minus 005 with ninetyfive percent probability the sample size based on this formula is displayed in the table below number of peak period employees at work site sample size 400 to 420 200 421 to 440 205 441 to 460 210 461 to 480 214 481 to 500 218 501 to 550 225 551 to 600 235 601 to 650 240 651 to 700 248 701 to 750 255 751 to 800 260 801 to 850 265 851 to 900 270 901 to 950 274 951 to 1000 278 1001 to 1500 300 1501 to 2000 320 2001 to 3000 340 3001 to 4000 350 4001 to 6000 360 6001 to 10000 370 >10001 380 c in no case can the random sample size be less than indicated in the above table the employer may choose to include a larger number of employees in the survey a larger sample group should more accurately represent the entire employee population provided that the employer obtains a high response rate d after the sample size has been determined the employer has two options for selecting the sample i use a computer program to select distinct random numbers from the employee list eg two hundred seventyeight distinct random numbers between one and one thousand where one thousand employees start working during the peak period ii select employees from the list based upon a sampling interval and random starting number to determine the sample interval the employer shall divide the total population of employees who start work during the six am am peak period by the sample size and round the result down to the nearest integer example if a work site has one thousand employees who start work during the peak period and the sample size is two hundred seventyeight then the sampling interval equals 1000 divided by 278   36 the 36 is rounded down to 3 to produce the sampling interval therefore every third name on the list shall be selected beginning at a random starting number x where x is between 1 and 3 if x equals 3 then the sample would include numbers 3 6 9 12 15 etc until the required 278 numbers have been selected e the methodology described in subsection l2d of this section will eliminate potential bias that could result from choosing survey participants on the basis of department rank income level home code or other demographic factors or from excluding certain segments of the employee population 3 selection process for subsequent surveys a in subsequent surveys the employer may select the random sample using the method described in subsection l2 of this section or the employer may choose to survey the same employees that were included in the previous random sample employees in the previous random sample group who have left the orgrni7ation shall be replaced in the new sample by employees selected per subsection l2 of this section the latter approach may enable the employer to more accurately track changes in commute mode from one survey to next b if the number of employees who start work between six am and ten am has increased or decreased by more than twenty percent since last survey the employer shall select a completely new random sample group using the methodology describe in subsection l2 of this section 4 performance objective calculation reporting and recordkeeping a avr or ver must be calculated according to the methodology describe in subsection k of this section notwithstanding the provision of subsection k4 of this section any employee in the random sample group who fails to submit a completed survey form shall be included in the performance objective calculation as a drive long commuter single occupant vehicle b the employer shall submit to the city 1 the completed survey forms for processing or the results of the survey according to the subsections g7 or g8 of this section  2 a description of the methodology used to select the random sample  and 3 a tally showing the number of surveys distributed the number completed and the number of nonrespondents c the employer shall retain records needed to document adherence to this protocol for a period of at least three years including the master list used to generate the random sample and the names and numbers selected from that list such records files and documentation shall be made available to the city during any onsite audit conducted by the city  1993 speed

park and civic facilities development impact fees traffic mitigation impact fees mobilehome park rent stabilization program note  prior ordinance history  purpose and findings a residents of mobilehome parks unlike apartment residents or residents of other rental properties are in a unique position in that prior to occupation of a mobilehome space they are required to make substantial investments in a mobilehome residence and incur the expense of placing their mobilehome on the rented mobilehome site in addition the removal or relocation of a residents mobilehome from a given space can be accomplished only at substantial costs such relocation may cause extensive damage to the mobilehome and many older mobilehomes cannot in fact be relocated to newer mobilehome parks due to permit landscaping site preparation requirements and restrictions that many newer mobilehome parks impose on renters b there is presently within the city a shortage of mobilehome spaces on which there are not currently located mobilehomes and which are therefore available for occupancy this shortage of empty spaces which currently approximates one percent of all mobilehome spaces within the city has resulted in an extreme shortage of decent safe and sanitary mobilehome housing in the city c mobilehomes constitute an important source of housing for persons of low and moderate income because of the present shortage of empty mobilehome spaces there is a low vacancy rate and rents are rapidly rising and have been for several years in mobilehome parks in the city causing concern anguish and stress to a substantial number of the mobilehome owners and residents of mobilehome parks within the city many of whom are retired persons on fixed incomes elderly persons on fixed incomes or persons with relatively low incomes d alternative sites for the relocation of mobilehomes within the city and surrounding areas are difficult to find due to the shortage of vacant spaces restrictions on the age size or style of mobilehomes permitted in many parks and requirements related to the installation of mobilehomes including permits landscaping and site preparation e the result of the conditions identified above has been the creation of a captive audience of mobilehome owners this in turn has contributed to the creation of a great imbalance in the bargaining positions of the park owners and mobilehome owners in favor of the park owners f mobilehome owners are property owners with sizable investments in their homes and appurtenances and would incur significant costs in the event of relocation g the continuing possibility of unreasonable space rental increases in mobilehome parks within the city threatens to diminish the value of the investment of the mobilehome owner in his or her mobilehome and contributes to unreasonably suppressed resale rates therefore it is desirable to provide vacancy control in the rent stabilization program h existing state law permits mobilehome park owners to require mobilehome owners to make modifications to their homes for reasons of aesthetics or conformity to park standards that amount to capital improvements which accrue to the benefit of the park owner by potentially increasing the market value of the park itself i because of the low vacancy rate it is necessary to encourage the development of mobilehome parks within the city to

entitled to maintain and increase their noi in accordance with this section the arbitrator shall make a determination of whether the park owners noi yields a fair return under this standard 2 the formula for calculating the fair noi return shall be as follows fair noi   base year noi  1 +75 % change cpi 3 except as provided in this section it shall be presumed that the noi produced by the park during the base year provided a fair return 4 calendar year 2010 shall be established as the base year for purposes of determining whether a park owners noi provides a fair return if a satisfactory

factors in evaluating a space rent increase the arbitrator should also consider the following factors in addition to any other factors the arbitrator deems relevant in order to determine whether there

physical condition of the mobilehome space or park of which it is a part including the quantity and quality of maintenance and repairs performed during the preceding twelve months or since the last rent increase in order to justify the denial or reduction of a rent increase the arbitrator must find that there are substantial maintenance problems or code violations in the mobilehome space andor park and that the owner has had adequate previous notice of these problems and a reasonable opportunity to correct them if a reduction in the proposed rent increase is justified pursuant to this section the arbitrator shall make a reasonable effort to quantify the approximate cost of the repairs or maintenance work needed or the amount of the rent increase that would be appropriate after the completion of the repairs or maintenance work in order to ensure that there is some proportionality between the reduction in the proposed rent increase and the condition of the premises f notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary no provision of this chapter shall be applied to prohibit the granting of a rent increase that is demonstrated to be necessary to provide a park

necessitated as the result of an accident disaster or other event for which the park owner received insurance or other benefits only those costs otherwise allowable and exceeding such benefits may be calculated as operating expenses expenditures for necessary capital improvements to upgrade existing facilities together with a reasonable return upon the capital improvement investment made by the park owner shall be an allowable operating expense only if the park owner has a consulted with the affected residents prior to initiating construction or implementation of the capital improvement

improvements during the base year which were not reflected in the rent levels on the base date b substantial repairs were made due to uninsured damage caused by fire natural disaster or vandalism c maintenance and repair were below accepted standards so as to cause significant deterioration in the quality of housing services or d other expenses were unreasonably high or low notwithstanding the following of prudent business practice  2 that the rent was disproportionate due to one of the enumerated factors below a the rent on the base date was exceptionally high or low due to the fact that the rent was not established in an armslength transaction or b the rent on the base date was substantially higher or lower than at other times of the year by reason of premiums being charged or rebates given for reasons unique to particular spaces b if the circumstances specified in subsection a2 of this section are demonstrated the base date rent shall be adjusted to reflect the rent that would have been received if the base date rent had been set under general market conditions in making this adjustment the arbitrator shall utilize the median rent in effect on the base date or a good

statement of purposes a at the present time there is a critically short supply of rental housing in the city and due to the extreme profitability in the current real estate market of constructing condominiums or converting existing apartment projects to condominiums stock cooperatives and to community apartment projects for sale it is anticipated that the number of applications to construct condominiums or to convert existing apartment projects into condominiums stock cooperatives and to community apartment projects will increase and will adversely impact the availability of existing rental housing and affordable housing units in the city and will result in the removal of rental housing units and affordable housing units from the market tenants who face eviction due to conversion are experiencing serious difficulties in locating comparable replacement rental housing these difficulties are particularly acute for elderly tenants and those with physical limitations particularly the handicapped and disabled in addition families with minor dependent children face greater relocation difficulties than families without such children b since the conversion of rental units to condominiums stock cooperatives and community apartment projects is a substantial cause of the rental housing and affordable housing shortage the city council finds and declares that an emergency exists requiring the emergency enactment of the ordinance codified in this chapter and it would be just and proper for the subdividers who may enjoy the benefits of such conversions to assist tenants who are displaced by the conversion activity and who otherwise would be forced to bear the burdens of displacement without any assistance  2006  definitions for purposes of this chapter the

projects to nonsenior housing projects  2009  findings a californias unruh civil rights act civil 1 et seq expressly allows private parties to establish housing for senior citizens and the federal fair housing act 42 usc et seq expressly allows for housing for older persons b state law encourages senior citizen housing developments specifically government requires cities to provide senior citizen housing developments density bonuses for development of such facilities and provide lower parking standards therefore by law senior only housing facilities may receive concessions and incentives that nonsenior facilities do not receive c on average senior citizens make less impact on the environment than do nonseniors occupancy rates for seniors are significantly less than nonsenior occupancy rates seniors make substantially fewer trips than nonseniors seniors drive fewer vehicles and therefore require fewer parking spaces per housing unit than do nonseniors this chapter acknowledges these facts when it applies a lower parking requirement for certain senior housing facilities than would have otherwise applied d because on average senior citizens occupy few persons per dwelling unit than nonsenior citizen residents seniors use substantially less water per household than nonseniors therefore if there is no discretionary process to administer changes from senior to nonsenior mobilehome parks the citys zero water footprint policy will not be applied to such land use changes this will further jeopardize the citys ability to supply water to its residents in accordance with the fee structure adopted by the city council e based on the foregoing newly created or authorized nonsenior facilities have a greater impact on the environment than do existing senior facilities therefore the city determines that all conversions as defined in this chapter are projects within the meaning of public resources  f government et seq permit all of the following developments to pay lower developer fees to schools developments which qualify as senior citizen housing multilevel facility for the elderly or as a residential care facility for the elderly and manufactured homes and mobilehomes in certain communities limited to older persons g government 1 and 655952 demonstrate that cities should often disallow these senior housing uses from converting to nonsenior housing uses until the full amount of school fees that would have otherwise been required to be paid were in fact paid h if a previously approved facility obtained concessions or incentives because it indicated that it would qualify and operate as a senior housing project but subsequently lost its qualifying status the development facility should mitigate the impacts on the community including but not limited to offsetting the concessions and incentives previously received i if the city applied reduced public park dedications for senior restricted developments or lowered fees for vehicular parking transportation andor schooling because the project originally qualified as a senior housing project and then that project later converted to nonsenior housing the public would be harmed to the extent that the converted project did not provide the full amount of mitigation that would have been otherwise required if a conversion occurs the city should require that all impacts from the conversion are mitigated  2009  definitions the following terms shall have the following meanings for the purposes of this chapter a concessions or incentives mean any concession or incentive issued or awarded to a project by the city by virtue of the project qualifying as a senior housing project concessions and incentives shall include but are not limited to 1 utilization of the lesser parking standards described in municipal 21 or similar ordinance  2 receipt of a density bonus incentive or lower parking requirements consistent with government b3  3 any preference received on account of qualifying as housing for older persons under federal law having been designed to meet the physical and social needs of senior citizens under state law or qualifying as a senior citizen housing development as defined under civil 3 or 5111 or similar authority  4 any development which received any benefit pursuant to et seq relating to lowered developer fees to fund school construction  or 5 any other reduction in design or development standards financial assistance or other development related concession or incentive that the project received from the city on account of the project intending to become or for actually becoming a senior housing project b convert or conversion means changing from existing senior housing or a senior housing project to a housing project that could not qualify as a senior housing project c director shall mean the city of american canyon director of community development d senior citizen shall mean any individual who is

 2009  duty to obtain conversion permit no senior housing project shall convert to a nonsenior housing project unless the project first obtains a conversion permit pursuant to this chapter and

complete applications for conversion permits the planning commission shall issue a conversion permit if it makes findings consistent with the following a the proposed use of the property as something other than a senior housing project is in accord with the objectives of this chapter and the purposes of the zone in which the project site is located b the new use and operation is consistent with the general plan c the project will comply with all parking requirements of municipal 21 which apply to nonsenior facilities if the city however in its sole and reasonable discretion determines that requiring parking spaces pursuant to this subsection would be detrimental to the public welfare the applicant shall instead provide reasonable alternative parking accommodations as part of the citys determination of whether the public welfare would be harmed the city shall consider the ability of the applicant to provide additional parking without unreasonably degrading the appearance of the real
