mixeduse zoning districts are primarily intended to create maintain and promote a variety of vertically and horizontally mixeduse places and to maintain and promote the desired physical character of existing and developing mixeduse places the various mx districts are differentiated on the basis of allowed building types and a mix of allowable uses in each building 1 to guide the development of a mix of uses to further the future of the train station area commercial corridors and main street nodes in the village 2 to support the desired character of the village as expressed in adopted plans policies and regulations 3 to promote multiple modes of transportation including biking walking and transit use with compact development of an appropriate scale 4 to provide a mix of housing types within and within walking distance of mixeduse nodes and corridors 5 to achieve development that is appropriate in scale and intensity for the neighborhoods and sites proximate to the train station

subject zoning district   descriptions 1 storefront bilding a a storefront building is a mixeduse building located at the front and corner property lines allowing easy access to passing pedestrians parking may be provided in the rear of the lot internally in the building or in some cases one doubleloaded aisle of parking is permitted in the interior side yard at the front property line b ground floor uses are limited to those with some level of pedestrian activity such as retail service and office uses with additional commercial office andor residential uses in the upper stories storefronts with large amounts of transparency and regularly spaced entrances off the street are utilized on the ground floor front facade 2 general building a general building is limited in terms of uses by the district within which it is located generally housing office andor residential uses similar to storefront buildings general buildings are intended to be built close to the front and corner property lines allowing easy access to passing pedestrians and transit riders parking may be provided in the rear of the lot internally in the building or in some cases one doubleloaded aisle of parking is permitted in the interior or the side yard at the front property line 3 row building a a row building is a building comprised of multiple vertical units each with its own entrance to the street this building type may be organized as townhouses or rowhouses and may also be livework units with a publicly accessed ground story b parking is required to be located in the rear yard and may be incorporated either into a detached garage or in an attached garaged accessed from the rear of the building however when the garage is located within the building a minimum level of occupied space is required on the front facade to ensure that the street facade is active 4 civic building a civic building is a more flexible building type intended only for civic and institutional types of uses these buildings are distinctive within the community fabric created by the other building types in contrast to most of the other building types a minimum setback line is required instead of a build to zone

features that were lawfully established butbecause of the adoption of new or amended regulationsno longer comply with one or more requirements of this zoning ordinance   intent a occasionally lots uses structures and other development features that were lawfully established ie in compliance with all regulations in effect at the time of their establishment have been made nonconforming because of changes in the zoning regulations that apply to the subject property eg map amendments or amendments to the text of this zoning ordinance the regulations of this article are intended to clarify the effect of such nonconforming status and avoid confusion with illegal buildings and uses those established in violation of applicable zoning regulations the regulations are also intended to 1 recognize the interests of property owners in continuing to use their property for uses and activities that were lawfully established  2 promote maintenance reuse and rehabilitation of existing nonconforming buildings  and 3 place reasonable limits on nonconformities that have the potential to adversely affect surrounding properties b the regulations recognize that buildings and structures have a long useful life and allowing their continued occupancy and modernization can be more desirable than requiring them to remain vacant if they cannot be made conforming consequently this ordinance authorizes the planning and zoning commission to allow conversion of nonconforming uses and under limited circumstances expansions of nonconforming uses and structures   authority to continue any nonconformity that existed on the effective date specified in or any situation that becomes nonconforming upon adoption of any amendment to this zoning ordinance may be continued in accordance with the regulations

are reliable and adequate to document nonconforming status common examples of evidence that may be determined to be reliable and adequate include 1 professional registrations or licenses associated with a street address  2 utility billing records  3 leasing records  4 advertisements in dated publications  5 listings in telephone or business directories  and 6 notarized affidavits affirming the date of lawful establishment of the nonconformity d the community development directors determination of nonconforming status may be appealed in accordance with   repairs and maintenance a
