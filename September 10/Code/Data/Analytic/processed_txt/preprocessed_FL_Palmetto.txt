order to maintain general government police parks and recreation and roadway facilities at an acceptable level of service so as to maintain quality of life in the city in order to finance the necessary new capital improvements and to purchase necessary equipment several combined financing methods will be necessary one 1 of which will require new developments to pay a general government police parks and recreation and roadway impact fee which does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of new general government police parks and recreation and roadway facilities b providing general government police parks and recreation and roadway facilities is a recognized proprietary power of the city s   and is in the best interests of the publics health safety and welfare c implementing a regulatory scheme that requires new development to pay a general government police parks and recreation and roadway impact fee that does not exceed a pro

improvements taking into account and implementing credits based on other future revenue contributions that would assist in funding the improvements thus new growth will help pay for itself and the existing residents of the city will not have the full financial burden of providing increased general government police parks and recreation and roadway capacity at the outset e it is the purpose of this article to establish a system to assist in providing increased capacity for the general government police parks and recreation and roadway operations to accommodate the increased demand new development will have on the existing operations new land development activity will be required to pay a fee which does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated costs of new general

value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city the applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or
