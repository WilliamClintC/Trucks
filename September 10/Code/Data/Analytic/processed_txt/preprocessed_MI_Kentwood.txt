 cross reference licenses permits and miscellaneous business regulations ch 26 intent and purpose the purpose of this chapter is to provide regulations for certain high traffic corridors within the city that exhibit unique characteristics not found in other commercial districts in the city and to encourage appropriate development and redevelopment to sustain the economic viability of the district the regulations herein are based on the following findings a the shallow depth and adjacent residential districts and uses of many of the parcels along arterial routes make it difficult to arrange a site plan that can meet the setback parking and buffer standards required of other commercial districts in this ordinance b the city wishes to encourage combinations of parcels to increase lot widths and depths to allow successful commercial development while allowing sufficient area to adequately protect adjacent residential land uses c the longterm viability of singlefamily residential uses along some arterial corridors is a concern these residential uses are subject to high traffic volumes and future street widening these factors call into question the longterm use of residential properties with shallow front yard setbacks d uses appropriate for this district must be accommodated within relatively small lots and must be compatible with the adjacent residential neighborhoods e establishing setbacks closer to the street than what is required in other commercial districts is considered appropriate given the unique conditions of this district and an objective to increase pedestrian activity along the street table of uses and parking a the following abbreviations apply to the table of uses and parking p land andor buildings in this district may be used for

of anchoring signs and to regulate the time place and manner of their display b this chapter involves a determination by the city that the individual users rights to convey a message must be balanced against the publics right to be free of signs which unreasonably compete distract drivers and pedestrians and produce confusion in balancing the individual users desire to attract attention with the publics right to be free of unreasonable distractions it is recognized that sign regulations should afford businesses a reasonable opportunity to attract the public it is also determined  however oversized projecting or crowded signs can lead to pedestrian and driver confusion and distraction and endanger the public health safety and welfare to lessen such adverse consequences reasonable limitations are appropriate with respect to the placement construction size and design of signs particularly in relation to the location of buildings and the availability of other means of communication in addition new advanced sign display technologies may have adverse impacts that must be minimized by reasonable restrictions on size and permitted locations c the city further determines that overall regulations for signs especially number size and placement are desirable in order to 1 prevent or limit traffic or pedestrian accidents injuries deaths and property damages resulting from obstructed vision distraction or confusion to the public or to emergency safety personnel  2 minimize the risk of damage and injuries from signs that are dilapidated wind blown electric shock hazards etc  3 achieve some uniformity and balance in the size number and placement of signs  4 enhance the aesthetics of the community  5 prevent blight  6 encourage equality among business and

to protect the health safety and welfare of the public by recognizing the need for buildings and sites to be illuminated for safety security and visibility for pedestrians and motorists balanced against the often detrimental affects associated with the use of outdoor lighting this chapter provides standards for various forms of lighting that will minimize light pollution  reduce the potential for offsite impacts  preserve the restful quality of nighttime by eliminating intrusive artificial light and lighting that unnecessarily contributes to sky glow  reduce light pollution and light trespass from light sources onto adjacent properties  enhance customer and employee safety  contribute to improving visibility by requiring illuminated areas to have uniform light  and curtail the degradation of the nighttime visual environment applicability the standards in this chapter shall apply to any light source visible beyond the property from which it is emanating the zoning administrator may review any building or site to determine compliance with the requirements under this chapter whenever a person is required to obtain a building permit electrical permit for outdoor lighting or illuminated signs a special land use approval subdivision approval or site plan approval from the city the applicant shall submit sufficient information to enable the zoning administrator or hisher designee andor planning commission to determine whether the proposed lighting will comply with this chapter lighting definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this chapter shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning a average illumination the overall average of all points on the surface of the illuminated area including the brightest and dimmest points b canopy structure any overhead protective structure which is constructed in a manner to allow pedestriansvehicles to pass under c flood light a fixture designed to flood a welldefined area with light d footcandle fc a unit of illumination produced on a surface all points of which are one foot from a uniform point source equivalent to one candle in brightness of illumination e glare the sensation produced by a bright source within the visual field that is sufficiently brighter than the level to which the eyes are adapted to cause annoyance discomfort or loss in visual performance and visibility  blinding light the magnitude of glare depends on factors such as the size position brightness of the source and on the brightness level to which the eyes are adapted f lamp the component of the luminaire that produces the actual light including luminous tube lighting g lamp lumen depreciation lld factor between 00 and 10 used to describe how the lamp output changes with time compared to the initial output depends principally on lamp type typical lld factors for outdoor lighting types are as follows metal halide

include an assembly housing a mounting bracket or pole socket a lamp holder a ballast a reflector or mirror and a refractor or lens a light fixture also includes the assembly for luminous tube and fluorescent lighting j light pollution artificial light which causes a detrimental effect on the environment enjoyment of the night sky or causes undesirable glare or unnecessary illumination of adjacent properties k light trespass the shining of light produced by a luminaire beyond the boundaries of the property on which it is located l luminaire the complete lighting system including the lamp and light fixture m luminaire dirt depreciation ldd factor between 00 and 10 used to describe how much light produced by the lamp is lost to dirt accumulation and other changes in the optical characteristics of the luminaire relative to the value when the luminaire is new depends on the quality of the luminaire materials used maintenance environment n mounting height the vertical distance between the surface to be illuminated and the bottom of the light source o outdoor light fixtures outdoor artificial illuminating devices outdoor fixtures lamps and other similar devices permanently installed or portable used for flood lighting general illumination or advertisement p shielded fixture outdoor light fixtures shielded or constructed so that light rays emitted by the fixture are projected below the horizontal plane passing lowest point on the fixture from which light is emitted ie a shoeboxtype fixture or a cutoff fixture as defined by the illuminating engineering society of north america the fixtures almost always have a flat horizontally oriented lens and opaque usually metal sides a luminaire mounted in a recessed fashion under a canopy or other structure so that the surrounding structure effectively shields the light in the same manner is also considered fully shielded for the purposes of this chapter lamp lumens q spot light a lighting assembly designed to direct the output of a contained lamp in a specific tightly focused direction a beam with a reflector located external to the lamp r uniformity in outdoor lighting uniformity is a measure indicating how evenly light is distributed across a surface typically the measure is expressed as a ratio of one value to another such as average to minimum or maximum to minimum using ratios perfect uniformity would be  submittal requirements the following information must be included for all site plan submissions which include any new exterior lighting and where site plan approval is not required some or all of the items may be required by the zoning administrator prior to lighting installation a location of all outdoor lighting fixtures including but not limited to freestanding pole fixtures buildingmounted and canopy light fixtures on the site plan and building elevations  b photometric grid overlaid on the proposed site plan indicating the light intensity throughout the site in footcandles measurements must be at ground level and shown at tenfoot spacing  c manufacturers specification sheets and details for the type of fixture being proposed including but not limited to the total lumen output type of lamp distribution type and method of shielding  d maximum footcandle calculation minimum footcandle calculation minimum to maximum and minimum to average uniformity ratios

section 2006  e use of fixtures proposed  and f any other information deemed necessary by the zoning administrator in accordance with the intent and purpose of this chapter general standards a unless otherwise permitted within section 2006 or 2008 only shielded fixtures as defined in section 2003 may be used any interior light fixtures that are deemed to be causing glare and therefore not meeting the purpose or intent of this ordinance shall be shielded to prevent glare at the property line b decorative fixtures using lamps with low wattages do not have to be shielded  these include incandescent lamps of 60 watts or less glass tubes filled with neon argon and krypton and any other light source of 50 watts or less decorative luminaries above 50 watts shall have internal andor external reflectors that shield the light source reflector c it is recognized that metal halide and fluorescent lamps are superior lights for color and object recognition when compared to other lamp types such as low and high pressure sodium or mercury vapor therefore use of metal halide and fluorescent lamps is highly encouraged over low or high pressure sodium or mercury vapor lamps it is also recognized that as the lighting industry develops new lamp types are occasionally introduced that may have similar characteristics as the currently preferred types that may also be desirable for use in outdoor lighting d the intensity of light on a site shall not exceed threetenths 03 footcandles at any property line that abuts a residential zoned property or 05 footcandles for any other zoned property to encourage energy conservation it is recognized that some commercial office and industrial sites may desire to share fixtures along property lines or allow light to trespass onto adjacent
