amended from time to time unregulated electronic delivery devices commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes or ecigarettes closely resemble and purposefully mimic the act of smoking by having users inhale vaporized liquid nicotine or other substances created by heat electronic ignition system after testing a number of ecigarettes from two leading manufacturers the food and drug administration fda determined that various samples tested contained not only nicotine but also detectable levels of known carcinogens and toxic chemicals including tobaccospecific nitrosamines and diethylene glycol a toxic chemical used in antifreeze the fdas testing also suggested that quality control processes used to manufacture these products are inconsistent or nonexistent summary of results laboratory analysis of electronic cigarettes conducted by fda food and drug administration fda  ecigarettes produce a vapor of undetermined and potentially harmful substances which may appear similar to smoke emitted by traditional tobacco products their use in workplaces and public places where smoking of traditional tobacco products is prohibited creates concern and confusion and leads

adult uses and entertainment a statement of policy 1 the city council deems it necessary to provide for the special and express regulation of businesses or commercial enterprises which operate as adult body painting studios adult bookstores adult cabarets adult companionship establishments adult hotels or motels adult massage parlors or health clubs adult minimotion picture theaters adult modeling studios adult motion picture arcades or theaters adult novelty businesses adult saunas and similar adultoriented services operating under different names in order to protect the public health safety and welfare and to guard against the inception and transmission of disease the city council further finds that the commercial enterprises such as the types described above and all other similar establishments whose services include sessions offered to adults conducted in private by members of the same or opposite sex and employing personnel with no specialized training are susceptible to operation in a manner contravening subverting or endangering the morals of the community by being the site of acts of prostitution illicit sex and occasions of violent crimes and thus requiring close inspection licensing and regulation 2 the city council also finds that control and regulation of commercial establishments of these types in view of the abuses often perpetrated require intensive efforts by the police department and other departments of the city as a consequence the concentrated use of city services in control detracts from and reduces the level of service available to the rest of the community and thereby diminishes the ability of the city to promote the general health welfare morals and safety of the community in consideration for the necessity on the part of the city to provide numerous services to all segments of the community without a concentration of public services in one area working to the detriment of the members of the general public it is hereby decided
