development a basis for imposing new sewer allocation limitations 1 pursuant to hudson town htc  27014 the town of hudson entered into an intermunicipal agreement with the city of nashua for the purpose of providing wastewater treatment services to the town of hudson the agreement provides the town of hudson 2000000 gallons per day of secondary wastewater treatment  2 the town of hudson is presently undertaking a study as part of its sewer master plan to evaluate methods to reduce infiltration and inflow into the town of hudsons wastewater treatment system that may result in an increase in available sewer capacity  3 the town of hudson wastewater treatment system is presently distributed within an area described in the attached exhibit a town of hudson sewer master plan amendment system boundary and nonsewered parcels before the town of hudson undertakes an expansion of its wastewater treatment system beyond the existing system boundary the town must first provide sewer to all land uses within the presently serviced region and then the town can plan for possible expansion of the wastewater treatment system to those areas outside of the presently serviced area as described in exhibit a  and 4 in november of 1999 the town of hudson board of selectmen adopted a master plan amendment for the town of hudson sewer master plan that master plan amendment indicated that there presently remain approximately 200000 gallons of average daily flow available within the perday limit of 2000000 gallons  27015 general provisions  27017  established by the intermunicipal agreement with the city of nashua therefore in order to protect the public health safety and welfare of the town of hudson and to fairly allocate the remaining sewer capacity among the land uses permitted under

purpose based on the master plan and capital improvements program which assess and balance community development needs with those of the wider region the following growth management article is deemed necessary to control the rate of residential development in hudson for the following reasons  334109 authority this article is adopted as a growth management ordinance under the authority of rsa   334110 findings a promote the development of an economically sound and environmentally stable community which considers and balances local and regional development needs b ensure that hudson accommodates its fair share of regional growth while protecting it from the adverse fiscal traffic and environmental impacts that can result from uncontrolled growth c guide efforts by the town to monitor evaluate and establish a rate of residential growth that is consistent with its capacity for planned and orderly expansion of public services to accommodate growth d provide a mechanism for situations when municipal services are strained due to rapid residential growth to reduce the rate of such growth in order to provide the town the time and opportunity to correct any service deficiencies e protect the health safety and general welfare of the residents of the town of hudson f address the community development goals and objectives of the town of hudson master plan and capital improvements program a hudsons developable land area as estimated by the nashua regional planning commission nrpc is sufficient to support extensive new growth and development according to a 1997 study by nrpc there are approximately 3650 buildable residentially zoned acres out of a total of 17371 acres in hudson b hudsons population increased 393% from 1980 to 199 and 185% from 1990 to 199 for an overall increase of 65% or 34% annually over the nearly twentyyear period by contrast the total population of the communities making up the nashua regional planning commission nrpc region increased by 24% from 1980 to 199 and 13% from  334108 general provisions  334110  1990 to 199 for an overall increase of 44% or 23% annually over the nearly twentyyear period as evidenced by these statistics hudson has grown at a faster rate than the region c the number of housing units in hudson increased by 58% between 1980 and 199 and by 175% between 1990 and 199 for an overall increase of 855% or 45% annually over the nearly twentyyear period by contrast the number of housing units in the nrpc region increased by 385% between 1980 and 199 and by 102% between 1990 and 199 for an overall increase of 527% or 29% annually over the nearly twentyyear period d the average annual rate of new housing unit construction in hudson is greater than the average for a hudson firsttier fairshare region that consists of the six adjacent communities of litchfield londonderry nashua pelham windham and tyngsborough ma in hudson the average annual increase in housing units for the period 1995 to 1999 was 17% compared to a firsttier fairshare region average annual growth rate of 11% e population projections for hudson issued by the new hampshire office of state planning nhosp in 2000 project a 3111 person or 134% increase in population from 2000 to 2010 f high levels of demand for housing in hudson are expected to continue according to the 1999 regional housing needs assessment by nrpc with the region divided into four parts the eastern towns of hudson litchfield and pelham had the largest increase in the number of home sales for the period 1991 to 199 at 116% g as of 199 there were approximately 7965 dwelling units in hudson according to estimates by the nhosp according to a buildout study performed by nrpc for the 1996 hudson master plan there is the potential to add approximately 4700 units in hudsons residential zoning districts an increase of 58% over the 1999 figure h hudsons total population at buildout according to the master plan could approach 33300 persons an increase of 10200 or 44% over the estimated 1999 population of 23100 i the town of hudson in its master plan supports controlled growth as one method of ensuring that the town grows in a sustainable manner landuse goal b3 states that hudson should consider the adoption of growth controls or development phasing to limit population increases and housing development to manageable levels population goal a states that hudson should provide an acceptable rate of growth in relation to the regional rate of growth and in keeping with the ability of the town to provide essential facilities and services j community facilities  334110 hudson code  334110  1 many community facilities in hudson are being adversely impacted by rapid population and housing growth in the community the community facilities section of the 1996 hudson master plan states that the significant and rapid growth that occurred in town over the past years has caused the current town facilities to become
