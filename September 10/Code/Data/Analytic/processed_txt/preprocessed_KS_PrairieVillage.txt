minimum stormwater management requirements and controls on any new development or redevelopment projects this establishes requirements for longterm maintenance of structural controls within the city for drainages into the municipal separate storm sewer system andor into surface waters this ordinance seeks to meet this purpose following objectives a minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding siltation and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels  b minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality particularly if receiving water bodies are classified as impaired on the current version of the 303d listing of impaired waters in kansas as identified by the kansas department of health and environment kdhe  c minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the predevelopment hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable  d reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution wherever possible management best management practices bmps  ensure the bmps are maintained properly  and pose no threat to public safety    14201 pollution discharge the governing body of the city of prairie village hereby finds that pollutants are discharged into surface water wash off and transport of storm water runoff from disturbed land during rainfall events a further the governing body of the city of prairie village hereby finds that such discharge of pollutants may lead to increased risks of disease and harm to individuals particularly children who come into contact with the water  may degrade the quality of such water for human uses such as drinking irrigation recreation and industry  and may damage the natural ecosystems of rivers streams lakes and wetlands leading to a decline in the diversity and abundance of plants and animals b further the governing body of the city of prairie village hereby finds that this ordinance will promote public awareness of damage to water quality water bodies and wetlands caused by storm water runoff from land disturbance activities or increased impervious surfaces c further the governing body of the city of prairie village hereby finds that such discharges are inconsistent with the provisions and goals of the clean water act cwa the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes and other federal and state requirements for water quality and environmental preservation d further the governing body of the city of prairie village hereby finds that the reasonable establishment of restrictions and regulations on land disturbance activities or increased impervious surfaces within the city of prairie village is necessary to eliminate or minimize such storm water runoff to protect the health and safety of citizens to preserve economic and ecological value of existing table of contents water resources within the city of prairie village and within downstream communities and to comply with the provisions of the citys responsibilities under the clean water act and the npdes program e further the governing body of prairie village hereby finds that uncontrolled storm water runoff especially floodwaters can pose a hazard to property both public and private and public infrastructure and can endanger human life these regulations specify certain controls and restrictions to attenuate or avoid flooding within the city and are to supplement the requirements of the city floodplain management requirements f finally the governing body of the city of prairie village hereby finds that the proper management of
