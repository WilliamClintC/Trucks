division applicability permit and application requirements hillside development design guidelines hillside project development standards  purpose of division the standards of this division are intended to apreserve the citys scenic resources by encouraging retention of natural topographic features and vegetation  backnowledge that as the slope of a development site increases so does the potential for environmental degradation including slope failure increased erosion sedimentation and stormwater runoff  and cencourage grading practices that are appropriate in hillside areas  and dencourage structures on hillside parcels to be designed with scale massing architectural design and detailing appropriate to maintain hillsides in a natural open character   applicability asloping sites the standards in this division apply to subdivisions uses structures and to all other development on sites with an average of slope of 20 percent or greater bexceptions the provisions of hillside project development standards shall not apply to parcels within the am altos de monterey overlay zone which are instead subject to the requirements of altos de monterey am overlay district

of a subsequent building permit application cconstraints analysis for properties that have sensitive environmental resources including endangered plants and animals or a wildlife corridor designated by the city a qualified professional approved by the director shall prepare a site constraints analysis in compliance with report shall include proposed mitigation measures to effectively protect important biological features identified     hillside development design guidelines proposed hillside development should satisfy as many of the following objectives as feasible as determined design review process aterrain alteration the project should be designed to fit the terrain rather than altering the terrain to fit the project development patterns that form visually protruding horizontal bands or steeply cut slopes for roads or lots shall be avoided largescale slope terracing cribwalls or significant slope modification is discouraged where alteration of the terrain is necessary contour grading techniques should be utilized to help achieve a natural appearing slope see figure 333 bstreet layout any new streets should follow the natural contours of the terrain to minimize the need for grading culdesacs and loop roads are encouraged where necessary to fit the natural topography subject to the approval of the city engineer and fire chief clocation of structures structures should be located in the most accessible least visually prominent and most geologically stable portion or portions of the site they should also be oriented with the natural contours of the site siting structures in the least visually prominent locations is especially important on open hillsides where the prominence of construction should be minimized by placing structures so that they will be screened by existing vegetation depressions in topography or other natural features dsite layout and structure design building and site design should utilize varying setbacks and structure heights splitlevel foundations and low retaining walls to blend structures into the terrain earchitectural design 1form building forms should complement the character of the hillsides and avoid massive structures that dominate views of the hills 2scale and windowsinfill lots the scale of homes proposed on infill lots should be compatible with buildings on adjacent parcels where feasible windows balconies and outdoor living areas should be located to protect the privacy of adjacent homes and yards 3exterior wall surfaces the apparent size of exterior wall surfaces visible from off the site should be minimized use of single story elements setbacks overhangs roof pitches landscaping andor other means of horizontal and vertical articulation to create changing shadow lines and break up massive forms 4roofs roof pitches should generally be placed to follow the angle of the slope  but with variations to avoid a monotonous appearance see figure 326 image figure 326 design sensitive to terrain note this diagram is intended to provide an example of building form and is not intended to show a preferred architectural style 5support structures support structures for example columns pilings etc below the lowest floor on the downhill side of a house should be enclosed unless visible structural members are an integral feature of the architectural design support structure wall surfaces shall not exceed six feet in height fview protection new construction should not block views from other properties 1where feasible new structures and tall landscaping should not be placed directly in the view of the primary living areas on a neighboring parcel 2new structures should be placed on the lower areas of a hillside site 3mechanical equipment may be placed on rooftops or below a deck only if the equipment is not visible from off the site except for unobtrusive solar collectors that are compatible with the roof line and architecturally integrated with the structure image figure 327 view protection gcolors and materials a mixture of materials color and forms should be used to blend structures with the natural appearance of the hillsides 1based upon the graphic principle that dark colors are less noticeable than light colors darker tones including earth tones should be used for building walls and roofs on highlyvisible sites so that buildings appear to blend in with the natural terrain 2surface materials should be appropriate for the architectural style of the structure and compatible with the hillside environment hexterior lighting night views of the hillsides should not be dominated by bright lights lighting within highvisibility areas should be properly shielded to avoid glare and the spill of light to surrounding areas lowlevel lighting and the use of multiple low profile fixtures is encouraged as opposed to the use of fewer but taller fixtures iretaining walls large retaining walls in a uniform plane shall be avoided retaining walls shall be divided into terraces with variations in plane and include landscaping to break up the length of walls and to screen them from view no retaining wall shall be higher than six feet and should incorporate a three foot recessed offset feature every 30 feet or other methods of articulation retaining walls more than three feet high that are visible from off the site should be screened with
