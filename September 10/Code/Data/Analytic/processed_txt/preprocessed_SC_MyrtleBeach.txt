vote is required unless the presiding officer asks council to decide the issue or the decision of the presiding officer is appealed the point of order is frequently used to question a procedure undertaken by the presiding officer or to suggest an alternate procedure to the presiding officer l motion to reconsider may only be made before adjournment of the meeting at which the original action was taken must be made by a council member who voted on the winning side on the original action nothing herein should be construed to prevent the original matter from being placed on the agenda for a

decided by council m motion to suspend the rules can be made at any time that no question is pending if a matter is before council and the motion to suspend is applicable to that matter the motion to suspend takes precedence over all other motions it is not debatable or amendable and requires a 23 majority to pass this motion permits council to do something it wishes to do but cannot without violating one or more of the rules contained in its rules of procedure this motion cannot be used to modify or suspend any requirement of state law 7 public hearings a public hearing is a special type of meeting it is intended to provide council the opportunity to gather information from public input and provide information to the public state law requires that a public hearing be conducted under certain circumstances the presiding officer should call the hearing to order and announce the purpose of the hearing the presiding officer should recognize individuals who wish to address council and should ensure that representatives of all competing views have a fair opportunity to express those views the council can take no action during the public hearing a public hearing may be a separate meeting or may be held during a regular council meeting if it is during a regular council meeting it generally occurs at the point on the agenda where the subject of the public hearing is listed for action in that case the presiding officer must clearly announce the start of the hearing and the adjournment of the hearing so that it is clear when the special rules applicable to the hearing apply and when the rules of procedure for regular council business are restored a record of each public hearing must be kept and should include a a hearing agenda b a record of all the members of the public who participate c proof of any required notice or publication d minutes or a tape of the proceedings e copies of any materials received from the public or distributed to the public 8 disruptive conduct these rules of procedure are adopted based on the expectation that all persons attending a meeting of city council will be honorable and will conduct themselves with courtesy for all other individuals present in most situations where an individuals conduct becomes disruptive it will be inadvertent and a warning from the presiding officer will be sufficient to correct the offensive behavior if that is not the case or if the presiding officer is determined by council to be disrupting or obstructing the proceedings of a council meeting the following shall apply a it is unlawful for any person to disrupt a meeting of city council if a person who is determined by the presiding officer or by a majority vote of council to be disruptive refuses to discontinue the disruptive behavior the matter will be immediately reported to the police department who will upon responding take necessary action to end the disruption action by the police may include if necessary removing the offending individual from the meeting room b in a case where the disruptive person is a member of council a determination that the disruptive behavior is in violation of these rules shall be made by a majority vote of council c notwithstanding the provisions of section 222 if the presiding officer refuses to call for action on a matter on an approved agenda ignores a motion apparently made and seconded in good faith refuses to allow council to vote on an appeal from a decision or ruling of the presiding officer or in any other way refuses to conduct the meeting in accordance with these rules council may by majority vote declare the chair vacated any council member may move to vacate the chair based on the refusal of the presiding officer and upon receiving a second the member who made the motion may call for the immediate vote of council if the motion receives a majority vote the position of presiding officer shall be filled for the remainder of the meeting as provided in subsection b3 above as if the presiding officer were absent unless the original presiding officer is removed from the meeting as provided in subsection b8a above he or she shall be permitted to remain in the meeting and participate as any other council member 9 items not covered any matter or order of procedure not covered by these rules shall be referred to the presiding officer who shall decide the matter in conformity with the purpose of these rules the decision of the presiding officer may be reversed on appeal by a majority vote of council  these motions may be made at any time that they are relevant to the issue presently on the floor or the decision which has just been made          state law reference council to determine its own rules and order of business sc b footnotes  3  note the south carolina freedom of information act requires that an agenda be advertised 24 hours before the scheduled meeting time it has been argued by some parties that this prevents the amendment of the agenda after the advertisement the better argument seems to be that when it is necessary in the public interest to add a matter to the agenda after it is published council may do so  4  note when related to the item being considered an executive session may be held at the time a matter is being discussed if a majority of council votes to do so  5  note there is no state law requirement that public input be accepted during the consideration of a resolution or ordinance with limited exceptions there is no state law requirement for a public hearing on a resolution or ordinance it has long

declarations the city council finds that the rightsofway and public places are expected to be used for the purposes for which they were designed and constructed to perform the function of public access business advancement and safe vehicular and pedestrian travel while simultaneously allowing the constitutionally protected right of free speech in those portions of public property that have historically and traditionally been forums of free speech these reasonable public expectations should be balanced with reasonable time place and manner restrictions so that all citizens and visitors may safely enjoy the full function of these public facilities and the purposes for which they are intended there are other places to which the public is invited that are on private property as part of a pleasing aesthetic environment that enhances our tourist trade businesses are required by zoning to set aside and maintain privately owned landscaped areas or open space areas that abut the public rightofway or that are accessible by the public rightofway this private property is readily accessible to the general public or is otherwise open to common or general use or view such as parking lots landscaped areas or private alleys there exist vacant or undeveloped land and lots the public has passed without obstruction all of these private properties are impacted by the public rightofway and impact the rightofway when obstructions are allowed to exist in some areas sidewalks are only five feet in width and whose uses are further restricted by necessary utility structures street trees and refuse collection containers in some areas streets are 40 to 60 feet wide and are heavily traveled access routes for the beach even nonaggressive monetary solicitation impedes the normal flow of traffic both pedestrian and vehicular disrupts passage and is inherently more intrusive and complicated activity than the mere distributing literature certain streets and sidewalks of myrtle beach are subject to congestion and the council finds that restrictions on conduct and all aggressive and nonaggressive solicitation that results in obstruction of passage inaccessible parking congesting vehicle traffic and stressful and anxious pedestrian interactions are appropriate in order to keep the traffic moving this commercial area of pedestrian and vehicular concentration and congestion compels the council to act to prohibit begging and panhandling city wide even nonaggressive solicitation has an element of coercion and impedes the normal flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic  in that solicitation requires reaction and action by those who would respond the concentration of amusements outdoor seating and cafs where visitors and citizens are queuing or seated for service or attractions requires protection of the commercial interests and the comfort and safety of the customer moreover the concentration of national and international visitors who find themselves under stress in unfamiliar settings often time facing a language or cultural barrier when approached by strangers seeming demanding something from them even if the language barrier is overcome and being faced by a stranger in a strange town is not stressful or creates anxiety the individual solicited must decide whether or not to contribute which itself might involve examining the solicitors goods or enticements to commerce or hearing his pitch and then having decided to do so reach for a wallet search it for money write a check or produce a credit card both nonaggressive and aggressive solicitations in these densely peopled areas or in areas do create a besieged atmosphere and makes people feel uncertain and unsafe as they move about the council is informed that visitors often act to avoid being solicited perceiving that they are being constantly set upon by the solicitors asking for money asking for donations asking for a contribution asking for spare change asking for a dollar in exchange for some form of goods and the uncertainty of how to respond and the inconvenience of dealing with strangers approaching you in an unfamiliar area in a tourist town diminishes the safety and convenience of the citizens and visitors thus impacting the public economy the city has a legitimate interest in promoting the safety and convenience of its tourists and citizens on public streets in these densely peopled areas and so would create a protected zone while still allowing such solicitations and commercial handbilling elsewhere in the city and would still allow noncommercial handbilling as set forth herein in as exercise of the first amendment under reasonable time place and manner restrictions the myrtle beach convention center and its premises are declared to be a unique structure and land use dedicated to the convention center business model as a commercial facility to foster economic development and use by businesses and organizations which reserve and rent the facility and its premises to convey their commercial message the unique characteristics of this convention center business model compel that it is to be subject to time place and manner restrictions as to use and speech and that sections may vary as to the use and speech appropriate for the section there also exist publicly owned facilities such as the oceanfront and the myrtle beach convention center that were not designed or built to be in the same categories as the public streets and parks as forums for expressive activities there also exist publicly owned land which has been legislatively made subject to encroachment to enhance the commercial activity of the abutting private property such as ocean front and sometimes boardwalk adjacent hard and soft encroachments the myrtle beach boardwalk is declared to be a unique structure of limited recreational use and passage designed and built not as sidewalk or street park or traditional public forum but a tourist and resident amenity and as public facility stimulus to foster economic development and commercial encroachment use by a abutting businesses by extending outdoor dining and seating for its patrons it extends from its northern terminus at the 15th avenue north pier to its southern terminus at 1st avenue north street end the northern section is from 14th avenue north pier to the northern border of plyler park characterized entirely by hotel beach frontage the central section extends from the northern border of plyler park the southern border of 8th avenue north characterized entirely by retail and entertainment business the southern section is from the southern 8th avenue north to the southern terminus at 1st avenue north characterized by a mixture of hotel and retail predominantly hotel frontage the current boardwalk is likely to be augmented in both the southern and northern directions and the restrictions set forth herein will apply to any later additions to the boardwalk the unique characteristics of changing zoning uses with its mixture of encouraged commercial encroachment use tourist residential and recreational use compel that it is to be distinguished from quintessential public forums and its uniqueness requires that it be subject to time place and manner restrictions as to use and that sections of the boardwalk may vary as to the use appropriate for the section the city council finds that the boardwalk should not be used as a forum for either nonaggressive or aggressive off premise canvassing begging solicitation in exchange for money handbilling or picketing due to its unique recreational nature the public beach is a unique asset and millions of visitors are drawn to the public beaches every year and year round the public beaches are used for entertainment and recreational purposes and commercialization detracts from that use visitors do not want to be accosted or approached in effort to sell them something or persuade them on an issue while they are lying down with their eyes closed sunbathing or attending to their small children ample opportunities and places currently exist for citizens to engage in person to person commercial endeavors nonaggressive begging handbilling or picketing under this article and the city council finds that the public beach should not be used as a forum for either nonaggressive or aggressive off premise canvassing begging solicitation in exchange for money handbilling or picketing due to its unique recreational nature the city council finds that public has a reasonable expectation that public parks designed built and maintained for different purposes may be enjoyed for those purposes while still maintaining the public park as a forum for expressive activities parks are designed for families with children individuals and group to engage in fellowship play and relaxation in a pastoral setting the council is informed that both nonaggressive and aggressive solicitations in these areas does create a besieged and uncertain atmosphere making people feel unsafe as they move about or rest in a park or play with their children the council finds that persons perceive that they are being constantly set upon by the strangers walking up to them or their children asking for money asking for donations asking for a contribution asking for spare change asking for a dollar in exchange for some form of goods and the mere act of being approached in a demanding way by a stranger creates uncertainty of how to respond and the inconvenience of dealing with strangers approaching you as you engage in your park use with your children or grandchildren or as you try to relax the city has a legitimate interest in promoting the safety and convenience of its citizens in the parks ample opportunities and places currently exist outside of the parks for citizens to engage in person to person commercial endeavors or commercial handbilling under this article and the city council finds that the public parks should not be used as a forum for panhandling off premise canvassing solicitation in exchange for money or commercial handbilling due to its reasonable expectations that public parks are not appropriate for unrestricted commercial activity and have the same need for public safety and convenience that exists in the protected zone the city council finds and declares that uncontrolled commercial and noncommercial speech involved in handbilling picketing soliciting and canvassing results in negative impacts on the rightsofway negative impacts on the use of public facilities by visitors and citizens and often in the throwing casting and distributing of material upon public and residential property without consent thus creating widespread litter that adversely affects the aesthetics of the rightsofway in the city neighborhood litter contributes to a serious police problem in that the accumulation of the material on the rightofway and neighbors express that the property of the residence so littered is an open invitation to burglary the city council finds that unregulated camping in prohibited public places creates a health and safety hazard for those who illegally camp and for those residents and visitors who come into contact with the campsites and adversely affects the quality of life of a considerable number of citizens the city council finds that a public safety problem is created by persons sleeping in automobiles which are parked along the public streets within the city in residential areas alarm and anxiety result in calls for service in addition persons who are parked in developed areas by the nature of the conduct become unaware of their surrounding this making themselves vulnerable as targets for criminal activity as to public sidewalks the city council further finds and declares 1 public sidewalks in business districts are created and maintained for the primary purposes of enabling pedestrians to safely and efficiently move about from place to place facilitating deliveries of goods and services and providing potential customers with convenient access to goods and services 2 during business hours the public sidewalks in downtown and neighborhood commercial areas are prone to congestion and should be kept available to serve these primary purposes 3 except in places provided herein or where reasonably necessary sitting or lying on the public sidewalks in downtown and neighborhood commercial interferes with the primary purposes of the public sidewalks threatens public safety and damages the public welfare 4 pedestrians particularly the elderly disabled or visionimpaired are put at increased risk when they must see and navigate around individuals sitting or lying upon the public sidewalk 5 the public welfare is promoted by economically healthy downtown neighborhood commercial areas which attract people to shop work and recreate these areas provide easily accessible goods and services employment opportunities the tax revenues necessary to support essential public services and the economic productivity necessary to maintain and improve property within these areas 6 in some circumstances and places in the city obstruction of passage by congregation or sitting or lying on the sidewalks acts to deter many members of the public from frequenting those areas which contributes to undermining the essential economic viability of those areas business failures and relocations can cause vacant storefronts which contribute to a spiral of deterioration and blight which harms the public health safety and welfare an important factor in protecting public safety is attracting people to the streets and sidewalks of the citys business districts because the presence of many law abiding citizens serves as a deterrent to crime and increases the publics sense of security and the safety of all 7 there are other places within or close to the downtown and neighborhood commercial areas where sitting or lying down can be accommodated without unduly interfering with the safe flow of pedestrian traffic impairing commercial activity threatening public safety or harming the public welfare these other places include city parks private property with the permission of the property owner public sidewalks outside the designated business districts and all sidewalks outside the designated hours therefore the limited regulation of sitting or lying down on sidewalks is both reasonably necessary and appropriately balances the public interest and individual rights publicly accessible parking garages lots are characterized by the constant travel of vehicles in restricted spaces and lanes the use of individual wheeled devices that do not have a mechanical braking system are incompatible with the travel of vehicles in this context and such use presents a real danger of personal and property injury now therefore the city council finds that the inappropriate use of the rightofway and restricted public places is injurious and inimical to the public economy health safety and welfare of the visitors and residents and that such practices are therefore declared to unlawful and a public nuisance        the following words terms and phrases when used in this chapter have the meanings ascribed to them in this section except where the context clearly indicates a

findings by city council whereas based upon the input of the planning commissions work on corridor studies residents complaints the advice of law enforcement and the administration and upon its own collective knowledge of traffic issues in the city  and being further based upon the submittal and roadway classification system of the city engineer the city council finds that recurring and incidentnonrecurring congestion dramatically impact and disrupt normal functional operation of the transportation system as a result of increased travel demand andor decrease in roadway capacity the existence of congestion traffic is inimical to public health safety and welfare the purpose of congestion traffic management is to reduce the intensity of motor vehicle use during peak hour congestion thereby easing gridlock in movement and encouraging commuters to take alternate routes walk bicycle or take mass transit as an alternative because of its narrow and linear shape the city uniquely has roads with characteristics that blend into separate classifications that require a unique approach to congestion mitigation the goals of mitigation are to relieve congestion in less intense areas that have become overburdened and to distribute motor vehicle traffic within the roadway system of classifications this will allow the congestion points to ease particularly in impacted arterial collector and local roads and will reduce delays and motorist frustration over traffic which seemingly does not move when traffic volume would elevate a road into the next category of intensity of use beyond its geometric design or demand capacity reduced congestion will benefit those who continue to drive in the form of faster more predictable commutes essential trips particularly emergency vehicles delivery vehicles and small business owners will become less susceptible to trafficrelated delays management will improve our citys air quality and protect our quality of life by reducing congestion at certain critical roadway segments promoting managed movement of vehicles and more fairly allow citizens and visitors alike to utilize key transportation corridors this article in no way limits law enforcement officers discretion in emergency or exigent circumstances to take such action as is prudent to protect the publics health safety or welfare  definitions congestion traffic is a condition of oversaturation or increasing intense use on public roads systems when traffic demands exceed roadway capacity oversaturation exists where roadway demand exceeds capacity such that significant vehicle queuing exists which can also be characterized as gridlock and where greater vehicular density and close vehicle spacing results in little to no movement when more than one lane is available andor where little to no entry or exist from the travel lane exists with little to no forward movement in essence it is the difference between the street network system performance that is in place and what users expect and how the system actually performs or degrades in performance under certain conditions for purposes of this article congestion traffic is either recurring or incidentnonrecurring in origin incidentnonrecurring traffic congestion is caused by specific random traffic incidents planned or unplanned special events weather conditions work zones and emergency events these incidents or nonrecurring events dramatically reduce the level of service and reliability of the entire transportation system incident traffic congestion dramatically impacts overall areawide and citywide commuter health and safety vehicular and pedestrian mobility and travel time reliability for visitors and residents alike incident traffic congestion requires aggressive applications and management to reduce the impacts of these disruptions and return the system to normal operation and full capacity planned or unplanned special events for the purposes of this article include outdoor sporting events concerts festivals fireworks displays and conventions occurring at permanent multiuse venues eg arenas stadiums racetracks fairgrounds amphitheaters convention centers etc they also include less frequent public events such as parades bicycle races marathons seasonal festivals and milestone celebrations at temporary venues that involve the use of the public way and also include sporadic or cyclical events such as automobile or motorcycle rallies which are a gathering of riders drivers and enthusiasts scheduled and sponsored by specific clubs associations event planners andor organizers event promoters vendors dealers or vendor permit sellers for the purpose of retail sales to attendees who expect and are provided a variety of vending opportunities and entertainment events by those who profit from the gathering the term special event is not used to denote the perceived quality of the event or to imply that one entity is necessarily in charge of organizing or managing the event but is used to describe these types of activities because of their known shared characteristics of widespread promotion by those seeking profit with a location identified as the place of gathering or rally with a published or publicly known time of occurrence either sporadic cyclical or scheduled the resulting congestion can be attributed to event promotion or staging or lack of planning or control by event promoters or organizers planned or unplanned special events can dramatically impact overall travel safety vehicular and pedestrian mobility and travel time reliability for visitors and residents alike it is anticipated that those events that seek and obtain a special events permits shall have a traffic component that address anticipated congestion traffic however should the plan prove inadequate law enforcement has the flexibility to implement traffic congestion counter measures including but not limited to those measure contained herein recurring traffic congestion is caused by inadequacies in roadway capacity demanded for the greater number of vehicles normally in peak travel periods mitigation of recurring congestion includes the development and deployment of traffic control the addition of roadway capacity andor and travel demand management strategies designed to improve operation andor safety on congested highway facilities during peak travel periods recurring congestion is experienced virtually every day this is the type of congestion where there are simply more vehicles than roadway at known times

identified area the city engineer is responsible for the current state of classification for the purposes of this article queuing means a closely spaced collection of vehicles traffic incidents mean traffic slowdowns due to emergency response natural events such as smoke producing fires of vehicles land or dwellings vehicle crashes pedestrian interference with vehicular movement or disabled or

completed the potw will establish discharge limits for any pollutants that should be controlled when developing the discharge limits the following shall be taken into consideration 1 categorical limits these are established as federal requirements the potw cannot establish limits that are less stringent than these requirements but can establish more stringent limits 2 hazardous waste management regulations if the sewage sludge solids are to be disposed of as a nonhazardous waste the sludge solids must be nontoxic not ignitable nonreactive and noncorrosive if the sewage sludge solids contain any of the materials in appendix iv of the hazardous waste management regulations they may be designated as hazardous wastes and will be required to be disposed of in a hazardous waste landfill appendix iv of the hazardous waste management regulations and additional information concerning the parameters that the potw should analyze for in the sewage sludge solids are available for review at the department of engineering and public services 3 drinking water standards if a pollutant is passing wastewater treatment plant but is not a categorical pollutant a limit for that pollutant shall be established to prevent the concentration of that pollutant in the receiving stream from exceeding the drinking water standard for that pollutant 4 construction permit limits these are limits that shall be established as a condition for a nondomestic discharger to obtain from the state department of health and environmental control a permit to construct a pretreatment system 5 water quality standards these are limits for pollutants to prevent an impact on the aquatic life in the receiving stream these limits may be found in the epa publication quality criteria for water 6 npdes limits these are limits for the discharge from the potw and are set by the state department of health and environmental control and the epa 7 operation and maintenance considerations the potw

the treatment processes endangering the physical structures of the collection and treatment system or endangering potw personnel or the public health and safety 3 determine the amount of the contaminant that may be present in the normal domestic sewage 4 establish a safety factor for future growth in the community in the form of additional domestic dischargers and nondomestic dischargers 5 subtract the amount of the contaminant contributed by the domestic dischargers and the amount saved for the safety factor from the maximum amount that can enter the wastewater treatment plant 6 distribute the remaining amount of the contaminant equitably among the nondomestic dischargers that discharge the contaminants to the potw for a more detailed explanation of these steps see appendix d

result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these hazards are caused by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses which are vulnerable to floods because they are inadequately elevated or not otherwise protected from flood damage therefore it is the intent of this ordinance to lessen such hazards and losses by restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood  by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods be protected against flood hazards at the time of initial construction  and by controlling filling grading alteration of natural protective barriers placing of obstructions or other activities uses or characteristics of use which may increase flood damage 1101a objectives the objectives of this ordinance are to protect human life and health  to minimize the expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  to minimize prolonged business interruptions  to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electrical telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in the floodplains  to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  and to insure that potential buyers are notified that a property is in a floodplain 1101b warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes this ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted with such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages this ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the city of myrtle beach or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder 1101c interpretation in the interpretation and application of this ordinance all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of

doug shaw stadium ocean boulevard entertainment overlay district obeod 1807a purpose and intent the city of myrtle beach finds that 1 without debate the citys economic engine is tourism 2 sustaining tourism is essential to maintain our standard of living the funding of our amenities for our citizens and for the preservation of property values 3 tourism is threatened by perceived unseemliness or unsafety in any particular area 4 the perception of unseemliness or unsafety is to large degree a product of atmosphere 5 the atmosphere of a location is comprised of many factors one of which is whether a location is suitable and safe for children and families 6 one component of atmosphere for a location is the proliferation of retail offerings of businesses in that area that are not family attractive 7 certain retail offerings create an atmosphere that is repulsive to mothers and fathers in the care of their children in that retail outlets are promoting crudity and sexually explicit apparel drug paraphernalia and consumables that mimic and promote drug and substance consumption 8 the purpose of the ocean boulevard entertainment overlay district obeod is to establish a family friendly entertainment and retail land use and encourage compatible land uses ensure higher quality development and business uses and function in order to protect property values and provide safe and efficient pedestrian and automobile access 9 these retail restrictions and criteria can encourage quality development and economic growth while continuing to provide for a wide range of economic development opportunities throughout the city for those uses which are incompatible with the obeod 10 the displacement of cbd consumables smoke shops and tobacco stores is necessary and in the interests of the public health safety and general welfare because there is the substantial likelihood of the establishment and operation of 368 overlay zone regulations city of myrtle beach sc zoning ordinance expanded retail offerings of cbd consumables smoke shops and tobacco stores in the obeod 11 the continued operation and expansion of these family adverse retail offerings in the overlay would result in undesirable impacts to the public economy of the overlay 12 among these impacts are increased potential for cbd consumables and tobacco sales to minors greater opportunity for the sale of illegal drug paraphernalia that is marketed as tobacco paraphernalia and heightened risk of negative aesthetic impacts blight and loss of property values of residential neighborhoods and businesses in close proximity to such uses 13 this overlay contains amendments consistent with good zoning and planning practices to address such negative impacts of smoke shops and tobacco stores while providing a reasonable number of locations and zones for such shops stores to locate within the city of myrtle beach 14 the obeod is intended to encourage mixeduse within the same structure or block andor high intensity commercial development which provides a wide array of entertainment and retail options without the current family unfriendly environment promoting unhealthy tobacco use crudity and the stigma of drug use and paraphernalia 15 in the event of a conflict between the entitlements regulations or standards established in the obeod and the equivalent provisions in the underlying zoning districts the provisions of the obeod shall govern 16 families are the center of all communities the building blocks of our city and the basis of a sustained tourism economy the council is determined to see a family friendly lens placed over all policies strategies and initiatives undertaken and supported by the council 1807b boundaries the boundaries of the obeod are as indicated in

following pages offer ideas and requirements for renovation and new construction in our revitalizing downtown detailed guidelines are included for storefronts entryways signs awnings sidewalks upper stories rear faades color schemes building placement & dimensions roof forms parking areas and landscaping the goal of all building improvements should be to make each building the best possible expression of itself that it can be these design guidelines will steer property owners developers tenants and design professionals improvement projects while keeping in mind that each building is unique the guidelines are intended to suggest ways in which property and business owners can take advantage of the unique charm and history of downtown myrtle beach remember city approval by the community appearance board before issuance of all commercial building permits sign permits and awning permits although the community appearance board will be referring to these guidelines when making their decisions adherence to these guidelines does not guarantee approval by the board 396 5 architectural style the core of downtown myrtle beach was built primarily in the first two decades of the 20th century architects generally utilized two different architectural styles that blend together nicely in our coastal town all renovations improvements and new construction should visually blend with the architectural style of the surrounding buildings mediterranean the mediterranean style is a unique adaptation of spanish and moorish architecture the splendor of this architecture can still be enjoyed in the faade of the chapin building on main street elements include prominent main entries courtyards balconies cross ventilation loggias and towers materials include masonry stucco and terra cotta colors are muted pastels and naturals 397 6 georgian typical georgian structures are symmetrical with gabled roofs often including dormers although pyramidal and other roof forms were used city hall is a classic example of this formal and dignified style materials varied widely from wood to brick and stone entrances were emphasized and ornately decorated with transoms or fanlights over the door and columns or pilasters piers made to look like columns frequently taking the form of one or two story porticoes porches elements include a projecting faade band course pediment cornice modillion course brick or stone quoin and dormers classical details surround the windows and doors and cornices columns pilasters and quoins outside corners window elements include a double hung sash muntin keystone splayed lintel and louvered shutters materials include brick stone plaster and wood renovation consistency in design and proportion is important in conveying how our downtown is perceived by the customer seeking goods and services the integrity of a building as an individual structure as part of a series of buildings and as a part of a neighborhood should be respected take care to insure that your design blends well with surrounding buildings sidewalks and other public improvements a visually unified downtown is a powerful tool for attracting people to our downtown and to the individual shops and businesses located there step back and look at your property from across the street from the corner from nearby intersections what does the community see some things like air conditioning units and satellite dishes are more noticeable from a distance 398 7 traditional faade the storefront is a distinct entity that demands a complete design statement not just the remodeling of a doorway or the addition of a new wall surface changes have occurred to our buildings during the years in response to various merchandising trends and changing tenants in most cases the changes affected the storefront area while leaving the upper faade intact in some cases the original storefronts may still be in place but covered over or in need of maintenance or repair the traditional commercial storefront can be the most important element that gives historical significance and character to the downtown the traditional commercial faade consists of three parts  the storefront with an entrance and large display windows   the upper masonry faade with regularly spaced windows  and  the decorative cornice that caps the building these components may appear in various shapes sizes and styles but the result is essentially consistent with the traditional faade 1st floor storefront design the traditional downtown building faade has a welldefined opening that was filled by the original storefront the opening is bounded on each side by piers which were usually constructed of masonry it is bounded on top by the band course or the storefront cornice the structural element supporting the upper faade and bounded below by the sidewalk the storefront was composed almost entirely of windows the large glass opening served to display goods the store or business had to sell it also allowed natural light deep into the store thus minimizing the need for an artificial light source 399 8 the visual transparency of the storefront is also important because it is part of the overall proportion system of the faade the proportion of window  to  wall areas in the traditional faade calls for more glass and less wall at the storefront level balanced by more wall and less glass on the upper faade it is important that these proportions be maintained so that downtown myrtle beach will be unified by consistent design thus making it an attractive place for customers to do business improvements in considering improvements to the storefront it is very important that the original opening be recognized and maintained the remodeled storefront should be designed to fit inside the original opening and not extend beyond or in front of it key points to consider  the storefront should be composed primarily of glass if transparency is not appropriate consider the use of window treatments such as blinds or drapes  effort should be made to create an inviting entry the entry should be maintained and restored in its original location and configuration if the original entry is gone the new entry should be designed and placed with consideration to traditional design themes and their relationship to the overall building faade and symmetry where appropriate recessed entries are encouraged  transom windows that are covered or blocked should be reopened and restored  storefront bulkheads should be restored or renovated  original elements such as keystones cornices entry doors and lighting fixtures should be restored  signs should be integrated into the storefront design  lighting should be integrated into the storefront design  awnings if appropriate should be integrated into the storefront design the storefront design should be true to the time period in which the building was constructed for example renovating early 20th century buildings with colonial motifs and mansard roofs would be inappropriate when planning the storefront renovation it could be very helpful to contact the horry county historic society for information regarding your building old photographs can be valuable tools in determining original design materials and signs used on your building storefront materials build storefronts out of the best materials  after all their appearance will denote the quality of products and services the customer can expect to find inside when designing a new storefront or renovating an existing one remember the goal should be a transparent faade keeping the materials simple and unobtrusive will help you achieve this goal there is no need to introduce additional types of building materials to those that originally existed whether building new or renovating existing storefronts use materials that perform their intended function well and use them consistently throughout the design utilizing this approach will enable you to achieve simplicity in the design and uniformity in the overall storefront appearance 400 9 utilize existing materials whenever possible repairing rather than replacing typical examples of materials and their location on the storefront include  storefront frame wood cast iron anodized aluminum steel  display windows clear glass  transom windows clear tinted stained or etched glass  entrance wood cast iron or aluminum with a large glass panel  bulkheads recessed wood paneling polished stone glass tile metalclad plywood panels granite marble sandstone pressed metal  storefront cornice wood cast iron pressed metal  side piers should be the same material as the upper faade typically brick or stone when applied thoughtfully and tastefully ornately cast metal columns and trim of intricately molded terra cotta wood or ironwork all contribute to appealing dignified storefronts certain materials should never be used on the traditional commercial building such inappropriate materials may include imitation brick rough textured wood siding wooden shingles on mansard roofs gravel aggregate and vinyl siding these materials have no relationship to the original design themes and therefore violate the consistency of the buildings appearance and the downtown area what to do depending on the buildings condition and the amount of money you have budgeted there are three basic approaches you may want to consider  minimal rehabilitation this preservation approach to rehabilitation requires basic maintenance necessary replacement removal of extraneous materials and simple design improvements cosmetic treatments like covering a timeworn storefront with an awning or painting a contemporary storefront a dark receding color to minimize its effect can help to unify the building  major renovation this approach retains the faades existing original elements while using contemporary and traditional design and materials for replacement of inappropriate elements technology has led to many advancements in construction materials in the years since our downtown was originally built longer lasting synthetic materials are available to replace the more traditional materials of days gone by when selecting your renovation materials whether technologically advanced or traditionally sound choose only those materials high in visual and structural quality in all major renovations care must be taken to insure that the design of improvements is understated so as not to compete with the overall character of the faade for instance when installing a new storefront any of these alternatives would be appropriate  a contemporary design in wood or anodized aluminum  a simplified version of a traditional storefront in wood or aluminum  a traditional period storefront constructed in wood 401 10  restoration this approach restores the faade to its original condition it involves the exact duplication of the original storefront including its architectural detail color scheme and design placement if a building has undergone only minor alterations restoration may be relatively inexpensive and would be most desirable doors the entry to a storefront often can be the focus of a buildings faade maintaining a traditional entry door or pair of doors can contribute to the overall character of the faade traditionally the entrance door was made of wood with a large glass panel every effort should be made to maintain and repair an original door although recessed entries are encouraged take care to make the recessed space feel safe both day and night bright lights and ornamental gates can be effective in this regard if a door is to be replaced consideration should be given to one of the following options  have a new door built with the same design and proportions as the original  find a manufactured wood or steel door that resembles the traditional storefront door  use a standard aluminum commercial door with wide stiles and a dark anodized or baked enamel finish the transparency of the storefront should be carried design of the door avoid doors that are residential in character or decorated with moldings crossbucks or window grills 402 11 signs signs are a vital part of any downtown area providing businesses with identity and providing customers with direction signs also contribute to the overall image of downtown myrtle beach because they are such a visible storefront element signs must be designed selected and utilized appropriately so as not to detract from the faade or from surrounding buildings with a little forethought and careful planning signs can fulfill the business owners needs and enhance the image of downtown myrtle beach placement and number each storefront should be limited to two signs one primary and one secondary the primary sign should be located on the building faade above storefront display windows but below the sills of second floor windows turnofthecentury buildings often used a continuous brick ledge or corbelling to separate the storefront from the upper stories this space is ideal for sign placement as it often was created for this purpose the secondary sign can be a small hanging sign that identifies the business for the pedestrian or a sign painted on a door or display window this sign is generally oriented toward pedestrians a sign in a window should not obscure the display area and shall not occupy more than 25 percent of any vision window the goal is to create a pedestrian oriented downtown where shoppers feel comfortable strolling along the sidewalks and traffic flows at a neighborhood pace therefore it doesnt make a lot of sense to place your signs too high for the pedestrian to easily see by placing the signs at a more human level communication effectiveness will be improved as an added bonus the signs will also be beneath the canopy of shade trees 403 12 size big does not necessarily mean powerful signs should be visually integrated with the storefront to produce a consistent and unified statement about the business within a sign that overpowers the storefront does not communicate a positive image to the customer signs should always be in scale with their surroundings actual size may vary but in general a wall mounted sign or signboard should be no more than 212 feet high or span more than 12 of the building width lettering should be 8 to 18 inches high and occupy between 50 and 65 percent of the signboard lettering and graphics there are hundreds of lettering types available from sign contractors and designers the building owner should select a style that expresses the business message and is compatible with the building and downtown myrtle beach decorative serif and sans serif styles can all be used in the downtown area but should be selected for compatibility with the type of business and type of building in most cases signs should be limited to a maximum of three colors two materials and one lettering style use available information about the colors materials lettering style and placement of the original signs on the building when designing new ones sign colors should compliment the building colors wooden signs with raised letters metal signs painted signs and gold leaf are all appropriate downtown though not for every building nationally distributed or mass produced signs should be avoided  they typically do not express the character of downtown myrtle beach or its unique businesses content signs should express an easytoread direct message keep it simple wording should be minimal limited to the name of the business and if necessary a word or two that expresses its character simple wording is easily read by pedestrians and motorists without creating distraction and clutter a sign that presents more than 10 items of information is lost on its observer count one item of information for each  syllable  symbol graphic or logo  abbreviation  broken plane such as two lines rather than one  discontinuous odd shape 404 13 signs should be used primarily for identifying the business not for subjecting viewers to myriad advertisements lighting illuminated signs may be appropriate downtown if they respect the proportions of the storefront and the other sign design guidelines use lighting that provides a true color rendition the light source should be designed as part of the sign or hidden from view exterior lighting is preferred but be cautious of exposed lights that produce glare and are unpleasant for customers and neighbors unattractive electrical fixtures conduits and wires should be concealed exposed neon letters can be effective adding color and vitality to the street only if it is appropriate to the architecture of the building plastic backlit signs should be avoided tree  sign conflicts signs are the lifeblood of most businesses but so is a friendly inviting shopping environment trees can provide a softened touch to an otherwise harsh downtown area and reduce even the most imposing buildings to human scale and they can do so without interfering with signs trees can be an important way to provide an interesting attractive business environment they do this by giving the area a unified appearance in a place where stores may vary widely in architectural design they also soften hard building materials sidewalks and streets and add color character and seasonal variety and of course they provide cool shade during our hot summers when choosing the design and location of your signs be sure to consider their relation to the sidewalk trees make sure your signs are readable between the trees and below their canopy and remember trees grow so plan for the future design and construction services choose a professional sign maker carefully quality of workmanship and construction is as vital as quality of design ask your neighbors for references and ask the contractor where you can see examples of previous work city in addition to these design guidelines the city of myrtle beach has ordinances that control the size height and placement of signs before investing money in a sign determine whether it will comply with the applicable requirements and restrictions a permit including approval of the community appearance board is required prior to installation of most types of signs please contact the myrtle beach construction services department for sign and awning regulations specific to your zoning district 405 14 awnings & canopies the canvas awning was an important design element in the traditional storefront it provides shelter added color and serves as a transition between the storefront and the upper faade an awning should reinforce the frame of the storefront window but should not cover the piers on either side it should be attached below the sign panel the space between the second story window sills and the first story faade in some cases the awning may be mounted between the transom and the display windows thus allowing light to enter transom while shading pedestrians and merchandise an awning should not be backlit where possible retain and repair awning fixtures and canopies that originate from the buildings earlier historical periods when necessary new awnings should be complementary in placement proportion and color to the buildings original fixtures and to existing awnings and canopies of adjacent buildings new awnings should be constructed of cloth material vinyl plastic and metal are inappropriate to traditional faades and generally detract from the historic character of the area consideration should be given to replacing inappropriate awnings and canopies with traditional canvas fixtures awnings should be regularly maintained rips or tears must be repaired so that the repair is not noticeable from the sidewalk or road if a tear cannot be inconspicuously repaired or if the original awning color changes significantly the awning must be replaced a standard street level awning should be mounted so that the lowest point including any valance is a minimum of nine 9 feet above grade and projects no further than eight 8 feet into the rightofway and no closer than twelve 12 inches from the curb remember that our area is prone to high winds 100 miles per hour is not unusual awning materials should be chosen carefully and should be strong enough to withstand extreme weather conditions metal frames are recommended inappropriate storefront alterations can be effectively disguised by mounting an awning over the alterations while maintaining the proportions of the original storefront 406 15 sidewalks downtown myrtle beach has in place a sidewalk caf  decor ordinance that allows tables chairs and plants to be placed on the sidewalk in front of some downtown storefronts when tastefully designed and cared for the following elements can add to the friendly pedestrian image of downtown myrtle beach  tables and chairs where restaurant patrons can enjoy our beautiful weather with their meal  colorful window boxes hanging from storefront windows  terra cotta pots with small tree and flower arrangements  old fashioned southern rocking chairs where shoppers can sit and relax  park benches where friends can stop for a chat a sidewalk caf  dcor permit is required for all items placed in the rightofway so be sure to apply at the myrtle beach construction services department before investing any money upper stories while storefront design conveys the image of the business occupying the building upper story design conveys the image of the town design elements of upper stories are often ignored leaving the top floors plain and bland dimension should be added to otherwise flat hard surfaces use of some simple design techniques  place window hoods over the upper level windows  place individual awnings over the windows this is particularly effective with arched awnings over arched windows  carry the side pier design from the storefront on upward to the roof this will frame your upper faade the same way it does the lower  place a decorative cornice or parapet along the top edge of the building after all your hard work below your faade should not come to an end with a blank wall meeting a flat roof 407 16 windows windows are an important component of the faade  they open the building with light and offer a proportional continuity between the upper floors and the storefront deteriorated windows have often been covered over inappropriately replaced or simply neglected thereby diminishing the overall character of the building every effort should be made to retain and preserve each original window its function and any decorative details still remaining remove any covering that has been installed over the original windows protect and maintain the wood and metal of the windows and their surroundings with appropriate surface treatments such as cleaning or rust removal all bare wood should be primed with a high quality oilbased primer and painted with one or two coats of latex or oilbased paint a qualified glazier can fix loose or broken windowpanes easily make windows weather tight by recaulking and replacing or installing weather stripping check the overall condition of window materials and window features to determine if repairs are required check all wood parts of the window for decay cracks or splitting pay particular attention to the sills and window sash bottoms where water may collect repair window frames and sashes by patching splicing or reinforcing replace all parts that are deteriorating or missing cracks should be filled with caulk wood putty or epoxy reinforcement and the surface sanded do not replace the entire window when limited replacement of parts is appropriate 408 17 if an original window is missing or deteriorating beyond repair replace the window with one that matches the original use the overall form and any detailing still evident as a guide use the same type of material as the original or a compatible substitute always fill the entire original window opening even if part of the original opening had been previously filled in all window air conditioning units that are visible from the street or sidewalk should be removed air conditioners that drip on the public sidewalk are greatly discouraged rear faade areas behind buildings often are forgotten or neglected customers tend to avoid rear entrances because these areas can be unkempt and unattractive the rears of most buildings are commonly thought of as service areas where deliveries are made or the garbage is picked up however a large percentage of existing and developing parking lots are located adjacent to or abutting these entrance available parking in downtown myrtle beach particularly for superblock businesses is so often located behind buildings that rear or side entrances are warranted the rears of the buildings are coming into full and open view a combination of front entrances with side or rear entrances is called double frontage there are certain advantages to double fronting including  enhanced circulation patterns  better access to offstreet parking  store identity created on more than one side of the building if you dont have an attractive customer friendly rear entrance but are considering improvements ask yourself these questions  where do my customers typically park  would a rear entrance be an added convenience for my customers  what changes would i have to make to my store for an attractive rear entry  how would added walkhelp my business like the storefront the rear entry should respect its neighbors an attempt to make your entrance compatible with surrounding businesses should be a priority look at the back entrances next to yours before you make any changes work with your neighbors to create unity in this alltoooften ignored area 409 18 the rear entry should not compete with the storefront in importance but like the front the back entry requires identification a rear door window panel is one way to identify and open your store to customers a small sign on or near the door is another identifier be sure to keep it small and do not clutter the area with too many signs an awning is a pleasant addition and a convenience to shoppers during inclement weather normal service activities such as trash collection and loading also must occur with ease it is possible to accommodate these functions and make the rear spaces enjoyable people places at the same time pick a central location for trash collection that will serve several stores efficiently simple enclosures can be constructed to hide trash receptacles and to prevent clutter before construction be sure you consult the trash collection agency to ensure that your design will not disrupt pickup services plantings either can add or detract from a rear building area if there is enough sun planter boxes should be utilized as an attractive buffering element remember that plants require care so commit to caring for them properly weeds are a detracting and visually negative element in unattended areas planting ground cover in exposed soil areas can help choke out weeds for a positive image keep all plantings under control and consistently well maintained with good design and proper maintenance rear entrances can become attractive and convenient for shoppers and highly beneficial to downtown myrtle beach colors & paint the placement of colors  rather than the number of colors  best accentuates the architectural details colors are distributed into three categories base trim major and minor and accent the base often matches the natural color of building materials such as brick or stone the major trim color is used to frame the faade doors and windows the major trim color is also the primary color of the cornice and major architectural elements if a minor trim color is used it is often a darker shade placed on doors and window sashes an accent color is used in limited doses to highlight small details colors should tie the architectural elements together the color scheme should be consistent throughout the faades upper and lower portions the colors chosen should be harmonious not only with the colors on your building but also with the colors on neighboring buildings 410 19 historical color scheme this color scheme uses body trim and accent colors from a particular time period historical color schemes are appropriate for the style and character of landmark buildings or buildings located in historic areas the colors should compliment the color schemes on adjacent buildings colors may be chosen based on paint chip analysis of a buildings original color or based on colors used on other buildings of the period color guides of documented historical hues from selected paint manufacturers are an aid in historical color selection old photos of the building or a similar one can establish light verses dark color placement boutique color scheme this nonhistorical color scheme uses bright trim and accent colors in dramatic contrast to the base color of a building a building must have an extremely ornate architecture to pick out details successfully with multiple accent colors so use this color scheme cautiously too many colors on the wrong elements will detract from the buildings character and that of its neighbors taken to an extreme boutique color schemes can create a building that looks as though a carnival is taking place inside playful exaggerated color schemes and architectural themes can work well in an urban downtown only if carried area as large as one block or more a wild art deco design may look great in an entire district but would look silly on a single building sandwiched between two mediterranean faades surface preparation proper surface preparation of wood metal and masonry prior to repainting will maximize the longevity of the topcoat the following steps will help prevent premature paint failure  thoroughly remove dirt mildew and paint chalk with a mild detergent  remove failing paint on wood with electric heat scraping or sanding  remove failing paint on metal or masonry with an approved chemical application never sandblast sandblasting high pressure washes or other abrasive paint removal methods should never be undertaken welldocumented evidence shows that these bad design > 411 20 methods do irreversible damage to wood and masonry surfaces sandblasting removes the hard glazed surface from kiln fired masonry and exposes thinner more porous material to water infiltration and accelerates deterioration sandblasting also severely pits the surfaces of masonry and wood and opens wood grain to moisture dirt and mildew infiltration significant architectural elements should be retained repaired or preserved whenever possible as a last resort damaged material should be replaced with similar matching material only weathered and cracked wood should be treated with consolidates preservatives and  or filters then sanded prior to sealing painting the purpose of paint is to seal the building surface against the elements and to prevent deterioration of materials from temperature and humidity extremes generally wall surfaces that have not been painted such as brick terra cotta stone and cast concrete should remain unpainted soft porous brick that was originally painted should remain painted always select paint that is formulated for the particular surface application planned a primer coat seals the surface and enhances the bond with the comparable topcoats on unsealed wood and metal surfaces use oil or alkyd primers unsealed masonry requires a specialized primer  sealer when repainting over an existing topcoat continue to use the same paint formulation  oil or latex if a formula change is necessary or if the original paint type cannot be determined then prime with a first coat specifically made for the topcoat planned finally apply two topcoats to provide the most durable finish masonry many buildings in downtown myrtle beach consist of brick masonry some structures also consist of stone concrete block and marble masonry is a strong durable building material and when well maintained can last for centuries masonry cleaning and repointing are two very common methods of masonry repair while both may improve the appearance of a building care must be taken to determine the proper techniques used so that no harm is done to the masonry masonry cleaning first of all it should not be assumed that all masonry needs cleaning surface stains generally cause few problems and can even enhance the charm of an older building however evidence may indicate that heavy dirt and other pollutants are actually harming the masonry it is reasonable to clean masonry where it is necessary to halt deterioration or to remove unsightly and heavy soiling but take care not to destroy the natural characteristics that come with age 412 21 some questions to consider  how clean does the surface need to be  what is the nature of the soil and how tightly is it adhering to the surface  what is the masonry type and what are its characteristics  how is the surface constructed are there any metal attachments that could rust  how can the environment as well as peoples health best be protected during the cleaning select the gentlest cleaning method possible to achieve an acceptable level of cleanliness work with a professional to help ensure that the method chosen is right for your building 2 acceptable cleaning methods  water this method ranges from hand scrubbing to pressure washing to steam cleaning it softens and rinses dirt deposits from the surface water cleaning generally is the simplest gentlest safest and least expensive method of masonry cleaning  chemical chemical cleaners include acidic alkaline or organic compounds in either liquid or vapor forms the chemical reacts with the dirt and  or the masonry to hasten the dirt removal process be careful when used improperly chemical runoff can cause serious damage to the environment including plants animals and waterways generally it is better to clean the masonry with the gentlest method possible check with the sc department of health and environmental control dhec before using any chemical cleansers to select the best cleaning technique perform a patch test observe the results for a sufficient time period all four seasons if possible to determine the immediate and longrange effects of the cleaning method abrasives including grit blasting grinders or sanding disks can cause great damage to masonry surfaces and are inappropriate ways to clean old masonry repointing repointing is the removal of deteriorating or failing mortar from masonry joints and replacing it with new mortar repointing can restore the visual and physical integrity of the masonry generally it is better to clean the masonry before resorting to repointing unless the mortar is badly eroded some obvious signs of deterioration may include  disintegration of mortar  cracks in mortar joints  loose bricks cornice sections or decorative elements 413 22 as a general rule only repoint where there is deterioration repointing should only be done by an experienced professional if you decide to repoint consider the following  duplicate the original mortar in strength composition color and texture  rake the joint carefully to an even face and uniform depth preferably with the use of hand tools  duplicate old mortar joints in width and profile professional assistance wow there sure is a lot to think about and each design element be it the entry door or a second story window is as important as the others the renovations you make are not just improvements to your building  they are also improvements to your business and to your neighborhood creating a thorough design plan can seem overwhelming especially if youve never done one before remember this is an investment in your future and in your community never under estimate the value of hiring a design professional 414 23 new construction the construction of new buildings on vacant lots is encouraged the design of a new downtown building is a special challenge its front faade should be designed to be compatible with the surrounding buildings the appearance of a new building must always be sensitive to the character of its neighbors without mimicking them there are several factors that will govern the visual relationship between a new building and its neighbors building placement buildings in downtown myrtle beach should be constructed parallel to streets and in close relationship to the street frontage the new faade should be flush to its neighbors faades unless a restaurant use is planned in the case of restaurant construction it is encouraged that the faade be set back so as to provide an outdoor eating area that extends to the front lot line 415 24 mixeduse retail and office buildings should abut the sidewalks on at least one side and orient the primary entrance or entrances toward the street pedestrian access to and on the site is a primary issue harmonious design and functionality should be provided relative to uses on the site and on adjacent rightsofway and private properties aspects of design to be considered include  handicapped access  pavement material  landscaping  lighting  seating dimensions when downtown myrtle beach was first constructed main street and kings highway were dirt roads back then the roads were narrower and the surrounding building heights provided a comfortable human scale over the years these roads have been widened while the building heights remained the same as a result the current downtown views have a hard feeling more appropriate for a highway than a downtown for this reason new buildings taller than one story are encouraged however very tall building faades can create a canyon effect on the sidewalk below to avoid this the vertical plane of a faade should not exceed 36 feet in height above that the upper stories should be set back a minimum of five feet from the lower faade the first three floors should be distinguished from the remainder of the building with an emphasis on design elements that will enhance the pedestrian environment elements that add special interest include  cornices  belt courses  corbelling  molding  stringcourses  ornamentation  changes in material or color 416 25 special attention should be given to the design of windows on the first three floors recessed windows that are distinguished from the shaft of the building are encouraged this can be achieved use of  arches  pediments  mullions the width of the surrounding buildings determines the general width for a new structure the new building should occupy the entire space and reflect the characteristic rhythm of faades along the street if the site is large the mass of the faade should be broken into a number of small bays to maintain a rhythm with the surrounding buildings the original downtown lot widths provide a natural guide for the width of each bay see sketch below special provisions for buildings in focal point locations focal points include corner locations and lots located at the termination of a street or where a street changes direction particular care should be given to the design of all faades of buildings in these prominent locations garage doors service entrances and unornamented walls should not be placed in highly visible locations in general buildings at focal point locations should also be taller than surrounding structures and focal point locations at the center of a continuous faade should be taller than adjacent portions of the rest of the building when planned with good design and taste corner buildings that are taller and have larger features can break up the monotony of a long straight sidewalk and give the streetscape a more human scale 417 26 composition the composition of the new faade  that is the organization of its parts  should be similar to that of surrounding faades rhythms that carry block such as window spacing should be incorporated into the new faade proportions of the openings the size and proportion of window or door openings of a new building should be similar to those on surrounding faades the same applies to the ratio of window area to solid wall for the faade as a whole rhythms that carry throughout the block such as window spacing should be incorporated into the new faade doorways should be recessed into the face of the building to provide a sense of entry and to add variety to the streetscape the entryway should be 1 square foot for each 1000 square feet of floor area with a minimum of 15 square feet pedestrian movement is very important to the success of downtown myrtle beach although people love to window shop on a beautiful day most are unwilling to walk long distances between stores in fact various studies have shown that shoppers will stop in their tracks and turn around if they cannot easily see the next storefront for that reason long blank walls are greatly discouraged in downtown myrtle beach where expanses of solid wall are necessary they should not exceed 20 feet in length the use of transparent windows and doors at the street level helps create interest detailing of street walls with awnings and a variation of building materials adds to this interest multiple entrances from the public sidewalk or open spaces are encouraged 418 27 structured parking facilities should be designed so that the only garage openings at the street level are those to accommodate vehicle entrances and pedestrian access the remainder of the street level frontage should be occupied retail or office space if neither of those options is conducive to your location then an architecturally articulated faade should be designed to screen the parking area of the structure and to encourage pedestrian activity detailing new architecture should reflect the elements and detailing of surrounding buildings emphasize the quality of detail and special form in  window shapes  cornice lines  brick work  window treatments  columns  eaves in the upper stories of structures over four stories a variety of shapes angles and reliefs are encouraged materials a new faade should be composed of materials similar to those in adjacent faades the new building should not stand in opposition to the others buildings should be constructed of materials that minimize light reflection and glare appropriate materials include  brick  stucco  smooth finished concrete  architectural metals 419 28 color the colors chosen for a new faade should relate to those on neighboring buildings care should be taken to avoid clashing colors on individual buildings and between adjacent buildings roof forms the type of roof used should be similar to those found on adjacent buildings the roofline of buildings should be modulated to avoid large areas of flat roof and should include interesting architectural features preferably the upper cornice will cover the visibility of a flat roof from the front faade consideration should be given to the appearance from taller buildings nearby rooftop mechanical equipment and satellite dish antennas should be screened in a manner that enhances the overall architectural design rooftops should be of a color that reduces glare rooftop terraces and gardens are encouraged  what a wonderful amenity to a residential apartment or downtown restaurant refer to sketch on  paving a paving element in the public space can be repeated in the private space in order to give continuity and transition however the paving systems used in private plazas and walkways may be different in color material and texture from those in the public rightofway a contrasting pattern with more detail such as brick granite or similar material offers a unifying element for the plaza or walkway the contrasting pattern establishes the private boundaries and gives the space an overall pedestrian scale bad design > 420 29 the transition between public and private spaces offers a tremendous opportunity to establish a sense of arrival establish a particular developments unique character and add an overall liveliness and variety to the pedestrian environment vehicular areas vehicular access to and on sites should be designated to minimize interference with pedestrian access and with traffic flow on abutting streets driveup windows are discouraged the number of access points should be kept to the minimum necessary to prevent

false sense of historical development such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings shall not be undertaken 4 most properties change over time  those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved 5 distinctive features finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved 6 deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature the new feature shall match the old in design 7 chemical or physical treatments such as sandblasting that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used the surface cleaning of structures if appropriate shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible 8 significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved if such resources must be disturbed mitigation
