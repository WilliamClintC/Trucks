are strongly encouraged c mechanical equipment should be concealed from public streets within the volume of the roof or enclosed within penthouse structures or screening that will substantially eliminate visibility of the equipment from public streets 3 facades a front facades should be architecturally emphasized entrance treatments and details architectural elements such as doorways dormers
