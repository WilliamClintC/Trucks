procedures set forth in subsections a1 and a2 of this section a copy of the observers certification shall accompany the vision emission evaluation vee 1time averaged opacity method this procedure is used for continuous fugitive dust emission sources such as earthmoving grading and trenching that produce emissions continuously the certified observer should do the following aposition stand at a position at least twenty feet 20 from the fugitive dust source in order to provide a clear view of the emissions with the sun oriented in the one hundred forty degree 140 sector to the back consistent as much as possible with maintaining the above requirements make opacity observations from a position such that the line of sight is approximately perpendicular to the plume and wind direction the observer may follow the fugitive dust plume generated by mobile earthmoving equipment as long as the sun remains oriented in the one hundred forty degree 140 sector to the back as much as possible do not include more than one plume in the line of sight at one time bfield records record the name of the site fugitive dust source type eg earthmoving grading trenching method of control used if any observers name certification data and affiliation and a sketch of the observers position relative to the fugitive dust source and respective sun location also record the time estimated distance to the fugitive dust source location approximate wind direction estimated wind speed description of the sky condition presence and color of clouds and observers position relative to the fugitive dust source and color of the plume and type of background on the visible emission observation when opacity readings are initiated and completed cobservations make opacity observations to the extent possible using a contrasting background that is perpendicular to the line of sight make opacity observations at a point just beyond where material is no longer being deposited out of the plume normally three 3 feet above the surface from which the plume is generated the initial observation should begin immediately after a plume has been created above the surface involved do not look continuously at the plume but instead observe the plume momentarily at fifteen 15 second intervals for fugitive dust from earthmoving equipment make opacity observations at a point just beyond where material is not being deposited out of a plume normally three 3 feet above the mechanical equipment generating the plume drecording observations  record the opacity observations to the nearest five percent 5% every fifteen 15 seconds on a vee record sheet each momentary observation recorded represents the average opacity of emission for a fifteen 15 second period if a multiple plume exists at the time of an observation do not record an opacity reading mark an x for that reading if the equipment generating the plume travels outside of the field of observation resulting in the inability to maintain the orientation of the sun within the one hundred forty degree 140 sector or if the equipment ceases operating mark an x for the fifteen 15 second interval reading readings identified as x shall be considered interrupted readings edata reduction for time averaged method opacity observations of emissions from stationary sources shall be conducted in accordance with epa method 9 2intermittent emissions method this procedure is for evaluating intermittent fugitive dust emissions intermittent fugitive dust sources include activities that produce emissions intermittently such as screening dumping and stockpiling where predominant emissions are produced intermittently aposition see subsection a1a of this section bfield records see subsection a1b of this section copacity observations opacity observations shall use procedures similar to method 9 but the requirement for observation to be made at fifteen 15 second intervals over a six 6 minute period shall not apply  4913 informational sign requirements aany

maintenance construction and occupancy of the property 1standards all improvements to landmark sites shall be in accord with the general and specific standards for historic preservation as prepared by the secretary of the interior and in harmony with the architectural character of the neighborhood 2additions whenever possible new additions or adaptive reuse to structures shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or changes were to be removed in the future the essential form and integrity of the structure would not be impaired 3parking and access offstreet parking loading facilities and pedestrian access shall be designed so as not to create conflicting movement all other areas other than driveways parking areas walks and terraces shall be appropriately landscaped and provided with appropriate trees and shrubbery 4accessory structures accessory structures shall be improved to harmonize with any redevelopment of the primary structure 5restoration of exterior faades restoration of all exterior faades including the side and rear faade shall be in keeping with the objectives herein roofline windows and exterior facing materials shall all be considered adjoining buildings in separate or the same ownership shall be rehabilitated so as to carry out a unified concept 6harmony of materials techniques and colors materials techniques and colors must conform to and harmonize with original materials and techniques to this end the emphasis should be where practical on correct period sash doors cornices wall materials and signs and the removal of presentday anachronisms such as defacing or outofscale contemporary features the general requirements shall apply particularly to visible surfaces on the exterior new work adjoining old must be carefully blended to minimize the separation unless in the opinion of qualified architectural experts it is better to make the joining areas obvious and thereby emphasize the qualities of the original work 7patching when repairing or replacing masonry details decorations or parapet walls care should be taken to prevent an obvious and unsightly patch materials joints etc should match the original as closely as possible in composition color and texture for additional information on repairing masonry walls see the preservation brief no 2 prepared by the technical preservation services division of the united states department of the interior 8fake details and decorations fake historic details decorations and other additions should be avoided 9anchoring sagging details decorations cornices string courses lintels arches pilasters and parapet walls should be firmly reanchored the original height of the parapet wall should not be modified 10repair or replacement of architectural details deteriorated building details should be repaired rather than replaced whenever possible repair or replacement of missing architectural decorations and details should be based on accurate duplications substantiated by historical physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural design in the event replacement is necessary the new material should match the original material in composition design color and texture 11painting heavy or numerous coats of paint or paint in the wrong color that obscures architectural decorations and details should be removed before repainting refer to preservation brief no 10 exterior paint problems on historic woodwork by the technical preservation services division of the united states department of the interior 12fixtures hardware and lighting fixtures where practical shall be selected with care to conform to authentic work of the period and to match remaining originals where such exist 13ornaments if the original or significant detail no longer exists or is too deteriorated to save it is recommended that a contemporary design be undertaken which is compatible with the rest of the building in scale design materials color and texture an alternative might be to undertake an accurate restoration based on historical research and physical evidence where an original or significant detail no longer exists and no evidence exists to document its early appearance it is generally preferable to undertake a contemporary detail that retains the historic flavor of the building 14materials aoriginal building wall material should not be covered with any form of inappropriate siding where this has already occurred the inappropriate siding should be removed and the original wall material restored  bmasonry facings shall be cleaned and painted as necessary sandblasting is forbidden without prior approval of the historic preservation commission all repointing when necessary shall be done according to the specifications set by preservation brief no 2 repointing mortar joints in historic brick buildings by the heritage conservation and recreation service united states department of the interior  crecommended materials for rehabilitation of masonry buildings include traditional bond pattern such as running bond or flemish bond not stack bond clay facing tile may be used if the face size of the tile is that of standard brick and if the bond pattern is typical of contributing buildings in the neighborhood  dthe imitation of stone veneer or brick using stucco prefabricated plastic plywood andor fiber panels is not acceptable unless documented or pictorial evidence  easphalt or wood shingled awnings and diagonal sided panels are not acceptable  fvinyl or aluminum panels imitating clapboard or wood siding are not acceptable  gglazing shall be clear nonreflective and untinted doubleglazed insulating glass or materials such as acrylic or highimpact polycarbonate panels are permissible  hwall surfaces that have not been painted should remain unpainted 15color acolor for all rehabilitation work must blend with the existing exterior residential color palette if any new brick is used for rehabilitation work it must be similar in texture effect and color to the original brick stucco color for exterior walls shall be similar in tone to the muted pastels typical of historic pioneer stucco buildings or shall blend with the natural tones of the surrounding geology reflected on the exterior of adjacent buildings  bwhite and offwhite may be used on decorative elements such as lintels sills and cornices bright colors are not appropriate for major architectural elements such as building walls however when used sparingly in fine lines such as on the wood trim of a storefront a brighter color than that of the building face will be allowed to enhance a particular color scheme  cmetallic finishes generally are not allowed except when used in such treatments as paintedgold or bronzetoned lettering on storefront glass  da simple color scheme of up to no more than three 3 exterior colors is required 16mechanical equipment aradio television telephone andor other telecommunication equipment such as antennas or satellite dishes and ancillary systems cables junction boxes and the like shall be placed behind or within suitable visual barriers in such a way that it is not visible from the streets  bheating and air conditioning equipment including cooling units blowers exhaust fans ducts andor ancillary systems support units brackets wiring junction boxes and the like shall be properly screened or installed behind or within suitable visual barriers 17new construction the guidelines in this section are to be used by those planning new construction their purpose is to reinforce and enhance the historic architectural character of the neighborhood by encouraging compatible new construction the guidelines do this by describing and illustrating certain design concepts found in the historic architecture of the neighborhood  concepts which can be applied in the design of new structures 18considerations the historic preservation commission will consider design concepts other than those recommended in these guidelines when necessary to promote design concepts found in the historic architecture of the neighborhood however in order for a design to be considered for exceptional review it must not include the use of elements that are designated as inappropriate in the guidelines 19siting the ground floor of new structures should relate to the pedestrians human scale and continue to display the siting of neighboring structures 20scale aof the many criteria that must be considered when designing new buildings for the neighborhood by far the most important is the scale of the new building and its relationship to the scale of the neighborhood  bjust as the relationship of a new structure to the buildings on its block is important so is it important that the elements within its faade be appropriately scaled the scale of these elements should recall those of neighboring structures 21width of building building widths have a major impact upon the perception of the scale of a building the apparent widths of the front faades of new buildings should correspond to typical widths of the buildings on the same block a long faade should be broken into separate elements to suggest faade widths or bays similar to those of neighboring buildings 22windows original windows in the older buildings are predominantly wood doublehung type a sash pattern of one over one 11 that is one 1 undivided framed pane above a similar pane is the most common type in new construction one over one 11 type is required unless the majority of windows in adjacent structures facing the streetscape clearly indicates otherwise the pattern of a one over one 11 window may be achieved by the use of fixed glass with three 3 conditions athe window frame replicates the proportions of a typical doublehung window sash  bno unpainted clear aluminum is used for the frame  and cthe window frame is of similar crosssectional size to that of doublehung windows typical of the neighborhood 23ornament the ornamental details shall be compatible and in scale with those used in the streetscape 24color approved color schemes appropriate for the neighborhood are required amuted background colors are required for the majority of the building surfaces  bup to two 2 complementary accent colors may be used in addition to the background color  cfinished wood surfaces the rustic or bare wood look is not allowed  dthe natural color of stone or brick may not be painted  eroofs must be a neutral or muted brown or gray  1013e2 arts district sign regulations within the citys arts district the citys
