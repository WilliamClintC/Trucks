the quantity and quality of sewage discharged into the sewage system the quantity of sewage shall be measured by meter weir or other measuring device approved by the utilities manager and installed by the industry or user at its own expense the quality of sewage shall be measured by the pounds of suspended solids and the pounds of biochemical oxygen demand bod contained therein the determination of suspended solids and bod contained in the waste shall be in accordance with guidelines approved by the epa and dnr establishing test procedures for the analysis of pollutants to determine the quality of the sewage and waste samplings and analyses of twentyfour 24 composite samples shall be made daily by and at the expense of the industry or user and accumulated over the billing period the city

office of the city clerk b the city shall determine the strength of normal domestic waste from its nonmonitored customers by subtracting the industrial monitored loading by parameter from the total loading treated by the city the net pounds of biochemical oxygen demand bod and total suspended solids from the nonmonitored customers shall be divided by 834 a conversion factor and then divided by the net billable flow expressed in millions of gallons from those nonmonitored customers to determine whether the strength of the waste is within a reasonable range for a normal domestic household the city will consider normal domestic strength waste to have a bod concentration of not more than three hundred 300 milligrams per liter should this calculation for bod be higher than three hundred 300 milligrams per liter a review will be done of the city users to determine if there are additional users that should be monitored for high strength water this methodology shall be followed to assure that the charges are proportionately made to all customers no users shall pay less per one thousand 1000 gallons than the current effective rate associated with the per unit costs for environmental treatment based on the waste characteristics determined to be applicable for domestic or industrial users 113         92      2500 exceptions and modifications of charges in cases where there is no water meter or acceptable water consumption record the quantity of water used shall be determined in such reasonable and accurate manner as the utilities manager may direct and the charge shall be computed if any building discharging sanitary sewage industrial wastes water and other liquid directly or indirectly into the public sanitary sewerage system can show to the satisfaction of the utilities manager that a portion of the water used does not and cannot enter the public sanitary sewage system the city may determine by a reasonable and accurate method the amount of the water used or the percentage of water entering the public sanitary sewage system chargeable to such owner or user such amount or percentage when so determined shall then constitute the basis of sewer service
