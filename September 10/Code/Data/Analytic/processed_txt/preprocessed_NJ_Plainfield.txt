disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored causes damage in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss 3 statement of purpose it is the purpose of

lines streets bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  g to insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions 4 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this section includes methods and provisions for a restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  d controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e preventing or regulating the

regulations control soil erosion and runoff for areas of disturbance in excess of five thousand 5000 square feet much of the development in the city occurs on small lots with less substantial areas of disturbance soil movement has therefore been uncontrolled this has resulted in soil runoff onto properties adjacent to construction muddy streets and blocked public ways the introduction of soil

inverts of the principal outlets used to control the larger storms for flood control purposes should be set at the elevation of the water surface elevation required to produce the water quality storage volume therefore the principal outlets would be utilized  1  1  for storms in excess of the one and twentyfivehundredthsinch twohour event which in turn would be completely controlled by the lower three 3 inch outlet if the above requirements would result in a pipe smaller than three 3 inches in diameter the period of retention shall be waived so that three 3 inches will be the minimum pipe size used it should be remembered that in all cases the basin should be considered initially empty ie the storage provided for the quality requirements and the discharge capacity of its outlet
