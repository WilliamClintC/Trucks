coronary heart disease and lung cancer  4 there is no riskfree level of exposure to secondhand smoke  5 establishing smokefree workplaces is the only effective way to ensure that secondhand smoke

hightech smoking devices commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes or ecigarettes closely resemble and purposefully mimic the act of smoking by having users inhale vaporized liquid nicotine created by heat electronic ignition system after testing a number of electronic cigarettes from two leading manufacturers the food and drug administration fda determined that various samples tested contained not only nicotine but also detectable levels of known carcinogens and toxic chemicals including tobaccospecific nitrosamines and diethyl glycol a toxic chemical used in antifreeze the fdas testing also suggested that quality control processes used to manufacture these products are inconsistent or nonexistent according to a more recent study electronic cigarette emissions are made up of a high concentration of ultrafine particles and the particle concentration is higher than in conventional tobacco cigarette smoke electronic cigarettes produce an aerosol or vapor of undetermined and potentially harmful substances which may appear similar to the smoke emitted by traditional tobacco products their use in workplaces and public places where smoking of traditional tobacco products is prohibited creates concern and confusion and leads to difficulties in enforcing the smoking prohibitions the world health organization who recommends that electronic smoking devices not be used
