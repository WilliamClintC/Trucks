article i general provisions  1551 short title this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the economy borough stormwater management   1552 statement of findings the governing body of the municipality finds that a stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens public health and safety by causing decreased infiltration of rainwater and increased runoff flows and velocities which overtax the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers and greatly increases the cost to the public to manage stormwater b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c a program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of land development and redevelopment causing loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater f federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes g nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the municipality  1551 stormwater management

management c utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems as much as possible d manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source which requires a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes e focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources f maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses g meet legal water quality requirements under state law including regulations at 235 pa 4a to protect and maintain existing uses and maintain the level of water quality to support those uses in all streams and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection streams h prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and
