authorization findings and purpose astatutory authorization the legislature of the state has in gs   gs parts 3 5 and 8  and gs delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare therefore the board of aldermen of the town does ordain as follows bfindings of fact 1the floodprone areas within the jurisdiction of the town are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in floodprone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards cstatement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within floodprone areas by provisions designed to 1restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  2require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve the uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4control filling grading dredging and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands dobjectives the objectives of this chapter are to 1protect human life safety and health  2minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions  5minimize damage to public facilities and utilities ie water and gas mains electric telephone cable and sewer lines streets and bridges that are located in floodprone areas  6help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas  and 7ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area   15102 definitions for the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly

aintroduction the purpose of this section is to allow for the usage of density credits in association with the dedication of road rightofway the thoroughfare plan of the gaston urban area shows the location of existing and proposed thoroughfares in the dallas area per gs  1366610 dedication of rightof way in conformance with the thoroughfare plan may be required by a local government in association with such dedication gs  1366610 also permits local elected bodies to grant density credits such rightofway dedication and the allowance of density credits is viewed as a means of fostering the orderly timely and costeffective development andor improvement of thoroughfares in the dallas area bdefinitions 1for purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning density credit the potential for the improvement or subdivision of part or all of a parcel of real property as permitted under the terms of this chapter functional design a preliminary roadway design shall be approved by the board of aldermen on a topographic map at a scale no smaller than one inch equals 200 feet 1   200 showing the horizontal width centerline and typical crosssection for a proposed roadway crosssections shall show roadway and lane width and rightofway width and may also show utility easements and other roadway improvements that describe the final appearance of the road ie sidewalks tree plantings bikeway facilities etc typical crosssections should be based on ncdot recommended street designs all functional designs are maintained at the metropolitan planning office facilities located in the gastonia city hall and are available for public inspection during normal business hours thoroughfare plan the version of the thoroughfare plan of the gaston urban area most recently adopted by the board of aldermen 2the following terms are to be used in computing and applying density credits a1   entire area of land to be dedicated for thoroughfare rightofway purposes if direct access to such thoroughfare by abutting lots from the tract in question is not permitted a2   lf direct access from abutting lots on the tract in question to the thoroughfare is allowed the difference between the area of land dedicated for rightofway purposes b   area of tract prior to rightofway dedication c   a a1 of a2 ie land in tract remaining after dedication is made d   minimum lot size requirement prior to application of density credit bonus e   minimum lot size after application of density credit bonus a1 or a2b x d f   maximum multifamily units per acre without density credit bonus crightofway dedication 1per gs  1366610 density credits may be granted by the board of aldermen whenever rightofway dedication in accordance with the thoroughfare plan is required for a tract of land located within the planning jurisdiction of the town and such tract is proposed for subdivision or use of land pursuant to a zoning permit 2rightofway dedication may be so required by the board of aldermen in situations where land subdivision is not involved if the board of aldermen determines that asaid dedication does not result in the deprivation of all reasonable use of the original tract  and bthe dedication is reasonably related to the traffic generated by the proposed use of land or the impact of the dedication is mitigated by other measures including the use of density credits as herein prescribed on contiguous land owned by the subdivider 3aif the full width of the thoroughfare for which land is to be dedicated is completely contained within the tract of land to be used or developed up to 100% of the rightofway needed to construct or enlarge the thoroughfare on that tract shall be provided bif a portion of such thoroughfare is located on the property proposed to be subdivided or developed the corresponding proportion of land on that tract may be required to be dedicated 4dedication of land as provided herein shall be offered to the public proof in the form of an instrument having been recorded in the gaston county deeds office of such dedication having been made shall be furnished to the zoning enforcement officer prior to the issuance of any zoning permit 5any land so dedicated shall substantially be that as needed for the thoroughfare rightofway in question as shown on the thoroughfare plan dapplication of density credits 1the usage of density credits shall be applicable on a particular tract only if approved by the board of aldermen 2the amount of density credits granted by the board of aldermen shall be computed as follows aif the tracts which abuts the proposed thoroughfare or lots created from said tract which abut the thoroughfare will be able to directly access the thoroughfare density credits will be computed only for that area of land dedicated per the thoroughfare plan irrespective of the above the board of aldermen shall have the authority to issue density credits based on the full rightofway width having determined that the proposed road location will significantly aid in the flow of traffic both in the immediate vicinity and throughout the community bif the tracts which abuts the proposed thoroughfare or lots created from said tract which abut the thoroughfare are not permitted access or are otherwise unable to access the thoroughfare density credits are to be calculated using the fullwidth of the rightofway dedication area 3the result of the application of density credits shall be to allow for a level or intensity of development above that which would normally be allowed in the underlying general zoning district and the creation of lots which may be smaller in area that otherwise called for in the underlying zoning district edensity credit calculations the following formulae shall be used in calculating the additional amount of development allowed using density credits 1singlefamily including lots containing individual manufactured homes and twofamily lots athe density credit bonus is derived by dividing the area dedicated for thoroughfare rightof way purposes a1 or a2 by the area of the entire tract and then multiplied by 100 a1 or a2b x 100 the ensuing figure may be used on a percentbypercent basis to reduce the minimum lot size by up to 25% irrespective of the use of density credits all yard height parking and setback requirements as stated in this chapter are to be observed badditionally all lots will either utilize a well andor septic system or are located within the watershed district must meet the minimum lot area maximum density and other standards prescribed by the gaston county environmental health division or the gaston county watershed administrator refer to figure 1 for an illustrative example figure 1 subdivision note drawing not to scale facts 1the tract has an area of 871200 square feet 20 acres 2the area of the thoroughfare right ofway   100 000 square feet

the tracts area is taken up by the proposed thoroughfare rightofway access from the subdivision lots to the thoroughfare shall not be permitted thus the full density credit 100000871200 or  is applicable the full density credit  is below the maximum allowable 025 thus minimum lot sizes can be reduced by 115% 2twofamily developments and any other developments where density is measured on a units per acre basis athe density credit bonus a1 or a2b shall be multiplied by the maximum density level f in the underlying zoning district the resulting figure is then added to f and then multiplied by c the remaining developable land in the tract once the rightofway dedication has been made in no case may the subsequent density level be raised by more than 25% over that level which is normally allowed in the underlying zoning district irrespective of the use of density credits all yard height parking and setback requirements stated in this chapter are to be observed badditionally all lots that will either utilize a well andor septic system or are located within the watershed district must meet the minimum lot area maximum density and other standards prescribed by the gaston

access from the development to thoroughfare is permitted thus half of the rightofway 50000 square feet is available for the density credit bonus thus 50000871200    normal zoning requires this building to have 200 offstreet parking spaces the available density credit 50000 square feet can be used to reduce the number of parking spaces by up to 20 ie 10% use of the full available density credit will not be made the developer may wish to build a larger building to make full use of the density credits    planned residential developments apurpose and intent 1planned residential

principal building and ten feet to any other principal or accessory structure within the development 14common open space common open space is only that land dedicated to the public or designated by the development plan for the use benefit and enjoyment of all residents of the planned development open space may be common area owned and maintained by a homeowners association or open space dedicated to the public the city of gastonia will only except open space when it is part of a larger public recreation system such as land along a planned greenway route and maintains sole discretion on property acceptance to qualify as common open space the land shall be usable for recreation purposes or provide visual aesthetic or environmental amenities and may not be occupied by streets drives parking areas or structures other than recreational structures with the exception of a sidewalk with at least a sixfoot wide tree lawn a1twenty percent of the project area shall consist of common open space common open space may be a combination of usable natural areas such as community greens or passive park space and improved common open space such as pedestrian trails pool and club house areas tennis courts playgrounds and sidewalks when a sixfoot wide minimum tree lawn is provided between the sidewalk and the street a minimum of 12% of the project area shall consist of improved common open space 2if additional improved common open space is provided the total common open space required may be reduced as follows  improved common open space provided total common open space required 13% 19% 14% 18% 15% 17% 16% 16%  bbecause space is limited within transitional infill developments tids the common open space requirements are reduced at least 12% of the project area shall consist of common open space and a minimum of 8% shall be improved common open space transitional infill developments tids within the traditional design td overlay district having less than six dwelling units are exempt from the common open space requirements csidewalks constructed in conjunction with a sixfoot wide tree lawn may be counted towards improved common open space however sidewalks and tree lawns may only account for up to 50% of the projects common improved open space calculation for example if 150000 square feet of common improved open space is required and 230000 square feet is attributable to sidewalks with tree lawns then 325000 square feet may be applied toward improved common open space and 45000 square feet may be applied toward usable natural areas trees should be planted in a way that minimizes conflict with underground utilities denvironmentally sensitive lands land within a floodway or floodway fringe as determined by fema land with slopes greater than 25% wetlands and other critical ecological areas shall not qualify as common open space however an exception may be made when based on staff evaluation recreation areas and trails are provided within these lands in a manner that doesnt overly impact sensitive areas eall property owners in the prd shall have access to the open space by means of a public or private street or an allweather walkway in a publicly dedicated easement fwhen improvements are made for recreational purposes standard practices for long term durability and minimal maintenance should be observed gopen space shall be provided within each phase of the prd in sufficient amounts to serve a substantial portion of the expected population or occupancy of that phase hif private walking or nature trails are proposed said improved common open space shall be calculated as follows  trail width calculation 4 to 611 length of trail x 50 + width of trail   improved area over 7 length of trail x 100 + width of trail   improved space if any land within the calculated area is not unobstructed open space said areas shall be subtracted from this calculation in addition any area may only be used in determining the improved common open space calculation  ifor planned unit developments puds the percentage of open space shall be calculated based on the total acreage of residential and institutional uses only contributing improved open spaces within office and commercial areas can be counted towards the total open space calculation 15screening screening in accordance with sections 17144 and 17145 shall be required at the following locations aalong a property line or a street bounding the project where said property line or street separates the project from other uses the following screening shall be provided 1if the prd abuts an office o

specifications shall be placed on both sides of major and minor thoroughfares on streets other than thoroughfares the construction of sidewalks on both sides of the street is encouraged however at a minimum sidewalks are required along one side of internal streets due to the size ie number of residences proposed of the development and the associated internal road traffic network for the development the planning commission andor city council may require the placement of sidewalks in other situations where it is deemed to support the publics interest and general welfare 19additional

project in four phases each phase containing 25 units the maximum density allowed in each phase shall be ten units per acre ba 60 unit development is proposed to be developed in three phases the maximum allowable density for the project is ten units per acre phase one is developed at a density of five units per acre phase two may be developed at a maximum density of 15 units per acre in this manner the cumulative density of the project is not greater than the maximum allowed of ten units per acre in no instance may the cumulative density at any time exceed ten units per acre 21lot line

development tnd is a type of planned unit development pud  provided however if it contains only residential land uses and other nonresidential uses typically allowed by right in the applicable residential district it may be deemed a type of planned residential development prd most tnds will require a rezoning to the pudcud district a tnd that can meet the requirements for prd within the applicable zoning district may be approved as a prd by the conditional use permit hearing process no rezoning required all other tnds will require rezoning to the pudcud district and the granting of a conditional use permit a traditional neighborhood development is a development that substantially meets the guiding principles of traditional neighborhood development design as set forth in this section apurpose and intent the purpose and intent of this section is to set forth guiding principles for traditional neighborhood development design and to allow relief to some of the prdpud standards in   and  for tnds when such developments are found to substantially meet the guiding principles of this section bguiding principles for organizational purposes the guiding principles have been divided into six categories  however most principles relate to multiple categories a tnd must substantially meet these principles where the development application does not meet a principle the applicant shall submit justification therefor unless the principle is described as optional the guiding principles are as follows 1the principles of the public realm athe central element of traditional neighborhood design is the emphasis and weight given to the public realm the streets and plazas and the public open spaces such as parks playgrounds greens and natural areas together with semipublic spaces which frame the public realm and provide transition between public and entirely private spaces btnds feature welldesigned public spaces special emphasis on public and cultural buildings and special design treatment for vista terminations ca sense of enclosure is maintained along the public street appropriate ratio between the height of building fronts and the distance between buildings on opposite sides of the street where street frontage consists of single story buildings or open space street trees can be a substitute for front building walls to maintain this sense of enclosure dnonresidential buildings are set at or very near the sidewalk in most situations the same is true for attached housing single homes have relatively shallow setbacks typically onefourth to onethird the lot width encroachments are allowed for porches steps bay windows and balconies ethe public realm is appropriately landscaped unless good landscape design would otherwise dictate each street is provided with an orderly regimen of street trees of substantial nursery stock which will grow quickly to provide a street canopy planting strips wide enough to accommodate street trees typically separate sidewalks from street roadways see division b2f fsinglefamily home lots in tnds are typically smaller and narrower than in conventional subdivisions a substantial amount of land area savings from reduced lot sizes is dedicated toward common areas gnarrower lots necessitate alternative treatment of certain fixtures that can diminish the aesthetic quality of the public realm a system of rear access lanes alleys can provide garage access at the rear of the lot this is especially preferred for lots less than 50 feet in width when built to a 16foot standard with a 24foot rightofway the alley can also serve as an appropriate location for electric gas cable tv and telephone equipment as well as access for garbage pickup and mail delivery on lots at least 50 feet wide alternate less preferred methods of garage access include in descending order of preference 1front driveway accessing a garage behind the house or near the back of the lot  2turning the garage so that it does not face the front provided the garage is set behind the front building line  3setting the garage at least 20 feet behind the front of the house  or 4providing special architectural treatment to the house to visually deemphasize a garage at the front where alleys are not available other measures are taken to hide unsightly utility equipment  however fire hydrants are always located on the fronting street ideally situated on planting strip bulbouts at intersections htnds are designed so that there are linkages between the private realm and the public realm while protecting private spaces single homes have front porches large enough for sitting six to eight feet minimum depth and attached dwellings typically have sitting porches or front stoops guidelines to allow for low front picket fences are often provided always for single homes served by alleys and where feasible and designed appropriately for town homes private spaces are protected at the rear using privacy devices according to the development guidelines the bottom floor of any dwelling whose sidewalk facing wall is within five feet of such sidewalk should be elevated sufficiently above the sidewalk to provide additional privacy inside the dwelling itnds are designed to feature vista terminations at multiple locations vistas can terminate to important buildings parks and greens civic features in the town center a carefully sited dwelling a curve in the road natural green edge distant objects and scenery and other features as appropriate entry into the community usually uses an important vista termination to provide a sense of place arrival jutility wiring is underground and decorative street lighting fixtures are typically provided exceptions are provided for industrial areas 2the principles of the transportation system atnds always have a connecting web of streets typically provided by a grid or modified grid street pattern the street system is organized in a comprehensible network hierarchy that forms an orderly discernable neighborhood or town structure bculdesacs are avoided unless natural site or site boundary conditions require them in such situations special street design features such as eyebrows and culdesac loops are encouraged instead of standard ballend culdesacs ccurved as well as straight streets are allowed  however each must contribute to the connecting web where possible curved streets maintain the same cardinal orientation long blocks are to be avoided with an average block being no more than 600 feet in length or 1800 feet in perimeter dwhile the sense of enclosure described in division b1c above will help to reduce traffic speeds additional design measures will be needed to slow traffic examples of such measures include such features as bulbing out the curb line at intersections traffic circles streets no wider than necessary to provide adequate access design for and encouragement of onstreet parking and safe but unconventional street geometrics the internal streets should be designed to feel safe driving at a speed no more than 25 miles per hour etypical street widths include 34  38 feet for a main street with marked parking on both sides  32  34 feet for lesser streets with marked parking on both sides  27  29 feet for with marked parking on one side  24  26 feet for standard streets with unmarked parking allowed to stagger from side to side  2024 feet for low density local streets with unmarked parking on one side  20 feet for oneway streets with parking on one side  and 16 feet for public residential alleys private alleys may be allowed as narrow as 12 feet with commercial alleys typically being 24 feet where possible streets are encouraged to narrow to 22  24 feet at intersections and at midblock cross walks curve radii at intersections are ten feet to 20 feet depending on street function standard vertical curb is preferred and it is required on all residential streets without driveways auto access is provided via a rear alley and all commercial streets ftnds are always walkable communities in the fullest sense they typically contain sidewalks on both sides of the street and in addition may contain a network of offroad walking and bike trails pedestrian facilities always meet the three standards of safety comfort and interest sidewalks are well separated from the roadway with planting strips that are planted with indigenous mostly deciduous shade trees on commercial streets sidewalks may extend to the curb with street trees planted in grates or other sufficiently sized planting space planting strips should be six feet to ten feet wide eight feet is recommended but may be reduced to four feet in situations that are both unusual and difficult sidewalks are recommended five feet in width on residential streets wider on commercial streets gtnds always have multiple points of ingress and egress from collector and major roads the street system should also flow seamlessly to adjoining neighborhoods either existing or future htnds are never gated iparking lots should not front along a street onstreet parking is provided throughout the development and particularly so on streets with commercial buildings and attached housing where additional parking is needed it is provided behind buildings in the interior of the block the calculation of parking needs for nonresidential uses should always take into consideration available onstreet parking and the expected walkable patronage parking lots shall include shade trees and no space in a parking lot shall be further than 60 feet from the trunk of a shade tree each shade tree shall be planted in a planting area sized and shaped to enable healthy growth a minimum of 200 square feet pedestrian access from interior block parking area is best provided via a midblock passageway to the street front this passageway can also be used for other activities such as front entrances for small shops access to second floor apartments outdoor dining outdoor vendors and outdoor display of plants flowers and other appropriate items for sale jwhen located on a public transit route a dry inviting waiting place is provided at the neighborhood center where not located on a transit route the tnd should be given consideration for future route expansions when ridership can be expected 3the principles of mixed use atnds almost always contain a mixture of uses and dwelling types exceptions may be made for tnds of less than 25 acres andor one that is within safe easy walking distance to retail and other neighborhood services btnds always feature a mixture of residential types while a mix of single homes and at least one type of attached housing is required in the development an appropriate and carefully designed blending of single and attached housing within the development is encouraged ctnds offer housing at a variety of affordability levels allowing garage apartments and granny flats at the rear of single home lots in accordance with the developments private guidelines whether rented or not is encouraged these innovative but historically traditional housing forms help to accommodate family situations and promote income diversity within the tnd dlivework units shop or office at the street level and residence at the second level apartments over businesses and covenant provisions for zeroimpact customary home occupations are encouraged ein traditional communities the denser housing and livework units are typically located closer to the town center with a transition outward to less dense housing such as single homes this principle should not be construed to discourage the careful blending of housing types as this transition occurs fschools and churches are encouraged within the tnd as is the provision of pedestrian and bicycle routes to connect to such facilities inside or outside the tnd it is however recognized that school location will in most cases not be possible unless the public school system considers smaller site standards gwhere buildings are on both sides of the street similar building types should face each other when possible single house townhouse livework unit apartment building and store building are examples of building types htnds are expected to provide some onsite andor adjacent to site employment opportunities this can include employment in the services and stores within the tnd livework units the owners dwelling over hisher shop or office or larger employment centers such as office buildings and light industry industry should be located along a major road at the outer edge of the tnd where direct major road access is provided for trucks and workers who live elsewhere also appropriate transition and pedestrian access must be designed between the industry and the neighborhood industrial buildings and their sites should include features sympathetic to traditional design principles along with landscaped and natural areas used to create transition to the rest of the tnd 4the architectural principles athe architecture should respond to the surrounding fabric of buildings and spaces and to local traditions the principle that structures should be seamlessly linked to their surroundings within the tnd transcends the issue of style beach building always exhibits principles of human and pedestrian scale and contributes appropriately to the pedestrian life of the street carchitecture within the development should reflect styles that are complimentary of each other private development controls assure a variety styles or substyles which serve to compliment each other while providing for overall consistency and reflection of the principles of traditional neighborhood design daffordability variations between housing types and choices do not translate into meaningful inferior architectural treatment of lower cost housing choices as such housing relates to the public realm ecommercial buildings typically take on a shop front type appearance joined by common walls set with the front and entrance at the sidewalk along the street and are typically two or more stories high other uses such as residential and offices may occupy upper floors commercial buildings should not face intersecting streets with blank walls fresidential buildings other than bungalows and patio homes should be at least two stories tall gexcept to more accurately portray pre1940 architectural styles buildings should employ relatively flat fronts and simple roofs note this principle shall not be construed to require pre1940 architectural styles building articulations and setback encroachments for porches stoops steps bay windows balconies and other such features that form the transition between the public and private realms are encouraged hcornerlot homes should face their front door to the larger street unless said street is a thoroughfare except for an endunit townhouse or row house which may turn the corner with its front unless the side street is an alley fronting a townhouse on both the primary street and the intersecting street with two doors andor wraparound porch is encouraged 5the principles of the neighborhood center atnds have at least one defined center neighborhood centers typically feature uses such as shops and services livework units attached dwellings apartments over businesses a formal open space such as a village square or green and publiccivic buildings church community buildingcenter and post office are examples bautomobile oriented uses are typically not found in a neighborhood center and drivethru facilities are strongly discouraged  an exception may be made for a bank abutting a thoroughfare ca public gathering space such as a plaza green or square is almost always present along with one or more focal features in or near this public space such as a clock tower fountain monument bandstand andor public art which serve to terminate vistas and define the community dthe tnd center is ideally located near the geographic center of the development  however it may also identify itself jointly with a thoroughfare bordering the tnd and therefore be located near this major road or be linked to this road with an entrance street in order that businesses within the center may more easily attract patrons from outside the development this can serve to improve chances for economic success of the tnd center ideally the neighborhood center is no farther than one quarter mile radius of most dwellings  however a neighborhood center that is within 2400 feet of 80% of the dwellings in the tnd is acceptable in order to allow the center to identify itself jointly with an adjoining thoroughfare edevelopment form in the center typically reflects the traditional main street or town square vernacular of the region as described in division b4e above and parking is provided in accordance with division b2c above fother civic uses are encouraged including schools and day care centers  however such uses should take on design features and lot sizes sympathetic to traditional principles and a walkable community office employment may occur at the tnd center or along major roads adjoining the tnd light industrial employment if present is more appropriately located along a major road boundary in accordance with division b3c above gat least one site should be reserved at or near the neighborhood center for an important community or civic building such as a community center church school amenity center club house and recreation facility or community hall the site should be prominent and special 6the principles of open space and natural site characteristics aa substantial amount of land savings generated by a more compact development form is converted to common open spaces btnds always have formal public open spaces such as greens village squares parks and playgrounds they may also have substantial amounts of natural or seminatural open spaces that typically feature more informal amenities such as walkingbicycling trails and picnic areas cthere is always a significant civic space such as a town square green commons or plaza at the neighborhood center dsmall parks are distributed throughout the development usually within 1000 feet of any dwelling epreexisting or natural water features should be retained and made a community asset fthe site should be designed in a manner that preserves specimen trees and significant groups of mature deciduous trees major tree stands should be incorporated into public open spaces where possible gthe neighborhood design should adapt itself as much as possible to the existing topography to minimize the amount of grading necessary to achieve a viable street network hparks plazas and commons should be equipped with proper furnishings and shade trees to encourage outdoor sitting human interaction and people watching  while some common areas should be grassed and left open except for street trees to encourage the types of leisurerecreational activities that require open areas crelief or establishment of greater standards to certain prdpud requirements in order that tnds may meet the principles set forth in this section the following provisions of   and  are hereby modified for developments which are found to substantially meet the guiding principles of tnd 1 b4 5 and 6 for tnds minimum setbacks shall be the same as for transitional infill developments tids allowed encroachments into rear setbacks along the project boundary include accessory buildings including accessory dwellings up to ten feet 20 feet for two stories from project boundary  utility equipment  alleys up to eight feet provided an evergreen tree planting strip is provided if the alley is not used by development outside the project boundary  fences and walls  and uses allowed to encroach according to section 17132 where commercial uses within the tnd adjoin single family areas outside the tnd the planning commission may require additional setbacks not to exceeding a cumulative total of 50 feet 2 b11 tnds shall meet the same requirement as a tid parking spaces inside garages are counted 3 b13 except for rear access alleys driveways and parking drivesaisles private streets are not allowed in tnds 4 b15 minimum screening requirements do not
