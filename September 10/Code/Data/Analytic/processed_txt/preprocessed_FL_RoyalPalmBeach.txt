projected number of persons for the project  divide this number by one thousand 1000  multiply the resulting number by the park standard of ten 10 acres per one thousand 1000 persons 2 for multifamily and mobile home facility developments the average number of persons per dwelling unit equal two and onehalf 25  multiply this by the number of dwelling units proposed to arrive at the projected number of persons for the project  divide this number by one thousand 1000  multiply the resulting number by the park standard of ten 10 acres per one thousand 1000 persons 3 for senior housing facility congregate care facility assisted living facility and nursing home facility developments the number of persons shall be determined by the maximum number of occupants based on the approved site plan for the facility  divide this number by one thousand 1000  multiply the resulting number by the park standard of ten 10 acres per one thousand 1000 persons h formula for fees in lieu of land dedication 1 general formula if it is determined by the village council that no park or recreation facility is to be located in whole or part within the proposed residential development to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development then the residential developer shall in lieu of dedicating land pay a fee equal to the value of the land acreage determined by the formula in section 2255g above and in an amount determined in accordance with section 2255h3 below such fee to be used by the village for acquisition or development of park and recreational land which will serve the residents of the area being developed 2 determination of land or fee the village council shall determine whether to accept land dedication or elect to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof by consideration of the following a topography geology access and location of land in the development available for dedication  b size and shape of the development and land available for dedication  c the feasibility of dedication  d availability of previously acquired park property  e conformity with the recreation and open space element of the comprehensive plan  f if fifty 50 percent of the land required to be dedicated to the village is provided as private open spacefacilities for park and recreational purposes within a proposed residential development so that a credit would be given in accordance with section 2255h5 below and the remaining fifty 50 percent of land required to be dedicated to the village is less than three 3 acres in size then the residential developer shall be required to pay a fee in lieu of land dedication for the land that is less than three 3 acres in size  and g if fifty 50 percent of the land required to be dedicated to the village is provided as private open spacefacilities for park and recreational purposes within a proposed residential development so that a credit would be given in accordance with section 2255h5 below and the remaining fifty 50 percent of land required to be dedicated to the village is ten 10 acres or more in size then the residential developer shall be required to dedicate the land that is ten 10 acres or more in size to the village no fees in lieu of dedication shall be accepted 3 amount of fee in lieu of land dedication where a fee is required to be paid in lieu of land dedication either in whole or in part the amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land which would otherwise be required to be dedicated pursuant to the formula prescribed above the fee shall be paid pursuant to the provisions contained in this section fair market value of the land shall be determined by a an appraisal of the property by a qualified real estate appraiser approved by the village such appraisal shall be obtained at the residential developers own expense and such appraisal shall value the land based on the highest and best use in the applicable zoning district  or b the contract purchase price of the land so long as proof of purchase price is provided to the village in a form acceptable to the village and the salepurchase of the property did not occur more than two 2 years prior to the determination by the village council of the amount of the fee to be paid in lieu of land dedication 4 criteria for requiring both dedication and fee the residential developer shall

such portion shall be dedicated for local park or recreational purposes and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions set out above shall be paid for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to the above provisions b when sufficient park and recreational land in the vicinity has already been acquired by the village and only a small portion of land is needed from the residential development to complete the site such remaining portion shall be dedicated and a fee computed pursuant to the formula provided above shall be paid in an amount equal to the value of the land which would otherwise have been required to be dedicated such fees to be used for the improvement of the existing park and recreational facility or for the improvement of other local parks

41912 findings the village finds and determines that uncontrolled drainage and development of land has a significant adverse impact upon the health safety and welfare of the village community further village finds as follows a stormwater runoff is capable of carrying pollutants into receiving bodies thereby degrading water quality  b the increase in nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen resulting from stormwater runoff accelerates eutrophication of receiving water bodies and adversely affecting flora and fauna  c improperly channeling water increases the velocity of stormwater runoff and increases erosion and sedimentation  d construction requiring the alteration of natural topography and removal of vegetation tends to increase erosion  e siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases the capacity of water bodies to hold and transport water interferes with navigation and harms flora and fauna  f impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of storm water runoff and allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge  g improperly managed stormwater runoff may increase the incidence and intensity of flooding which endangers property and human welfare  h substantial economical losses may result from adverse impacts upon the waters of the village ecosystem  i village has an existing stormwater management program it administers various stormwater management functions and maintains a system of storm and surface water management facilities including but not limited to conduits manholes channels ditches waterways

age of existing infrastructure rehabilitation and replacement of some portions of the existing stormwater system and implementation of new stormwater systems are required  l all developed property in village either uses or benefits from the villages administration of the its stormwater management program  m the extent of use of the stormwater program by each property depends upon factors such as

all customers based in part on the impact of runoff from the impervious areas of their property on the stormwater system  and o management of the villages stormwater program to protect the public
