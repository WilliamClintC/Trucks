using temporary and portable structures only variance procedure nature of variances  appeal board  conditions for variances  nature of variances a the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this title would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners b it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this title and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of chapters 6840 and 6850 cmc have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in cmc upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this title for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in cmc to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in cmc  see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in cmc of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use  provided that the provisions of subsections a of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance g upon consideration of the factors of cmc a and the purposes of this title the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this title title 70 building and construction chapters 7001 uniform administrative building and planning permit fees and deposits 7003 building numbers 7004

the city council of the city of coronado finds and determines that a the city is a member agency of the san diego association of governments sandag a joint powers agency consisting of the city the county of san diego and the 17 other cities situated in san diego county acting in concert the member agencies of sandag acting in their capacity as the san diego county regional transportation commission developed a plan whereby the shortfall in funds needed to enlarge the capacity of the regional system of highways and arterials in san diego county the regional arterial system could be made up in part by a transportation uniform mitigation fee on future residential development as a member agency of sandag the city participated in the preparation of a certain rtcip impact fee nexus study dated  the nexus study prepared pursuant to california government et seq the mitigation fee act b the city council has been informed and advised and finds that future development within san diego county and the cities therein will result in traffic volumes exceeding the capacity of the regional arterial system as it presently exists c the city council has been further informed and advised and finds that if the capacity of the regional arterial system is not enlarged the result will be substantial traffic congestion in all parts of san diego county and the city with unacceptable levels of service throughout san diego county by 2030 d the city council has been further advised and so finds that funding in addition to those fees adopted pursuant to the nexus study will be inadequate to fund construction of the regional arterial system absent implementation of a regional transportation congestion improvement plan rtcip fee based on the nexus study existing and known future funding sources will be inadequate to provide necessary improvements to the regional arterial system resulting in an unacceptably high level of traffic congestion within and around san diego county and the city e the city council has reviewed the nexus study and finds that future development within the county and city will substantially adversely affect the regional arterial system and that unless such development contributes to the cost of improving the regional arterial system the regional arterial system will operate at unacceptable levels of service f the city council finds and determines that the failure to mitigate growing traffic impacts on the regional arterial system within san diego county and the city will substantially impair the ability of public safety services police and fire to respond the failure to mitigate impacts on the regional arterial system will adversely affect the public health safety and welfare g the city council further finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the use of the rtcip fee and the type of development projects on which the fees are imposed because the fees will be used to construct the transportation improvements that are necessary for the safety health and welfare of the residential and nonresidential users of the development projects on which the rtcip fee will be levied h the city council finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the need for the improvements to the regional arterial system and the type of development projects on which the rtcip fee is imposed because it will be necessary for the residential users of such projects to have access to the regional arterial system such development will benefit from the regional arterial system improvements and the burden of such development will be mitigated in part by the payment of the rtcip fee i the city council further finds and determines that the cost estimates set forth in the nexus study are reasonable cost estimates for constructing the regional arterial system improvements and that the amount of the rtcip fee expected to be generated by new development will not exceed the total fair share cost to such development j the city council further finds that the cost estimates set forth in the nexus study are reasonable cost estimates for the facilities that comprise the regional arterial system and that rtcip fee program revenues to be generated by new development will not exceed the total fair share of these costs k the fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used to help pay for the construction and acquisition of the regional arterial system improvements identified in the nexus study the need for the improvements is related to new development because such development results in additional traffic thus creating the demand for the improvements l the city council finds that the nexus study proposes a fair and equitable method for distributing a portion of the unfunded costs of improvements to the regional arterial system m the city council adopts the nexus study and incorporates it in this chapter as though set forth in full

i2 limited vicinity map figure i3 project area map b background coronados distinctive peninsular location and historic development have resulted in a community that is unique intriguing and inviting the development of coronado dates to 1886 when elisha s babcock and hl story the joint owners of the entire coronado peninsula formed the coronado beach company subdivided a portion of their holdings cleared the land graded streets and conducted coronados first land auctions the next year babcock and story built the hotel del coronado with money generated by the land sales in 1888 the hotel del opened for business ushering in the tradition of luxury beachside resort hospitality and in 1890 the city of coronado was incorporated coronados admirable physical environment combined with the historic charm of the hotel del coronado has contributed to a destination resort and residential community the wealth of many of coronados early residents permitted commercial civic and residential development of the quality that surpasses most cities of similar size this strong architectural heritage is one of presentday coronados defining characteristics moreover the citys strong tourist industry combined with multiple naval installations historically reinforced a strong diverse commercial district due to compact urban design commercial and civic facilities are easily accessible to pedestrians and bicyclists from most parts of the city coronados citizenry and government responded to these trends in the communitys quality of life in several ways including establishment of a downtown task force and coronado mainstreet ltd orange avenue corridor design guidelines revised parking and signage provisions in the zoning unified transportation plan transportation management association and business area development plan these efforts have resulted in the downtown streetscape project median landscaping preservationrestoration of the historic spreckels building opening of the lambs players theatre and the orangeadella enhancement project other related planned projects include a new city hall and recreation center along glorietta bay and the proposed hotel del coronado expansion and improvement plans downtown coronados renaissance has been highly successful as evidenced by the year 2000 great american mainstreet award and the year 2003 dozen distinctive destinations award from the national trust for historic preservation some challenges still remain and new issues have arisen including  growing concern about the downtown evolving into a touristserving district and the desire for expanded retail opportunities for residents  availability of convenient parking  continued expansion of discounted retail on north island  ability of local businesses to compete with corporate establishments  recent closure of the citys only movie theatre  prospect of increasing traffic volumes  need for improved aesthetic land use pedestrianbicycle and vehicle connections these challenges are either not addressed by existing planning documents or the existing provisions are written as guidelines and lack implementation mechanisms in 200 the citys commitment to preserve and enhance downtown coronado continued with the citys decision to develop a specific plan for the orange avenue corridor c land use description the orange avenue corridor project area includes four basic land uses  commercial retail restaurants motels office and services multifamily residential and civic  open space  which are described below and shown on figure i6 generalized existing land use c1 commercial the commercial areas of the orange avenue corridor contain primarily retail shops restaurants motels offices and personal and business services commercial along the orange avenue

characterized by a curving streetscape accented by unique architecture with historic character small retail centers totaling more than 94000 square feet sf of retail space are located on orange avenue between the southern terminus of c avenue and the hotel del coronado the retail mix in the core is similar to that found throughout the remainder of the orange avenue corridor but introduces modest amounts of apparel books housewares jewelry and specialty retail shops the retail mix is slanted toward eating and drinking and businesspersonal service uses other retail categories are not well represented local residents appear willing to support business and personal service providers but exhibit price sensitivity on purchases of general merchandise and comparison goods preferring to shop outside the city for these items coronados approximately 60000 sf of office space is concentrated in the extreme southern portion of the downtown area south of 10th street slightly over 56000 sf of office space is concentrated in three primary locations california plaza 33000 sf coronado plaza 9500 sf and el dorado square 13800 sf coronados office inventory also includes small amounts of

interactive atmosphere  outdoor dining pedestrians on street opportunities for community to interact with each other  orange avenues main street atmosphere  a gathering place  the boardwalk of coronado  everything is physically close  hotel del coronado as a tourist draw small shops that are easy accessible by walking or biking  unique look of small businesses  eclectic architecture styles  buildings like el cordova hotel del coronado and the spreckels building  what should be removed from orange avenue  nonretail uses from orange avenue as it creates gaps between shops and is a detriment to a viable shopping district  vacant lots and buildings  relocate real estate offices and liquor stores from orange avenue to the side streets  north of the library is more residential but it is not an inviting area until the ferry landing  buildings are not kept up as they are further south  rundown buildings and stretches of orange avenue that dont fit eg shop appearance or type of goods sold  replace the old movie theater with a new one  mixed use as vertical mixed uses are not working especially ground floor retail with condominiums on top  what should be added to orange avenue  redevelop the entire vons block with an entertainment center incorporating the existing facade arcade for kids food court bring back existing businesses create an anchor tenant underground

local laws public hearings with the planning commission and the city council were held these hearings provided additional opportunities for the community to offer input on the specific plan b specific plan policy framework the orange avenue corridor specific plan policy framework provides the primary policy guidance for the specific plan all future development and redevelopment within the orange avenue corridor specific plan shall be consistent with and take guidance from the goals and objectives as expressed in this policy framework for the orange avenue corridor specific plan is organized as follows  specific plan planning factors identifies the opportunities and constraints that influence and contribute to the successful implementation of the orange avenue corridor specific plan  specific plan goals provides the broad goals that future development and redevelopment in the specific plan area shall implement  specific plan objectives provides more explicit policy statements that implement the specific plans goals b1 specific plan planning factors this section describes those factors that influence and contribute to the successful implementation of the orange avenue specific plan as they form the policy foundation of the specific plan planning factors express issues concerns and the positive and negative attributes that contribute to the ultimate policy actions of this specific plan the planning factors draw from community input  market analysis mobility and parking studies  and observations by the planning consultant team the planning factors are listed below and are grouped into the following categories  policy  land use & urban design  parking  economic  marketing  traffic  circulation policy planning factors  develop a communitybased plan the specific plan area stretches along orange avenue and includes the southern commercial area referred to as downtown by residents  the northern commercial area adjacent to the ferry landing  and the multifamilyzoned residential area in between coronado residents merchants and property owners all have various feelings about how these different areas should be preserved or how they should change change is an inevitable part of a citys evolution but that does not mean it should proceed in an uncontrolled manner a community that directs its future can keep and enhance what is valued while encouraging and allowing changes that will contribute to the communitys vision  establish predictableunderstandable criteria and standards the existing orange avenue design guidelines revised 1991 are well written and cite good examples of design but are nonspecific and not regulatory this means that development proposals can ignore them developers and designers efforts to interpret such guidelines are sometimes different from the understanding of city staff design review commissions or decision makers this uncertainty ultimately harms the city because developers property owners and lenders perceive that it may be too risky to attempt improvements or projects that may benefit the community land use & urban design planning factors  mixed use mixed use development defined for this specific plan as residential above commercial is a controversial topic in coronados commercial zone concerns regarding mixed use include 1 may create additional traffic  2 increased development intensity  3 marginal commercial uses  and 4 privacy issues residential development provides customers for adjacent commercial uses but commercial uses sometimes have characteristics that create problems for residents such as noise or unpleasant odors it is perceived that mixed use developers in the commercial zoned areas profit from the residential units while the additional commercial square footage may not be needed also there is concern that currently viable commercial properties will convert to mainly residential use condominiums and slowly eliminate existing downtown businesses  white elephant buildings vacant buildings such as the cora mart and the village theater present unattractive gaps in coronados urban fabric influence the appearance of adjacent buildings and do not add to the communitys economic vitality the village theater holds special memories for most of coronados longtime residents and has nostalgic symbolism as the communitys indoor gathering space it is where families went to the movies together teenagers had their first dates and children experienced their first afternoon matinees free of parental supervision emotionally residents dont like seeing the theatre inactive other functional buildings are also white elephants in that they do not contribute to the streetscapes strong pedestrian environment such as the petco store and the bank of america building photo 4 village theater  protect points of community pride the community has specific unique features that it strongly identifies with and wants to protect such as the landscaped medians on orange avenue photo 5 landscaped median  existing zoning doesnt create the desired scale in general the community wants to maintain the lowrise one and twostory human scale development currently in the commercial zones  however the current zoning allows buildings that are taller 3story and bulkier than most buildings currently found on orange avenue  create a central civic space most successful downtowns have a significant public open space that brings citizens together to celebrate community to attract people downtown activities need to be scheduled in a comfortable and central location coronado has spreckels park for outdoor cultural activities but an urban space much closer to downtowns commercial area is needed as stated in the business area development plan a focal point such as an enhanced rotary park would complement and balance the hotel del coronados future entry garden area corner of orange and rh dana place and adella plaza a central outdoor space would also give strolling visitors a significant destination and provide a place for residents to informally gather  better wayfinding is needed there is a term in urban design called wayfinding that is urban design efforts must help people find their way to a place and within the place many people unfamiliar with downtown coronado do not know how to get there after disembarking from the ferry driving off the bridge or coming up the strand they also are uncertain where to go once they are downtown signage for parking surface and underground directional signage and downtown directories and kiosks are lacking and needed parking planning factors  parking requirements impact intensity of development to satisfy parking requirements for new development or for redevelopment greater than the buildings original square footage relatively large lots are required this is because the parking must be put underground or within a structure where it is more difficult to accommodate the cars turning movements the result is that smaller lots are difficult to redevelop and may simply deteriorate over time or lot consolidations create projects that are bigger than what the community wants  location of public parking public parking located in the rightofway along city streets is desirable for reasons of convenience and pedestrian safety community members are concerned about the visual effects of parking structures photo 6 onstreet parking  vacant land for surface parking limited vacant land that could be used for surface parking in the downtown commercial area is virtually nonexistent a few existing buildings have surface parking lots on orange avenue such as la avenida and petco demographic  economic planning factors  small population base and isolated geography coronados population base is relatively small in comparison to other cities in the region the citys ability to compete for retail sales in a trade area beyond coronado is hampered by is physical separation from san diegosouth bay proper which in turn limits the citys potential to attract a broad range of national retail tenants the citys population growth is stagnant and at least with respect to retail sales potential the enlisted and retired military personnel are considered absent because they primarily utilize onbase retail as opposed to orange avenue retailers  high incomes household and per capita incomes in coronado are very strong as compared with comparable incomes for the san diego region these factors indicate that coronado residents have aboveaverage amounts of disposable income to spend on goods and services  strong military presence coronado is home to two major military installations the naval amphibious base nab and naval air station north island nasni the baserelated workforce is estimated at approximately 35000 inclusive of enlisted officers and civilian workers although the military bases provide topquality onbase retail and services to enlisted and retired military personnel spillover demand from the military for services is a positive economic generator for the city  exporting retail sales potential the city is exporting the vast majority of its retail sales potential out of the city the most recent figures available indicate that coronado is retaining only 35% of its sales potential this is due in large part to the presence of the navy exchange at north island naval air station nasni and an abundance of established discount retailers and superregional malls on the mainland  retail sales competition the navy exchange at nasni offers approximately 100000 square feet of shopping comparable to a walmart or target inclusive of a food court and other amenities adjacent to the nasni exchange is a 48000 sf commissary the nasni exchange offers a standard discount of approximately 17% before sales tax and the commissary offers a 30% discount neither exchanges nor commissaries are subject to state or local sales tax regimes four regional malls offering nearly five million square feet of anchor stores and inline space are located within seven miles or within 25 minutes drive of downtown coronado  dont compete the orange avenue retail corridor should not attempt to compete with the navy exchange at north island naval air station nasni to recapture general merchandise sales the scale of the exchange and the deep discounts offered to activeduty and retired military personnel residing in coronado cannot be overcome by the local business district  develop unique retail the city should encourage businesses that contribute to create a unique retail environment oriented to oneofakind upscale retail  village theater it is thought that a singlescreen theater can be supported by the local nonmilitary population despite the presence of firstrun movies at nasni however finding an operator for a single screen movie theater may be difficult and expensive  office demand overall the office market is healthy with relatively low vacancy throughout there may be moderate demand for suites larger than 1000 sf to serve tenants wishing to expand  however this segment is dominated by real estate agents and financial service firms and is not considered a deep pool of prospective tenants there is not a significant demand for new office buildings within the plan area but the city should consider facilitating periodic infusions of office space in mixeduse buildings as warranted by market conditions  lack of assemblage opportunities there are few vacant sites within the boundaries of the plan area that can be combined to form larger development opportunities moreover existing parcels tend to be narrow and deep fronted by orange avenue and backed by multiunit residential properties  disagreement between city and business many business and property owners expressed the opinion that the city is overly restrictive and unsupportive of the business community fair and consistent policies must be established and followed in order to overcome the skepticism regarding the objectives of city government b2 specific plan vision the overall vision for the specific plan area is to maintain a small town village atmosphere for commercial residential and civic land uses in a pedestrianfriendly environment that provides a balance between resident and visitor needs b3 goals objectives and implementation strategies  actions the following goals and objectives

chapter discusses the purpose and applicability of the commercial zone design criteria design criteria for site planning storefront design buildings landscapehardscape signs and public spaces within the commercial zone are given and their application to commercial properties is discussed following this discussion is a review of coronados role model buildings taken directly from the 1985 coronado design guidelines for the orange avenue corridor revised in 1999 photo 7 lambs players theater a1 purpose the purpose of the design criteria is to protect the special identity of the commercial areas of coronado the criteria are intended to  improve the quality of physical changes  protect the architectural character  act as a basis for objective decisionmaking  increase public awareness of architectural quality  prevent incompatible new construction  require that all alterations and signage be presented to the design review commission photo 8 adella pedestrian plaza these design criteria acknowledge the prevailing built environment and existing development patterns within coronados commercial areas especially downtown the criteria therefore do not seek to impose an overriding style a limited color palette or an artificial theme instead they are meant to promote the positive design characteristics currently existing throughout the downtown it is not the intent of these design criteria to eliminate design freedom or discourage innovative design these criteria are less quantitative than the mandatory development standards and may be interpreted with some flexibility in the application to specific projects the design criteria complement the mandatory development standards contained in this specific plan by providing good examples of appropriate design solutions and by providing design interpretations of the various mandatory regulations a2 interpretation to aid in the interpretation of these criteria a development applicant should understand the meaning of shall permitted and not permitted criteria that employ the word shall are intended to be applied as stated an alternative measure may be considered however if it meets or exceeds the intent of the criteria criteria using the words permitted and not permitted are mandatory and are much like zoning regulations in that they must be followed or a variance can be sought a3 applicability the provisions of this section are applicable to all development within the orange avenue corridor specific plan area it is required by the city of coronado that the design review committee approve all projects including new construction additions exterior alterations or landscaping prior to review by the design review committee projects should adhere to these design criteria as applicable it is important to note however that these criteria do not affect existing buildings that are not proposed for new construction exterior alterations landscaping or changes in parking lot layout in other words the criteria are not retroactive the design criteria will be applied during the citys development approval process applicant shall request the criteria and be provided with them during preapplication conferences this procedure is meant to encourage the highest level of design quality while providing the flexibility necessary to encourage creativity in response to existing site conditions photo 9 storefront details add interest for pedestrians a4 organization the design criteria are organized into the following sections a introduction provides an overview of the purpose interpretation application exemption organization and other aspects of the design criteria b site planning and design includes criteria for building and parking location and design in relationship to the street its street edge condition c storefront design provides criteria that promote quality design for the ground floor of new infill buildings and rehabilitation of existing buildings d building criteria presents architectural criteria applicable to commercial projects within the specific plans commercial areas e landscapinghardscape design provides a basic landscape design framework that is to be used in conjunction with new development and as a helpful tool for property owners interested in upgrading the landscaping of existing development photo 10 maintain downtown as a friendly place for pedestrians bicyclists and motor vehicles f parking circulation and access provides design criteria for parking areas circulation and access g structured parking includes criteria specific to design of parking structures h signage and advertising sets forth general and specific criteria to enhance the image of commercial areas and improve the effectiveness of signage for businesses i public spaces includes criteria associated with plazas courtyards and public art within the commercial areas b site planning and design b1 relationship to street a projects relationship to the street its street edge condition is determined by setback requirements and by which type of edge conditions are appropriate for that particular location this section provides guidance for physical site design and configuration photo 11 wide sidewalks maximize the opportunity to provide outdoor dining mixed with pedestrian spaces offering vegetation paving materials and awnings a provide corner cutoffs for buildings located at prominent intersections b place the groundlevel front elevation of the building at the front property line and at the sidewalk edge to maintain the continuity of the street wall especially along orange avenue c avoid large setbacks from the sidewalk edge unless it is to provide space for small outdoor dining and shopping areas landscaping and other pedestrian oriented uses d create continuous pedestrian activity by minimizing gaps between buildings e avoid parking lots that interrupt commercial space f avoid blank walls and other dead spaces at the ground level g create pedestrian paseos to parking lots at the rear of buildings figure vi1 site planning and design diagram c storefront design photo 12 use of transom windows awnings and outdoor seating make this an attractive neighborhood eatery c1 introduction although the storefront is only one of the architectural features of the facade it is the most important visual element for protection of the pedestrian atmosphere traditionally the storefront had few decorative elements other than those details that were often repeated across the face of the building integrating the storefront into the character of the facade the rest of the storefront was designed in a simple manner in order to not compete with the displayed items but rather to clearly project the product or service being offered inside the storefronts along orange avenue have experienced the greatest amount of change and hold the greatest potential for creative alterations affecting both the character of the building and the streetscape when existing buildings of quality undergo changes of use they should maintain their original exterior design character while undergoing interior renovations in the case of renovation of nondescript buildings these design criteria for new buildings should be followed so that these more ordinary structures begin to contribute life and interest to the village environment photo 13 storefronts with decorative cornice to promote quality design for new infill buildings and the rehabilitation of existing buildings the following specific storefront and facade criteria are presented figure vi2 traditional storefront appearance achieved with contemporary materials c2 entriesdoorways commercial storefront entries are typically recessed andor sheltered by a covered arcade structure canopy or awning this provides more area for display space provides a sheltered transition to the interior of the store and emphasizes the entrance recessed entries with second floor overhangs should

sidewalk and may not include ramps or steps leading into the storefront b storefronts shall be of a scale and nature compatible with neighboring buildings figure vi3 recessed entry detail c3 facade treatment a the use of light subdued or neutral colors and natural building materials such as brick and terracotta are encouraged as the base color photo 15 attractive brick building faade c4 awnings and canopies awnings and canopies can play a special role in bringing visual harmony to downtown coronado the addition of an appropriate awning can create a pleasant transition between unrelated upper facades and storefronts canopies are different than awnings in many ways a canopy is usually permanently affixed to the building flat and made of solid materials these are referred to as brow canopies photo 16 awning color and shape relate to the windows proportions the following criteria shall be considered a awnings should be simple in color containing a maximum of three colors lettering and trim utilizing other colors is permitted but is considered as a sign area see signs and advertising for awning signage guidelines figure vi4 awning detail b awning shape should relate to the window or door opening barrel shaped awnings shall be used to complement arched windows while rectangular or square awnings should be used on rectangular windows c when there are several businesses in one building

translucent awnings are prohibited c5 door design traditionally the storefront door was more than just a door tall in proportion its design reflected its commercial importance its construction made it substantial and inviting to the customer storefront doors within the specific plan commercial area should have a similar role the following general criteria should guide the design of doors a accentuate the door with simple details such as a handsome brass door pull brass kickplate or an attractive painted sign b retail shop doors should contain a high percentage of glass minimum of 50% to allow views of the store contents c6 display window design the use of display windows as an architectural element is of critical importance to the storefronts design windows create a visual rhythm of

character of the original building is strongly discouraged d to add relief to the wall surface glass should be inset a minimum of 3 from the exterior wall surface windows that punctuate facades and provide access to light and air flow are encouraged as they give buildings much of their character c7 storefront accessories the following design criteria should be considered for storefront accessories a permanent security bars and window air conditioning units on the first floor are prohibited b mechanical appurtenances attached to building facades should be enclosed by a housing that

17 transom windows with awning below d the use of air conditioning units placed in individual windows and window transom areas are prohibited e if security grills are necessary they should be placed inside the building behind the window display area photo 18 air conditioning unit in upper floor window d building criteria as in many older towns and cities downtown coronado serves not only as the heart of the community but also as its strongest visual image these visual impressions affect the way residents and visitors feel about the city and are often an indication of the communitys economic vitality photo 19 spreckels building exhibits classic storefront and second floor detailing the general building design criteria presented here are intended to promote good design in order to create a

introduction landscaping in coronados commercial areas should achieve three specific ends 1 beautify the area and create a pedestrian oasis  2 soften commercial development  and 3 unify the area as a pleasant environment for residents and visitors alike these three ends will be accomplished by a recognizable use of repeated planting treatments consistency and continuity within the street

the r4 multiple family residential zone located along orange avenue primarily between second and eighth streets includes some nonresidential buildings primarily motels amongst the residential buildings residential character and style discusses the multifunctional nature of the r4 zone readers should note that many of the criteria presented in commercial zone design criteria can be adapted to the special character of the r4 area therefore following of this chapter the remaining criteria emphasize modifications from the commercial zones criteria to appropriately address the r4 neighborhood existing nonresidential buildings in the r4 zone are allowed to remain any existing business remodeling in this area should utilize the criteria found in this section as general criteria for scale and design b residential character and style the r4 multiple family residential zone sits at the hub of coronados village area the commercial areas radiate from it to the north and south along orange avenue while to the east and west lower density housing spreads out at decreasing densities this r4 zone shares the commercial areas scale general streetscape and some of its uses with the setbacks landscaping and building character similar to the lower density residential zones while the r4 area does include some minor nonresidential uses it is primarily residential in character and should retain a residential not commercial ambiance photo 56 welldesigned multifamily housing can be an attractive positive addition to the community the r4 zone segments orange avenue into commercial and residential areas helping to distinguish the commercial activity areas in addition the area serves as a transition both between these uses along orange avenue and between the downtown and the remaining residential areas of the community photo 57 this buildings scale relates to other buildings along orange avenue while attractive landscaped setbacks enhance the transition into the residential zone the multifunctional nature of the r4 area places unusual demands upon design professionals therefore designers should demonstrate particular sensitivity in their projects so that this most urban of the citys residential neighborhoods can be maintained and enriched as in the commercial areas there is no one style or decor that is appropriate for the r4 zone while projects can be designed to differ from neighboring development they should maintain the overall unity and ambiance of the area photo 58 projecting balconies porches and varied rooflines add visual interest and break up the building mass c architectural criteria c1 character defining elements a there is no particular architectural style proposed for multifamily residential structures in the specific plan area the primary focus should be on constructing a high quality residential environment b a visual balance or rhythm should be created by the dimensional ratio of multifamily buildings their elements and the spaces around them c architectural elements that add visual interest scale and character to the neighborhood are encouraged such as bays bay windows recessed or projecting balconies and verandas c2 building design criteria a large expanses of flat wall planes and boxy and monotonous facades that lack a sense of human scale are strongly discouraged b building heights should be varied and building facades should use horizontal andor vertical offsets to help give the appearance of a collection of smaller structures c to screen the stairs from view to the greatest extent possible stairways should incorporate a solid or decorative balustrade photo 59 decorative balustrade enhances the building faade d prefabricated metal stairs are strongly discouraged e all mechanical equipment whether mounted on the roof or ground should be screened from view utility meters and equipment should be placed in locations that are not exposed to view from the street or they should be suitably screened all screening devices are to be compatible with the architecture and color of the adjacent buildings figure vii1 visual screening of utilities c3 building scale and height multiple family developments can often dominate adjacent uses the following criteria are provided to address building scale massing and height design issues all multiple family projects on orange avenue shall incorporate the following  photo 60 multiple family developments can dominate adjacent uses the mass of this apartment complex has been broken up to resemble individual homes a new multiple family residential development shall consider the multiple family development in the immediate area use of similar setbacks complementary building arrangements buffer yards and avoidance of overwhelming building scale and visual obstructions  b building designs shall be sensitive and compatible to adjoining multiple family developments with respect to building height scale and massing  c building designs shall take into consideration the shadows the building scale casts onto adjoining multiple family developments  d awnings moldings pilasters and comparable architectural elements that increase the building articulation are encouraged arcades and other types of overhangs should be used to provide a human scale relationship between building faade and sidewalk photo 61 awnings stairs and an overhang help to break up the building mass e the perceived height and bulk of multistory buildings should be reduced by dividing the building mass into smallerscale components and adding details such as projecting eaves dormers and balconies photo 62 a tiered setback helps to scale down the building faade c4 building materials a building materials should be durable low maintenance and relate a sense of quality and permanence frequent change of materials should be avoided b the building and its elements should be unified by textures colors and materials c exterior columns for trellises porches or colonnades should utilize materials and colors that are compatible with the adjacent building photo 63 use of high quality materials enhance this buildings design features c5 roofs a rooflines should be segmented and varied within an overall horizontal context varying heights are encouraged b combinations of one two and three story units create variation and visual interest and are encouraged c use of vertical elements such as towers may be used to accent the predominant horizontal massing and provide visual interest d hipped or gabled roofs covering the entire building are preferable to mansard roofs flat roofs or segments of pitched roofs applied at the buildings edge photo 64 a gable pitched roof chimneys and details such as paint and decorative railings add to the interest and charm of this building e roofs should reflect a residential appearance use of materials f roof pitch for a porch may be slightly lower than that of the main building c6 colors a color is an important element in establishing the character of a structures design the predominant color of dwelling units and accessory structures should have a muted neutral tone b bright or intense colors may be used very sparingly but should typically be reserved for refined or delicate detailing such as grillwork or more transient features such as awnings signs and utility doors d signs and symbols signage in the r4 zone should be interesting informative and of a scale appropriate to the building facade signs must reflect the residential character of the neighborhood every effort should be made to avoid commercial looking signs in keeping with the character of the building the style of the r4 area signs should embrace coronados villagelike character for example a sandblasted wood sign hanging from a lamppost at the end of a sidewalk would be an appropriate addition to a residential building simple classic signage is preferred in the r 4 zone individual architectural letters made of metallic finishes such as antique gold bronze and copper are encouraged external spotlights create pleasing shadows and contrast adding to the beauty of the building exterior photo 65 signage for the rothbury manor a creative use of neon is encouraged in the commercial areas and neon signs may be appropriate in certain r4 zone applications b signs that are painted directly on the building are acceptable such signs should exhibit high quality design and craftsmanship c regular maintenance of signs is required since there is a tendency to fade over time d internally illuminated can signs with translucent copy and field are prohibited throughout the commercial zone and would not be considered appropriate in the r4 zone e while the content of the sign should be determined by the individual property owner or designer care should be taken to assure that the building facade does not become a billboard a simple address number and the name of the building when appropriate is usually sufficient examples of appropriate signage for the r4 zone are la casa mia casa de anza rothbury manor photo 66 signage for the casa de anza e public safety through design public safety can be improved or achieved design techniques such as attention to paving surfaces visibility and adequate nighttime lighting the following design criteria are intended to improve public safety in the commercial zone a strongly delineate publicprivate space with paving building materials grade separations or with physical barriers such as landscaping fences walls screens or building enclosures photo 67 creative use of materials such as this lattice fence helps define private space and provides visibility onto the public sidewalk b all site entrances should be visible from a public street or alleyway and very well lit c open spaces courtyards circulation corridors and individual living unit entrances in multifamily complexes should be designed to be visible from as many dwelling units as possible f contextgeneral project considerations a all new multifamily development in the specific plan area should be compatible with the character of existing quality development and should respect the context of their site b existing site amenities should be preserved and incorporated within new multifamily projects whenever feasible c views mature trees and similar amenities unique to the site should be preserved and incorporated into development proposals whenever possible e new landscaping should complement the existing landscape materials location and massing on adjacent established developments where appropriate g site planning g1 building siting a buildings should be generally oriented parallel to streets with varying setbacks to provide visual interest and varying shadow patterns photo 68 new multifamily residential development uses setbacks complementary building arrangements buffer yards and avoids visual obstructions b the maintenance of privacy is an acceptable design factor  therefore applicants shall demonstrate an effort to promote privacy to the greatest extent possible g2 parkingcirculation for multifamily development to sustain high quality and positive character attention should be paid to onsite pedestrian and vehicular circulation a principal vehicular access into multifamily projects should be via rear alley access where available rather than from the street front photo 69 access to underground parking is available from a side street b multifamily parking areas should be divided into a series of connected smaller parking courts or be underground c blank walls garage doors parking facilities and driveway openings along street frontages should be minimized to avoid adverse visual impacts d courtyard doors or gates used at multifamily building entries should be attractively designed as an important architectural feature of the building or complex the main site entry shall incorporate patterned concrete or decorative pavers e special accents such as monumental articulation of the building or appropriately scaled art ornamental features decoration special textured paving flowering accents walls shrubs and the use of specimen trees should be used to generate visual interest at entries photo 70 attractive alleyways include landscaping pavement material changes and balconies f where possible all multifamily projects should incorporate pedestrian connections to adjoining residential uses commercial projects and other compatible land uses photo 71 driveway does not overwhelm the building from the street side g3 trash and storage areas a trash enclosures should be located in convenient nonobtrusive areas such as inside parking courts in subterranean lots in rear alleys or at the end of parking bays all trash enclosures shall be covered b trash enclosures should be located to allow access for refuse collection but should not block circulation drives or conflict with parking or c trash bins shall be located within a masonry structure or other approved solid trash enclosure that protects adjacent uses from noise and odors gates should be solid metal painted to match adjacent building design d trash enclosures should be adequately screened from adjacent units figure vii2 trash enclosures should be well designed and adequately screened with landscaping e architectural screening elements should be constructed of the same materials and finishes as the primary building g4 lighting a street lighting should be installed on both sides of the street no less than 150 feet apart b all lighting in both underground and surface parking areas shall illuminate the entire lot yet be arranged to prevent direct glare from illumination onto adjacent units c pedestrianscaled lighting should be located along all pedestrian routes of travel within multifamily projects d all lighting shall be designed to shine downward and eliminate all skyward glare mobility wayfinding and parking a introduction this chapter includes nonregulatory information on vehicular circulation transit bikeways pedestrian walkways wayfinding and parking b vehicular circulation b1 existing conditions automobiles are the primary means by which people access coronados downtown and they will continue to be the primary mode in the foreseeable future it should be relatively painless for someone to get to and from coronados downtown figure viii1 see next page shows the roadway classifications in coronado within the specific plan area orange avenue designated as state route 75 south of third street along with third and fourth streets are principal arterials with four lanes of traffic orange avenue north of third street is a minor arterial while first street sixth street tenth street and b avenue are two lane collectors traffic flows figure viii2 portrays traffic flows along key roads downtown for the year 200 as measured in average daily trips adt traffic flows are heaviest on orange avenue between fourth street and tenth street and on fourth street from orange avenue to the bridge at slightly under 30000 vehicle trips per day figure viii2 traffic flows in downtown coronado for the year 2000 primary destinations for much of the commute traffic coming over the bridge are the north island naval air station and military facilities located further south on the strand major visitor destinations are the hotel del coronado and the downtown commercial zone restaurants shopping and plays b2 current planning traffic congestion occurs in the blocks surrounding the intersection of the thirdfourth street couplets and orange avenue and not only during commute hours there are ongoing efforts by the city and caltrans to address traffic issues on a citywide scale which would improve vehicular circulation within the specific plan area b3 recommendations improvements that can be made to traffic flows in the downtown coronado specific plan area relate primarily to efforts to reduce the number of auto trips on orange avenue two primary strategies are recommended improved parking a better managed parking supply means that fewer autos would need to circle streets looking for a parking space figure viii1 roadway classifications improved transit properly configured operated and designed transit may be able to siphon off somewhere between 10 and 20 percent of traffic from orange avenue according to initial ridership estimates prepared by sandag on the impact of mtdbs longrange transit first plan transit is further discussed in the next section c transit c1 transit today as shown in figures viii3 and viii4 coronado is currently served by four transit routes operated under the direction of the metropolitan transit development board mtdb 901 902 903 and the coronado shuttle route 904 these routes connect coronado to surrounding communities as well as transfer points to other transit services for the most part current transit routes serving coronado may be characterized as slow and limited serving primarily a transitdependent population in general fewer than 1500 people travel by transit along orange avenue on any given weekday 2001 data with the majority of them traveling coronado to destinations on the other side of the bridge or down the silver strand c2 transit tomorrow mtdb has proposed a number of improvements to the regional transit system most notably transit first strategic plan the transit first plan proposes four kinds of transit services colorcoded as yellow car red car blue car and green car the existing trolley system is seen as a part of an expanded red car system incorporating both light rail and bus rapid transit brt components red car service is corridorfocused much like the existing trolley system traveling at speeds of 15 to 30 mph with stations spaced approximately every mile sandags regional transportation plan includes a proposed red car line connecting coronado to downtown san diego hillcrest and university town center this line will operate similar to mtdbs existing trolley but will use rubbertired vehicles that resemble a cross between a bus and a trolley car flextrolleys are expected to enjoy priority treatment on roads c3 recommendations it should be a goal of the city to encourage visitors to use transit to access coronado where such transit can actually meet the needs of these persons whether visitors local business employees or local military installation personnel and employees increased transit use decreases auto trips reducing the pressure on parking road congestion and overall traffic efforts should be made to ensure that future transit lines in coronado connect appropriate areas both within and outside coronado  that transit routes are outfitted with signalpriority systems and other means to speed services to their maximum safe potential  and that customer convenience and comfort is considered see the mission groups 2002 report mobility plan for downtown coronado specific plan for more detail figure viii3 the coronado shuttle route 904 operates hourly figure viii4  existing transit routes serving coronado the 901 is an allday service 15 minute frequency peak period 30 minute frequency offpeak  whereas the 902 and 903 only operate during peak hours d bicyclingpedestrian circulation d1 existing conditions coronado is a city well suited for bicycling the traditional street grid pattern relatively wide streets attractive streetscapes abundant landscaping mild climate and relatively flat elevations combine with the many sights of coronado to create one of the most attractive bicycling environments found in any city the street grids high degree of connectivity gives cyclists a choice of routes and the ability to easily reach most city destinations the wide streets which operate at generally low traffic volumes outside of orange avenue and the third streetfourth street couplets create safe zones for cyclists who may be passed safely by cars the variety of architecture landscaping and scenic views make cycling in coronado a visual pleasure and an interesting experience in general traffic is not a major impediment to cyclists except on orange avenue and on the thirdfourth street couplets or getting across those couplets just the same there is little to be recommended for improving bicycle travel tofrom the downtown outside of special pathways such as the silver strand bike path the safest place for cyclists is on the road the use of alleyways as alternative routes for bicyclists is generally not recommended due to a heightened risk of accidents most motorists do not expect cyclists to emerge from alleyways and cross over or merge with traffic d2 bicycle racks the real issue facing cyclists accessing coronados downtown is where to safely leave their bicycles while they take advantage of shopping dining entertainment or even employment opportunities since bicycles can bring riders closer to their destination than a car could most cyclists expect to find bicycle parking closer to their destination than a car driver would in searching for parking bicycle racks should be provided throughout the commercial areas located in appropriate wellilluminated places to reduce the possibility of theft or vandalism but not obstruct pedestrian activity d3 pedestrian walkways coronado is one of the most pedestrianfriendly cities in all of southern california and its downtown is generally very accommodating to pedestrians sidewalks are wide storefronts are mostly continuous and interesting and attractive landscaping enlivens the experience it is a short easy walk  approximately 10 to 15 minutes on level surfaces  from much of coronado to the commercial areas along and near orange avenue potential future implementation strategies to further enhance the pedestrian environment include expansion of rotary park located at the intersection of orange avenue with isabella avenue tenth street and park place this is the hinge point of downtown coronado where orange avenue turns to the southeast unfortunately the streetscape edge on the western side of orange avenue breaks down at this key point where inappropriately sited buildings create more of an auto zone than a pedestrianscaled zone perceived distances on this segment of orange avenue are exaggerated which affects pedestrians decision to continue walking or to turn back it also influences the pedestrians feeling of safety as they must interact with cars crossing from many streets and parking lots and therefore need to exercise a higher degree of caution a redesigned western edge of orange avenue between tenth street and park place would significantly improve the pedestrian experience and increase their willingness to walk a little further to get from parking to their orange avenue destination alleys limit pedestrian circulation in the alleys because most alleys run parallel to orange avenue offering little in the way of short cuts between any given points  and the alleys generally serve vehicular uses quite well employee residential and limited customer parking in addition to commercial loading all take advantage of this resource the alleys permit orange avenues commercial zone to be generally free of the curb cuts garage entrances and other disruptions to streetscape and sidewalk that mar many other cities downtown areas because most sidewalks in downtown coronado are welldesigned pedestrian friendly and conveniently located most buildings open onto the sidewalk not a rear parking lot there is no real desire need or incentive for most pedestrians to use the alleys e wayfinding e1 introduction wayfinding refers to a system of design features eg signs lighting landmarks directories used to both help people orient themselves and navigate between places once viewed as a navigational aid wayfinding systems now are seen as a way to market an areas resources alter negative perceptions evoke a sense of downtown history and character and improve the streetscape for years welldesigned wayfinding systems have been used by indoor malls airports and corporate campuses now these environmental graphics are being used increasingly often by traditional downtown commercial areas people make qualitative assessments about a place based upon how welldesigned and understandable it is to find where they need to go currently the only wayfinding in the specific plan area is caltrans standard green and white signs and occasional california state historical site signs a well thought out wayfinding system will orient visitors to coronado by pointing out attractions adding historical explanations directing vehicles to parking facilities for specific activities and locating amenities the vehicular traveler approaching coronado over the bridge is greeted by a simple yet elegant classicdesign entry sign located on the left side of the road while the sign is well designed due to its location on an inside curve it can be easily overlooked by arriving visitors the city may want to relocate the sign to a more visible location at some future time photo 72 entry sign on third avenue arriving at orange avenue one sees a california historical marker for the hotel del coronado and caltrans generic green business district sign directing travelers both north and south on orange avenue orange avenues signature landscaped medians provide a strong sense of identification for the orange avenue corridor and the downtown area the visual impact of the northern median end although less than in the south was enhanced by additional landscaping in 2003 that helps to create a stronger entry statement e2 directional signage visitors approaching downtowns commercial areas will need easily recognizable directional signs to help them locate important destinations it is very important that these signs are  graphically interesting  unique public signage  used in the commercial zone only it is recommended that all new public wayfinding signs incorporate a custom designed downtown logo by separate graphic artist over a field of color and a crisp nonitalicized lettering style there are several city locations that visitors and residents could be directed to some of these locations are outside the orange avenue corridor  however it is very important to link the commercial areas with these attractionslocations while it is not practical as part of the specific plan to list every single place that could be identified on directional signs the following are considered excellent candidates  city hall  library  police station  post office  marina  spreckels park  ferry landing  rotary park after expansion  hotel del coronado  history museum  public beach  uptown & downtown commercial area the graphic example shown in figure viii5 is for illustration concept purposes only it is recommended that these images be refined further or that a new distinctive public signage program be developed for the orange avenue corridor figure viii5 conceptual directional signage businesses located on less traveled side streets have less exposure to pedestrian and vehicular traffic than do businesses on orange avenue directional signage for side street businesses is allowed but must congregate in a single location such as a street corner the directional signage should be designed as public art compatible with its surroundings and contribute to the overall pedestrian environment e3 parking signage various activities in coronado are served by different parking areas eg shopping in the downtown commercial area or going to the beach parking signage that both directs users to parking areas and indicates the nearby activity helps users to park in the most convenient location for their purpose see figure viii6 for an example figure viii6 conceptual beach parking signage e4 street signage a unique street sign should be created and installed for all street corners within the specific plan area this helps create an identity and sense of place that is distinct from the rest of coronado figure viii7 is a conceptual design for such signage figure viii7 conceptual street signage e5 kiosk program the previous sections focused on vehicular signage  however once people are out on foot a system of pedestrian informational kiosks is desirable for orientation and to stimulate interest in walking further the kiosks would display a key map with various destinations see list above kiosk design should be compatible with the character of the specific plans commercial areas for planning purposes the following locations are recommended for kiosk locations  downtown commercial area in near proximity to hotel del coronado andor adella plaza  rotary park after expansion  uptown commercial area near the ferry landing f parking the mission group prepared a parking study as part of the orange avenue corridor specific plan process while portions of the study are summarized below the full document is available at city of coronados community development department the parking study looked at conditions in the commercial areas within the specific plan area and some residential blocks outside of the specific plan area but adjacent to it the parking studys area encompasses coronados northern and southern commercial centers and included 20 blocks of offstreet parking and 85 block faces of onstreet parking see figure viii8 for the purposes of the study the larger area was divided into three subareas see figure viii9 figure viii8 parking study area figure viii9 parking study subareas f1 existing parking conditions onstreet parking there are 1269 onstreet parking spaces available within the study area before  pm forty percent 505 spaces are metered and 60 percent 764 spaces are nonmetered an additional 39 nonmetered spaces are available only after  pm when commercial loading zone spaces become available for public parking figure viii10 shows the total onstreet parking spaces available before  pm segment totals are for block sides that face each other eg the east and west side of orange avenue between first and second streets twelve percent 157 spaces of all onstreet parking spaces are located on isabella avenue fourteen percent 183 spaces of all onstreet parking spaces are located along orange avenue twelve percent of metered spaces are located on isabella avenue onethird of all metered spaces are within one block of the intersection of orange avenue and tenth street figure viii10 onstreet parking inventory before 6 pm offstreet parking within the study area there are 1432 total offstreet parking spaces available to customers and employees of commercial uses figure viii11 of these 204 spaces are in lots with limited hours these lots include the bank of america parking garage block 13 an office lot block 14 and a commercial lot block 13 on weekdays these lots are not available to the general public after  pm on weekends 92 of the spaces are not available at all office lot in block 14 99 are not available after  pm bank of america garage and 13 are not available after  pm commercial lot in block 13 figure

number of parking spaces available in a specified area onstreet parking is generally considered optimal when 85 percent of the available parking spaces are occupied at any given time this rate ensures that a parking space is almost always available for arriving cars but that all other spaces are occupied once utilization exceeds 85 percent parking becomes progressively more difficult to find areas can exceed 100 percent utilization when multiple vehicles are parked in a space intended to fit only one car when vehicles are parked illegally or when vehicles are doubleparked during weekdays onstreet parking in the study area is consistently heavy with the highest overall demand at lunchtime 81 percent of spaces occupied and the lowest between  pm and  pm 66 percent of spaces occupied overall parking is impacted in the commercial core of coronado but the extent was rarely severe during the periods surveyed for example although parking along most street segments in the southeast subarea were fully or oversubscribed parking was still available along nearby streets on weekends overall demand for onstreet parking is even more constant than on weekdays with a tight range of 6876 percent utilization parking utilization in the southeast subarea is highest especially for the two mealtime periods    pm and    pm f3 future demand coronados commercial areas are virtually built out but some redevelopment of underutilized lots expansion of existing businesses or tenant changes are likely to occur resulting in the need for more parking keyser marstons market study for downtown coronado june 2002 notes that the type of businesses with the strongest potential to succeed include restaurants oneofakind specialty retailers upscale boutique retailers and specialty food outlets the additional parking demand that would be generated by any new development or redevelopment will be subject to the parking requirements of this specific plan factors which contribute to coronados parking situation are a downtown coronados relatively small storefronts combined with its pedestrianfriendly character effectively create an environment where people park in one place and patronize several businesses within a couple blocks instead of parking separately for each destination b different commercial uses have different peak demand times such as offices from  am to  pm restaurants during lunch and the live theater during the evening because of this peak demand is spread out throughout the day instead of occurring at one time f4 parking recommendations the study of parking utilization in coronado confirms that much of the commercial core of this city is parking impacted meaning that demand outstrips supply the situation is especially pronounced in the central and southeast subareas with the southeast portion showing the greatest demand during the day as well as additional evening impacts the north section is also impacted but in a much more concentrated manner with parking always available near impacted areas given the nature of potential development redevelopment in each of the three subareas the following strategies are recommended for ensuring minimal parking impacts a encourage large developments in the specific plan area to provide more offstreet parking than is required b as a shortterm strategy to increase parking in the southeast subarea explore options to lease or assume liability for public parking in existing private facilities during those hours for which those facilities are closed c ensure that an adequate number of metered spaces on orange avenue are designated for relatively shortterm parking 30 minutes or one hour maximum in order to best support resident access to local businesses d revise the parking that parking requirements are based solely on square footage  parking requirements based on number of employees or number of seats should be eliminated infrastructure a introduction utility service infrastructure such as water wastewater and storm drainage facilities are essential services and allow for the orderly growth and redevelopment of a community per the citys 1986 general plan service infrastructure for city of coronado has been found satisfactory to accommodate the general plan land uses and intensity of use the specific plan area is largely built out and the specific plan does not increase residential density or commercial floor area nor does it intensify the land uses set out in the general plan or the zoning   therefore coronados existing infrastructure framework is generally considered adequate to service the specific plan land uses for informational purposes these facilities are briefly discussed in this section of the specific plan b water service the city of coronado obtains its domestic water from the californiaamerican water company the company whose primary supplier is the city of san diego the san diego county water authority cwa supplies approximately 90 percent of san diegos water imported from the colorado river and the california water project while the remaining 10 percent of the raw water supply comes from local reservoir systems owned and operated by the city of san diego the company service boundaries include the entire city of coronado potable water is supplied by two trunk lines  one is a 24inch transbay pipeline from san diego that enters coronado at first street and a avenue at the northeast end of the city while the other is a 16inch main that comes up the strand from imperial beach additionally a second 24inch line under the bay from san diego supplies north island with water the two 24inch trunk lines are interconnected for backup supply in the case of an emergency or other event that would cause one of the trunk lines to be out of service since a facilities improvement program was completed in 199 coronados distribution system is free of main and service leaks provides excellent water pressure and is well

orange avenue corridor specific plan effort formerly called downtown specific plan a market study with a demographic overview and evaluation of current conditions for commercial residential and hotel land uses within and around the specific plan area was prepared by keyser marston associates june 2002 the reader is encouraged to read the entire market demand study on file in the community development department at city hall the following is a summary of the market demand study market overview introduction this section identifies coronados demographic trends  provides an overview of market conditions for retail residential office and lodging  and includes kmas key observations on real estate market conditions  the citys assets and constraints  and main factors affecting various land uses the conclusions were reached process of interaction with stakeholders city staff and navy service providers as well as analysis of market conditions and economic trends demographic overview coronado has approximately 24500 residents  onethird are military personnel 8100 persons and twothirds are civilians 16400 persons coronados overall demographic characteristics reflect an affluent nonethnic community with high proportions of seniorsretirees and youthful military personnel the following bullet points summarize demographic characteristics of coronados combined military and civilian population unless otherwise indicated  population and income  population growth declined slightly between 1990 and 2002 061%  over the next five years population growth is expected to be relatively static 076% annually adding about 950 persons by 2007  household incomes are strong  approximately 69% of households have yearly incomes more than $50000 and roughly 51% have incomes more than $75000  per capita income pci in 2002 was estimated at approximately $40000 which is much higher than city of san diego $27500 or the county $26400  coronados median household income in coronado $76900 far outpaces the city $54833 and county $56039  if looking only at civilian census tracts coronados pci rises by more than $11000 to approximately $51300 equating to an annual spending potential of $842 million median household income increases to nearly $81000  age coronado is a mature community with many seniors and for the most part coronados age distribution is similar to age distributions in the city of san diego and the county of san diego notable exceptions include  coronado has a lesser share of residents in the under 20 years age group 205% as compared with the city and county of san diego at 273% and 287% respectively  coronados share of 2024 year olds is much higher than the city of san diegos share and nearly double that of the county of san diego this is attributable to the large proportion of the military population within this age category  coronado has a higher proportion of seniors aged 60 and above this age segment represents nearly 20% of the citys population at least 5% higher than metropolitan or regional geographies  ethnicity the resident population in coronado is less ethnically diverse than in the citycounty of san diego whites are the predominant ethnic group comprising 838% of the population other ethnicities 71%  african americans 52%  and asians 40% approximately 103% indicate hispanic heritage many of these statistics change dramatically when the military census tracts are removed as detailed below  coronados civilian population becomes more elderly and even less ethnically diverse  the median age rises from 34 years to 46 years  the proportion of residents aged 20 to 24 years falls from 159% to just 36%  the proportion of residents aged 45 and over increases from 353% to 514%  the 60 and over age category jumps from 191% of the population to 284%  the proportion of ethnic residents declines from 163% to 690% and the percentage of whites rises from 838% to 932% retail market overview this section describes coronados commercial zone identifies year 2000 trends in retail sales the most recent year for which complete data is available and provides key retail findings and recommendations  retail market districts the retail concentration along the orange avenue corridor is segmented into two main districts north of second street and south of eighth street the intervening blocks from second street to eighth street are dominated by dense rental housing condominiums and small hotelsmotels north commercial area the area north of second st is primarily restaurant anchored including eating and drinking establishments and a grocery store the north areas retail mix includes approximately 39000 sf of touristserving uses located at coronado ferry landing a touristoriented specialty retail center although the ferry landing is outside the specific plan boundary its size and proximity influence the specific plan area downtown commercial area most of the plan areas retail space is located along orange avenue south of eighth st extending to the hotel del coronado the area is comprised of dense storefronts generally narrow and deep in configuration occupied by localserving retailcommercial users the downtown retail segment is dominated by the following categories  eating places  personal services  business services  tourist serving the true core of the coronados retail market lies in the area between tenth st and the hotel del coronado this area is characterized by a curving streetscape accented by unique architecture with historic character a number of small retail centers totaling more than 94000 sf of retail space are located on orange avenue between the southern terminus of c avenue and the hotel del coronado the retail mix in the core is similar to that found throughout the remainder of the orange avenue corridor but introduces modest amounts of apparel books housewares jewelry and specialty retail shops the retail market is performing well at the current time lease rates are strong and vacancy is low throughout downtown however the retail mix is slanted toward eating and drinking and businesspersonal service uses other retail categories are not well represented downtown local residents appear willing to support business and personal service providers but exhibit price sensitivity on purchases of general merchandise and comparison goods preferring to shop outside the city for these items  retail sales trends it is possible to estimate total retail sales for a given retail category based on the citys population and the income characteristics and expenditure patterns in the region import of retail sales is assumed to occur when the actual level of retail sales in a given category exceeds potential retail expenditure when potential retail expenditures exceed actual sales export is evidenced in such cases it is assumed that coronado residents are exporting a portion of their expenditure potential to other jurisdictions in 200 coronados retail sales potential amounted to approximately $2695 million in the retail categories detailed below actual sales in 2000 were $956 million leading to the conclusion that coronado exported sales of approximately $1739 million in 2000 coronado exports sales in each retail category excepting the eating and drinking category sales in the eating and drinking category exceeded estimated expenditure in coronado totaling 135% of potential this is due largely to the citys strong tourism base the specific plan area should capitalize on its existing tourist base and strive to create a unique retail destination featuring upscale retailers and goods that appeals to both residents and visitors the types of tenants representing the strongest potential to succeed in the specific plan area include restaurants  oneofakind specialty retailers  upscale boutique retailers  and specialty food outlets such as whole foods or trader joes  key retail findings and recommendations  currently coronados economy is in equilibrium the citys actions to limitrestrict the introduction of chain retailers and national credit tenants and to forego active marketing campaigns in support of the tourist industry have not adversely affected the citys economy or property values  the city is exporting the vast majority of its retail sales potential out of the city the most recent figures available indicate that coronado is retaining only 35% of its sales potential this is due in large part to the presence of the navy exchange at north island naval air station nasni and an abundance of established discount retailers and superregional malls on the mainland  the citys potential for attracting a large national discount retailer or general merchandise powerhouse is limited by a small population base b lack of available sites c lack of accessvisibility to freeway arterial and d strong competition from navy exchange  the orange avenue retail corridor should not attempt to compete with the navy exchange at north island naval air station nasni to recapture general merchandise sales the scale of the exchange and the deep discounts offered to activeduty and retired military personnel residing in coronado cannot be overcome by the local business district  the city should encourage businesses that contribute to create a unique retail environment oriented to oneofakind upscale retail an objective should be to retain local merchants and attract new merchants whose uniqueness will a add to downtowns ability to offer both merchandise and ambiance that is difficult to duplicate in most shopping centers and other downtowns b help to establish and maintain downtown coronado as a significant destination retail location and c serve the retail needs of local residents  service uses eg plumbers electricians automotive etc are not appropriate for orange avenue moreover commercial lease rates in downtown are unattractively high for such users the city should seek to establish suitable locations elsewhere in the city  the village theater should be revived to serve as an anchor for downtown it is thought that the singlescreen theater can be supported by the local nonmilitary population despite the presence of firstrun movies at nasni however finding an operator for a single screen movie theater may be difficult and expensive office market coronados approximately 60000 sf of office space is concentrated in the extreme southern portion of the plan area south of 10th street slightly over 56000 sf of office space is concentrated in three primary locations california plaza 33000 sf eldorado square 13800 sf and coronado plaza 9500 sf coronados office inventory also includes small amounts of secondstory space that lacks amenities such as air conditioning eg the winchester building and the spreckels building there have been no new office buildings built in coronado since the early 1980s when california plaza and el dorado square were constructed overall the office market is healthy with relatively low vacancy throughout there may be moderate demand for suites larger than 1000 sf to serve tenants wishing to expand this is evidenced in part by the instances of street level retail shop space being occupied by potential office users  however this segment is dominated by real estate agents and financial service firms and is not considered a deep pool of prospective tenants there is not a significant demand for new office buildings within the plan area but the city should consider facilitating periodic infusions of office space in mixeduse buildings as warranted by market conditions housing market overview the majority of housing stock within the plan area is concentrated between second and sixth streets it consists primarily of forsale condominiums and rental properties in various multiunit configurations plan area housing products vary widely with respect to age style density and orientation to orange avenue there are very few detached housing units within the plan area however attached housing values in the orange avenue corridor are strong at approximately $317sf the rental housing market is also quite strong and demand for units is high according to local leasing agents units within the plan area are much sought after by prospective renters most units are one and twobedroom units typically with 1 bath average rents for 2 br1 ba units range from $800 to $1200 per month and 2 br 2 ba units rent for between $1000 and $1300 per month reported vacancy within the plan area is quoted as zero by local leasing agents threebedroom units are rare and can rent for between $1750 and $2200 per month in proximity to the plan area lodging market overview the city of coronado is recognized as a worldclass resort destination with the hotel del coronado as its anchor the majority of coronados lodging properties are located along orange avenue or are close to the boundaries of the plan area according to estimates prepared by the coronado visitors bureau approximately one million visitors come to coronado each year the lodging market is supported primarily by three main segments of the visitor market  tourists groups and the military the hotel del coronado caters largely to groups and to a lesser extent tourists the midmarket and economy lodging facilities are supported mainly by tourists and spillover from the group market segment the more affordable properties report that the military segment currently comprises about 50% of their business as coronado military installations have increased activity and personnel in relation to the events of 911 and ongoing overseas conflicts  however this percentage has historically been lower despite the high occupancy figures typically achieved in coronado the introduction of new room supply into coronado is unlikely due to several limiting factors including  lack of encouragement from city government  lack of available sites  numerous hotel projects planned for downtown san diego  slow population growth summary of assets and constraints that affect land uses this section summarizes the aspects of the plan area and the city of coronado that either support or constrain the market conditions affecting various land uses the key assets and constraints are summarized as follows  assets  high incomes  household and per capita incomes in coronado are very strong as compared with comparable incomes for the san diego region these factors indicate that coronado residents have aboveaverage amounts of disposable income to spend on goods and services  strong demand for housing  the plan area is surrounded by dense rental and multiunit forsale housing the orange ave corridor between second st and seventh st consists primarily of housing demand for units in the plan area is very high and vacancy is practically nonexistent with many property ownersmanagers maintaining lengthy waiting lists of applicants looking for coronado housing  accessviews of the ocean and bay  coronado offers visitors and residents excellent access to both san diego bay and the pacific ocean each within almost a stones throw from the other the narrow coronado peninsula separates the tranquil bay from the crashing surf at the whitesand coronado beach recently rated as the secondbest beach in the country by the travelchannel views of the water and the san diego skyline are wonderful  hotel del coronado  the hotel del coronado is recognized throughout the world as a landmark resort destination its oneofakind historic architecture and location on coronados whitesand beach have established the hotel as an anchor of not only coronados lodging market but also of san diego countys lodging market  strong military presence  coronado is home to two major military installations the naval amphibious base nab and nasni the baserelated workforce is estimated at approximately 35000 inclusive of enlisted officers and civilian workers although the military bases provide topquality onbase retail and services to enlisted and retired military personnel spillover demand from the military for services is a positive economic generator for the city  smalltown ambience  despite its reputation as a major tourist destination and a key westcoast military installation coronado is a small town in terms of population it has retained its smalltown atmosphere by concentrating its commercial uses in a pedestrianoriented corridor reminiscent of a time before malls when shopping was a pedestrian exercise concentrated in a business district the orange avenue corridors small storefronts wide sidewalks and low buildings have preserved a small town ambience and an inviting pedestrian scale  constraints  small population base and isolated geography  coronados population base is relatively small in comparison to other cities in the region the citys ability to compete for retail sales in a trade area beyond coronado is hampered by is physical separation from san diegosouth bay proper which in turn limits the citys potential to attract a broad range of national retail tenants the citys population growth is stagnant and at least with respect to retail sales potential the enlisted and retired military personnel are considered absent because they primarily utilize onbase retail as opposed to orange ave retailers  competition from onbase retail  the only large format retailer in coronado is the us military the navy exchange at nasni offers approximately 100000 square feet of shopping comparable to a walmart or target inclusive of a food court and other amenities the nasni exchange is the eighth largest navy exchange worldwide in terms of sales volume the nab offers an additional 20000 square feet but does not provide the range of goods and services found at nasni adjacent to the nasni exchange is a 48000 sf commissary the nasni exchange offers a standard discount of approximately 17% before sales tax and the commissary offers a 30% discount neither exchanges nor commissaries are subject to state or local sales tax regimes  competition from established nodes  coronado faces stiff competition from the proliferation of regional malls in proximity to the city four regional malls offering nearly five million square feet of anchors stores and inline space are located within seven miles or within 25 minutes drive of downtown  limited transportation access  vehicular access to coronado is limited to hwy 75 from the south beach and the coronado cays and via the coronado bridge although these routes provide access beachcoronado cays from the south and from the city of san diego to the east it is not direct access to the specific plan area this may limit the citys chances of attracting national retail tenants also the $100 toll to cross the coronado bridge was eliminated in the summer of 2002 and there now may be increased traffic volumes as a result  lack of assemblage opportunities  there are few vacant sites within the boundaries of the plan area that can be combined to form larger development opportunities moreover existing parcels tend to be narrow and deep fronted by orange avenue and backed by multiunit residential properties  limited public parking  public parking in proximity to the plan area is very limited although there are parking spaces available to the public they are few in number and identifying signage is absent public parking is available in the northern segment of the plan area at coronado ferry landing and in the southern segment of the plan area at coronado plaza and along isabella ave  disagreement between city and business  many business and property owners expressed the opinion that the city is overly restrictive and unsupportive of the business community fair and consistent policies must be established and followed in order to overcome the skepticism regarding the objectives of city government title 90 coronado cays specific plan chapters
