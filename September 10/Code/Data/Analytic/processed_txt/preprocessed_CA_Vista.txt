of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may he granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristics must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of vista to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate a variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond one half acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may he issued for the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of historic structures as defined in  050 upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure s continued designation as a historic structure and the valiance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering die flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of a variance to any elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances shall only be issued upon 1 a showing of good and sufficient cause  2 a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may he issued for new construction substantial improvements and for other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections  a  e of this section are satisfied and that the structure

feet  whichever is greater  or 2 the proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than 20 feet from the edge of the wireless tower or the width of the wireless tower at the level of the appurtenance whichever is greater  or 3 the proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved not to

elements of the support structure as determined by the director  or 2 the proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of approval provided however that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval related to height width equipment cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a substantial change described in this section note the thresholds for a substantial change outlined above are disjunctive the failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds means that a substantial change would occur the thresholds for height increases are cumulative limits for sites with horizontally separated deployments the cumulative limit is measured from the originally permitted support structure without regard to any
