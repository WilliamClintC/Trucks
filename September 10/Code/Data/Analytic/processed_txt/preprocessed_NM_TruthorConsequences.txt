mexico does ordain as follows 1 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of truth or consequences are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage 2 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruptions  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in floodplains  f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and g insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area 3 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers

determined by the city that the proposed well will be located within an area of existing ground water contamination or in such close proximity to an area of existing ground water contamination that it is reasonably expected to produce water containing any organic chemical contaminant in a concentration greater than the maximum contaminant level for that contaminant permitted under the safe drinking water act of 197 as amended and regulations promulgated thereunder or greater than the allowable concentration for any organic chemical contaminant listed in subpart a of of the new mexico administrative subsection shall not be deemed to prohibit or limit the production and use of water containing inorganic chemical constituents in excess of drinking water standards whether federal or state provided that such water is not contaminated by the presence of organic chemical constituents in excess of the concentrations stated in this subsection 2 an application may be denied if it appears based on information available to the city that production of water from the well is likely to cause the migration or spread of contaminated water from an area of existing ground water contamination even if the water actually produced by the proposed well does not exceed the organic contaminant levels described in the preceding subsection where the possibility of such migration or spread of contaminated water appears to exist the city as a condition of permit approval may require that the applicant provide ground water flow modeling or other evidence and documentation by a qualified engineer or hydrogeologist satisfactory to the city demonstrating that the production of water from the proposed well will not cause the migration or spread of contaminated water to the detriment of other well users and property owners the city may limit production of water from a well to an amount less than that approved by the new mexico state engineer if it appears that such limitation is necessary to protect ground water quality  2 21114 editors note  2 adopted feb 11 201 repealed the former  14116 and enacted a new  14116 as set out herein the former  14116 pertained to
