facilities streets and specified areas c provide for citizen input into the process of naming public buildings structures facilities and streets as enumerated above d insure control for the naming of public buildings structures facilities and streets and specified areas by the city council recommendations of the public services committee i 1802 qualifying names names should provide some form of individual identity related to 1 the geographic location of the facility 2 an outstanding feature of the facility 3 an adjoining subdivision 4 a commonly recognized historical event group or individual 5 an individual or group who contributed significantly to the acquisition or development of the individual facility 6 an individual who provided an exceptional service in the interest of the city as a whole i 1802 naming process a at the time parkland or a facility is acquired but before development occurs the city will assign a nondescript temporary working name for the area or facility b once the development is initiated the public services committee will receive naming applications for review by the committee c after a name is decided upon by the public services committee public notice of the recommended qualifying name will occur once during a thirty 30 day period in the citys official newspaper citizen comments and recommendations must be in writing to the public services committee and be postmarked within the thirty 30 day public notice period d for an individual excluding historically significant individuals to be considered that person must have contributed

examination so as not to diminish the original justification for the name or discount the value of the prior contributors b only those parks public buildings structures facilities and streets named for geographic location outstanding feature or subdivision should be considered for renaming parks named by deed restriction cannot be considered for renaming c public buildings structures facilities and streets named after individuals should never be changed unless it is found that the individuals personal character is or was such that the continued use of their name for a park or facility would not be in the best interest of the city d in order for public buildings structures facilities and streets to be considered for renaming the following must occur the recommended name must qualify according to this policy and  be accompanied by a petition from the particular public park facility or street users e if a proposal is received for the naming or renaming of municipal property or the placing of a memorial on municipal property where a property or memorial already bears the proposed name the suggested name or renaming or memorial should be denied i 1802 other naming alternatives a parks public buildings structures facilities and streets that are donated to the city can be named by deed restriction or plat by the donor the naming and acceptance of land is subject to approval by the city council b facilities within parks ie playgrounds picnic shelters etc can be named separately from the parks and facilities they are in subject to the general approving policies in this policy i 1802 plaques markers memorials  all plaques markers and memorials are subject to the same naming criteria in this policy  because of their proneness to vandalism and maintenance plaques markers and memorials should be used sparingly  the public services committee subject to approval by the city council establishes the style size and placement of all plaques markers signs and memorials  it is

resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of the city of carthage missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one 1 percent chance of occurrence in any one 1 year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials for jasper county dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto b calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and over bank areas to convey the regulatory flood c computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point d delineation of

of approach zones turning zones and transition zones the outer boundary of the hazard area is composed of a circle whose center is the midpoint of the centerline of the instrument runway or landing strip and having a radius of four thousand 4000 feet and which also constitutes the outer boundaries of the approach and turning zones b the inner boundary of the hazard area is a boundary line consisting of a series of intersecting tangents five hundred 500 feet from the parallel to the centerline of the instrument runway or landing strip and two hundred fifty 250 feet from the parallel to the respective centerlines of all other runways or landing strips and connecting the inner boundaries of adjacent approach zones at the ends of the runways landing strips or proposed runways or landing strips 2 zone descriptions a an approach zone shall be located at each end of each existing or proposed runway landing strip or other portion of the airfield used regularly or to be used regularly for the landing or taking off of airplanes such approach zones shall begin two hundred 200 feet beyond the ends their respective landing strips and at such beginning be five hundred 500 feet in width for all runways and landing strips and shall extend and expand uniformly centered along the extended centerline of the respective landing strip to the outer boundary of the approach zone at a ratio of twenty 20 feet of width for each one hundred 100 feet of horizontal length for all runways the inner area of each approach zone shall be that portion of the approach zone beginning two hundred 200 feet beyond the end of the respective or proposed landing strip and extending to the intersection of the controlling glide angle with a plane one hundred fifty 150 feet above the elevation of the highest point on any runway or landing strip on the airport the outer area of each approach zone shall be the area between the inner area of the approach zone and the outer limit of the approach zone b the turning zones shall compromise all portions of the hazard area not contained in the approach zones and in the transition zones the outer limits of the turning zones shall be a circle the radius of which is four thousand 4000 feet and whose center is the midpoint of the centerline of the longest runway or landing strip c the transition zones shall be the areas bounded by the inner boundary of the hazard area the sides of contiguous inner area of approach zones and the outer limits of the transition zones  the outer limits of the transition zones being the intersections at elevations of one hundred fifty 150 feet above the elevation of the highest point on any runway or landing strip on the airport of a series of continuous planes originating from bases established by the inner boundary of the hazard area and the edges of adjacent inner areas of approach zones the planes rise from their respective bases at the rate of one 1 foot vertically to seven 7 feet
