subd 18 pd planned development district a intent 1 providing greater flexibility in environmental design and relaxation of strict application of the zoning ordinance in exchange for greater creativity and environmental sensitivity 2 recognizing the economic and cultural advantages that will accrue to the residents of a planned community 3 encouraging a more creative and efficient approach to the use of the land 4 encouraging the preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics natural features and open space 5 encouraging a development pattern that is consistent with land use density transportation facilities and community facilities objectives of the comprehensive plan b standards the provisions of this be interpreted in accordance with the following 1 rules of interpretation a where inconsistent therewith the requirements set by this section shall be followed for planned developments this section shall have no affect upon other developments or district requirements b planned developments may be excluded from certain requirements of the zoning code when specifically approved as a part of the planned development such exclusions shall only be granted for the purpose of creating better overall design and an improved living environment and not solely for the economic advantage of the developer all provisions of the zoning codes not specifically excluded in the preliminary andor final plan shall apply to the planned development c building permits shall not be issued that are not in conformity with the approved planned development d whenever a dispute arises concerning the interpretation andor application of any section of this the matter may be referred to the board of adjustments and appeals for hearing as governed elsewhere in this

characteristics on the planned development 3 minimum area for planned development the minimum total area required for a planned development shall be five acres of contiguous land tracts of less than five acres may qualify only if the applicant can show that the minimum lot area requirement should be waived because a planned development is in the public interest and that one or both of the following conditions exist a unusual physical features of the property itself or of the surrounding neighborhood are such that development under the standard zoning would not be appropriate in order to conserve a physical or terrain feature of importance to the neighborhood or community b the property is adjacent to or across the street from property that has been developed under the provisions of this section and will contribute to the amenities of the neighborhood 4 residential unit densities a planned development may provide for a variety of housing types in any one of the basic residential zoning districts the total number of dwelling units allowed in a development shall be determined by either a the density specified by the citys comprehensive guide plan a plan may provide

excess will not have an undue and adverse impact on existing public facilities and on the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property the council in determining the reasonableness of the increase in the authorized dwelling units per acre shall recognize that increased density may be compensated for by additional private amenities and by increased efficiency in public facilities and services to be achieved by 1 the location amount and proposed use of common openspace 2 the location design and type of dwelling units and 3 the physical characteristics of the site 4 open space a a primary function of this planned development section is to encourage development which will preserve and enhance the worthwhile natural terrain characteristics and not force intense development to utilize all portions of a given site in order to arrive at the maximum intensity or density allowed in evaluating each individual proposal the recognition of this objective will be a basic consideration in granting approval or denial including but not limited to the following 1 the amount and location of private common openspace area shall be consistent with the stated purpose of this section and in no case shall be less than 15 percent of the total project area the residential portion of the project area shall further conform to the mandatory public park playground and open space area dedication

maintain water quality reduce flooding and erosion provide food and habitat for wildlife provide open space and are an integral part of the citys environment wetlands are important physical educational ecological aesthetic recreational and economic assets to the city they are critical to the citys stormwater management and other aspects of health safety and general welfare regulating wetlands and the land uses around them is therefore in the public interest b in order to protect wetlands the minnesota wetland conservation act of 1991 hereinafter referred to as the wca and any future amendments thereto are adopted by reference as though set forth verbatim herein any activities exempted from the provisions of the wca are also exempted from the requirements of this section insofar as they relate to the wca the provisions of this section cover all wetlands as defined herein and including those governed by the department of natural resources subd 2 purposes and implementation a through the adoption and enforcement of this section the city will promote the general health safety and welfare of its residents by both conserving and protecting wetlands and requiring sound management practices and mitigation when development occurs in the vicinity of wetlands through the implementation of this section the city seeks to accomplish the following 1 to satisfy the requirements of the wca and thereby achieve no net loss of wetlands within the city 2 to streamline the city administration of the wca by providing sequencing and varied replacement requirements based on the functional values of the wetland and resulting management classifications 3 to allow appropriate usage of wetlands to preserve water quality and prevent downstream flooding 4 to protect and restore wetlands adjacent to contiguous open green space 5 to address potential nonpoint source impacts from future development with the establishment of wetland buffer requirements to complement existing stormwater requirements 6 to enhance wildlife values of wetlands 7 to identify potential wetland banking areas 8 manage wetlands for their sensitivity to stormwater b to accomplish these purposes the city will 1 utilize and continue to complete its wetland inventory and utilize related assessment information for wetlands in eagan 2 utilize eagans water quality and wetland management plan and the provisions of this section 3 establish conservation easements over wetlands and wetland buffers that are subject to this section subd 3 definitions building setback for

necessary element for human survival  b trees appreciably reduce the everincreasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air breathed  c trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day thereby purifying the air  d trees participate in the natural process of neutralizing wastewater passing ground from the surface to groundwater tables and lower aquifers  e trees root systems stabilize the groundwater tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation erosion control and flood control  f trees are an invaluable physical aesthetic and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land reducing noise levels and glare and breaking the monotony of human developments on the land particularly parking areas  and g trees affect the desirability of land and its property values 2 purpose based on the foregoing findings the

thereof may be charged to the sign owner or assessed against the property on which they are located k dynamic display signs 1 findings studies show that there is a correlation between dynamic displays on signs and the distraction of highway drivers distraction can lead to traffic accidents drivers can be distracted not only by a changing message but also by knowing that the sign has a changing message drivers may watch a sign waiting for the next change to occur drivers are also distracted by messages that do not tell the full story in one look people have a natural desire to see the end of the story and will continue to look at the sign in order to wait for the end additionally drivers are more distracted by special effects used to change the message such as fadeins and fadeouts finally drivers are generally more distracted by messages that are too small to be clearly seen or that contain more than a simple message time and temperature signs appear to be an exception to these concerns because the messages are short easily absorbed and become inaccurate without frequent changes despite these public safety concerns there is merit to allowing new technologies to easily update messages except as prohibited by state or federal law sign owners should have the opportunity to use these technologies with certain restrictions the restrictions are intended to minimize potential driver distraction and to minimize proliferation in residential districts where signs can adversely impact residential character local spacing requirements could interfere with the equal opportunity to use such technologies and are not included without those requirements however there is the potential for numerous dynamic displays to exist along any roadway if more than one dynamic display can be seen from a given location on a road the minimum display time becomes critical if the display time is too short a driver could be subjected to a view that appears to have constant movement this impact would obviously be compounded in a corridor with multiple signs if dynamic displays become pervasive and there are no meaningful limitations on each signs ability to change frequently drivers may be subjected to an unsafe degree of distraction and sensory overload therefore a longer display time is appropriate a constant message is typically needed on a sign so that the public can use it to identify and find an intended destination changing messages detract from this wayfinding purpose and could adversely affect driving conduct second lane changes stops or turns which could result in traffic accidents accordingly dynamic displays generally should not be allowed to occupy the entire copy and graphic area of a sign in conclusion the city finds that dynamic displays should be allowed on signs but with significant controls to minimize their proliferation and their potential threats to public safety 2 dynamic display sign means any sign except governmental signs with dynamic display characteristics that appear to have movement or that appear to change caused by any method other than physically removing and replacing the sign or its components whether the apparent movement or change is in the display the sign structure itself or any other component of the sign this includes a display that incorporates a technology or method allowing the sign surface to change the image without having to physically or mechanically replace the sign surface or its components this also includes any rotating revolving moving flashing blinking or animated display and any display that incorporates rotating panels led lights manipulated input digital ink or any other method or technology that allows the sign surface to present a series of images or displays 3 dynamic display signs are allowed subject to the following conditions a dynamic display signs are subordinate to offpremises signs monument and pylon signs and business signs dynamic displays must not be the predominant feature of the sign surface the remainder of the sign must not have the capability to have dynamic displays even if not used dynamic display signs are allowed only on monument and pylon signs for conditionally permitted uses in residential districts and for all uses in other districts subject to the requirements of this only one contiguous dynamic display area is allowed on a sign surface  b a dynamic display may not change or move more often than once every one minute  c the images and messages displayed must be static and the transition from one static display to another must be instantaneous without any special effects  d the images and messages displayed must be complete in themselves without continuation in content to the next image or message or to any other sign  e every line of copy and graphics in a dynamic display must be at least seven inches in height on a road with a speed limit of 25 to 34 miles per hour nine inches on a road with a speed limit of 35 to 44 miles per hour 12 inches on a road with a speed limit of 45 to 54 miles per hour and 15 inches on a road with a speed limit of 55 miles per hour or more if there is insufficient room for copy and graphics of this size in the area allowed under clause a above then no dynamic display is allowed  f dynamic display signs must be designed and equipped to freeze the device in one position if a malfunction occurs the displays must also be equipped with a means to immediately discontinue the display if it malfunctions and the sign owner must immediately stop the dynamic display when notified by the city that it is not complying with the standards of this ordinance  g dynamic display signs must comply with the brightness standards contained in subdivision l below  h dynamic display signs existing on  must comply with the operational standards listed above an existing dynamic display that does not meet the structural requirements in clause b may continue as a nonconforming use subject to the regulations governing nonconforming structures and uses set forth in this chapter an existing dynamic display that cannot meet the minimum size requirement in clause e must use the largest size possible for one line of copy to fit in the available space i exceptions recognizing that some dynamic displays such as those used in point of sale dispensers interactive vending machines and atms often need to change images more frequently than defined by this ordinance in order to perform their intended function and that such image changes can occur in a manner in which they do not create distractions for drivers dynamic displays with a total area of less than 160 square inches at any point of sale dispenser interactive vending machines or atm may be fully animated provided they do not
