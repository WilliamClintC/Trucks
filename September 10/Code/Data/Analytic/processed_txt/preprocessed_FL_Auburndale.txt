downy rose myrtle article 7  irrigation design standards general for purposes of these guidelines permanent irrigation system shall be defined as an assembly of component parts above ground underground or surfacemounted supplied with water under pressure system of permanently placed irrigation piping installed with and for the controlled distribution and conservation of water for irrigating any type of landscape vegetation in any location within the city water conservation methods are generally basic in nature but require that attention be paid to the irrigation system its operation and maintenance these conservation methods are not served when water is allowed to run down streets or sidewalks during the irrigation process a system that is turned on in the morning and allowed to operate all day is completely wasteful of a most precious resource since most soil conditions will not absorb a continuous application of water for greater efficiency all systems should be operated only at night or during early morning hours systems that are operated during the heat of the day are totally ineffective as the evapotranspiration rate is so high that the plant materials receive no benefit this same principle applies to windy days when an effective spray pattern cannot be achieved systems operated just prior to sundown provide a condition under which molds and other disease can be developed on all vegetation drip irrigation systems are extremely effective in selected areas for water conservation these systems are generally effective in planter beds parking islands and boulevard medians large areas of ground cover and similar planting areas these systems require special consideration since they cannot be operated on the same zone as other types of sprinkler heads because they drip water on the basis of gallons per hour as opposed to gallons per minute these systems do require some monitoring to assure that emitters and flow tubes are clean and undamaged automatic rain shut off devices should be considered as a method of conserving water these devices allow continuation of the irrigation process during short ldr10  24 intermittent showers but will shut down an irrigation system or prevent it from coming on if a predetermined amount of rain falls the only water supply for the system design other than potable or community water supply shall be an irrigation well or an approved onsite lake or pond the owner is responsible for the water supply and its protection design elements and criteria 1 irrigation systems installed within the city shall be designed in a manner which will use sound water conservation principles and techniques and will include the following 11 the system shall be designed so as not to water any impervious surfaces ie sidewalks streets driveways or patios a finished design plan is required to show all manufactured components of the working system and site features relevant to proper installation 12 automatic controls should be a part of the total irrigation system and set with a watering schedule that will not exceed a precipitation rate of 1  to 2 inches per week 13 the system should be regulated and operated in such a manner as to prohibit any surface runoff from excessive watering 14 sprinkler selection shall be compatible with site conditions water source and water quality the system should be designed to not exceed a spacing of 55% of the specified radius of any given head ie 30 foot radius head should be spaced no farther than every 165 feet and be based on established industry practices and plant water requirements 15 in turf or areas of low ground cover the system should use underground popup sprinklers 16 the system should contain separate watering zones based on the types of sprinkler heads used and areas to be watered for example turf zones should not be on the same zone as shrubs or planters as turf requires more water likewise heads should not be mixed ie spray heads and impacts impacts and rotors sprays and bubblers due to the effectiveness and amounts of water that are used by each type of head 17 main line and circuit line pipe shall conform to acceptable asae hydraulic standards in regard to friction pressure loss and ldr10  25 velocity of flow the design water velocity in a pipeline when operating at system capacity should not exceed 5

a designated area an overlay district is used to either protect the preexisting character of an area or to create a character that would not otherwise be possible enforcement of the existing development standards of the current base zoning district overlay districts exist as an additional layer of regulation atop of an underlying base zoning district providing development standards that are typically above and beyond those established in the underlying base zoning district the boundaries of an overlay district may or may not coincide with the boundaries of an underlying base zoning district and in some cases may cover more than one underlying base zoning district relationship to underlying base zoning district provisions regulations applicable to the underlying zone remain in full force and effect except where superseded herein where there is a provision not expressed in the underlying zone or where a provision herein is in conflict with the underlying zone the provision of the overlay district shall supersede and regulate the development where a regulation is more restrictive in other articles of this the more restrictive regulation shall apply nothing within special overlay districts shall be interpreted or construed as limiting the applicability of the provisions of special provisions puds clusters relationship to green swamp area of critical state concern

be required to be calculated as part of the total signage area streetside principles this section provides guidance for the design of a thoroughfares streetside and the specific elements that comprise the streetside environment it addresses how the design of the streetside varies with changes in context  streetside zone descriptions this section describes the design of sidewalks and the buffers between sidewalks moving traffic parking andor other travelway elements the streetside consists of four distinct functional zones as listed below figure 15316 provides an illustration of these zones  edge zone the area between the face of curb and the furnishing zone that provides the minimum necessary separation between objects and activities in the streetside and the adjacent vehicle thoroughfare  furnishings zone the area of the streetside that provides a buffer between pedestrians and vehicles which contains landscaping public street furniture transit stops public signage utilities and so forth  throughway zone the walking zone that must remain clear both horizontally and vertically for the movement of pedestrians  frontage zone the distance between the throughway and the building front or private property line that is used to buffer pedestrians from window shoppers appurtenances and doorways it contains private street furniture private signage merchandise displays and so forth and can also be used for street cafes 38 figure 15316 streetside zones  streetside uses and activities the basic functions of the streetside in any context are the accommodation of pedestrians access to adjoining buildings and properties and the provision of clear throughway zones and space for utilities and other streetside appurtenances in the built environment these basic functions are shared with the activities generated by the adjacent land use and general civic functions which can include  aesthetics ie street trees and public art   sidewalk cafes plazas and seating areas   transit amenities such as benches shelters trash receptacles and waiting areas   merchandise display  and  occasional public activities ie curbside farmers markets streetside functions vary by context zone and predominant ground floor land use the width of certain elements of the streetside ie the furnishings zone functioning as a traffic buffer will vary by thoroughfare type depending on the existence or lack of onstreet parking and the speed and volume of vehicular traffic on the thoroughfare 39  general streetside facility principles the streetside including the sidewalk provides for the mobility of people and is an important social space where people interact walk wait for transit window shop and access adjoining uses the streetside must be wide enough to accommodate movement as well as the important social functions related to the land uses located along the thoroughfare the width and function of the streetside influence safety and help achieve accessibility the optimal streetside width varies with the expected streetside activities character of adjacent land uses and the speed and volume of vehicular traffic in the thoroughfare the following principles shall be considered when determining the design of streetside facilities a facilities shall be placed in locations where their use will produce and encourage pedestrian activity or where an activity focus is desired public open spaces and features such as art should be located in highly visible areas including the center islands of lowspeed roundabouts ensuring sight triangles are maintained and placement does not constitute a streetside hazards b the streetside should have welldefined zones so that the pedestrian throughway is clearly demarcated c the style design and materials used in developing a streetside facility shall reflect the style of the land use the overall development while keeping in character of the overall jpa overlay district this will maximize the facilitys contribution to creating a strong sense of community identity d coordinate design elements street furniture light fixtures and poles tree grates and so forth to fit into the theme or unified style of the development scheme e facilities approaching street corners shall be designed in a manner that maintains clear sight triangles f consider vehicle overhangs and door swings of parked vehicles g facilities should never obstruct the clear pedestrian throughway curb ramps or any accessible elements of the streetside h consider the placement of vertical elements ie awning signage so adequate lateral clearance is available and does not encroach on clear maneuverability of pedestrians within the throughway zone i care should be given where driveways cross pedestrian throughways driveway crossings shall maintain the elevation of the sidewalk the use of special materials colors textures and markings alerting motorists that they are traversing a pedestrian zone is highly encouraged figure 15317 provides examples of preferred design methods for accessible driveway crossings 40 j utilities should not interfere with pedestrian circulation or block entrances to buildings or curb cuts or interfere with sight distance triangles designers should coordinate with utility providers regarding the location of utility elements such as poles cabinets vaults grates and manholes k space requirements for and access to transit facilities such as bus shelters should be included in the design of the streetside but must be outside of the clear pedestrian travel way l sidewalks shall provide convenient connections between building entries adjacent pedestrian pathways and transit facilities figure 15317 preferred accessible driveway crossings  edge zone principles and considerations the edge zone sometimes referred to as the curb zone is the interface between the traveled way and the furnishing zone and provides an operational offset to the adjacent vehicle thoroughfare on one side and the furnishings zone or pedestrian throughway zone on the other in addition to acting as the primary buffer from the vehicle throughway the edge zone is typically where underground utilities and vaults are located  furnishing zone principles and considerations the furnishings zone is the key buffer component between the active pedestrian walking area throughway zone and the vehicular thoroughfare principles and considerations concerning furnishings zones include the following a street trees planting strips street furniture utility poles signal poles signal and electrical cabinets telephones traffic signal cabinets signs fire hydrants bicycle racks and the like should be consolidated in this zone to keep them from becoming obstacles in the throughway zone b the furnishings zone accommodates curbside transit stops including boarding areas shelters and passenger queuing areas 41 c when signal control cabinets signal poles and other traffic equipment are installed they must leave pedestrians in clear sight of and in alignment with motorists views at all times this might require special setbacks for oversized equipment d retail kiosks stands sidewalk caf furniture and other business activities are permitted in the furnishings zone if the furnishings zone is sufficiently wide to maintain a 15foot minimum lateral clearance from the curb and any potential conflicts with parked vehicles ie door swings e where no furnishings zone exists elements that would normally be placed there such as benches light poles signals and trash receptacles may occupy the frontage zone to keep the clear pedestrian travel way unobstructed  throughway zone principles and considerations principles and considerations concerning throughway zones include the following a clear pedestrian throughway zones are intended for pedestrian travel only and should be entirely clear of obstacles and provide a smooth walking surface b width of the throughway zone should vary by context and the activity of the adjacent land use in no case shall a throughway zone be less than five feet 5 in width c for very high pedestrian volume areas such transit transfer points and assembly entrances and exits additional width and special design attention particularly at crossings should be provided  frontage zone principles and considerations the frontage zone is the area adjacent to the throughway zone that may be defined by a building faade landscaping fence or screened parking area principles and considerations concerning frontage zones include the following a the width of the frontage zone may vary to accommodate a variety of activities associated with adjacent uses such as outdoor seating or merchant displays a minimum of eighteen inches 18 shall be established adjacent to the throughway zone groundsurface materials differing in color and texture coordinated with the look and character of the building are highly encouraged to help differentiate general public and publicprivate spaces while providing a visual aesthetic b sidewalk cafs and other business activities shall be conducted within the frontage zone and in some instances depending on the conditions of the adjacent vehicle thoroughfare may be conducted within the furnishings zone private furnishings permitted may include seating and tables private signage and merchandise displays c overhanging elements such as awnings canopies and signage may also occupy this zone and in some instances may extend over the clear pedestrian throughway see standards for 42 building ornamentation and signage requirements within the jpa overlay district for additional guidance on required clearances d where the streetside passes a parking area a buffer such as a hedge or a low wall shall be used to screen such areas from the frontage zone and to maintain an attractive frontage along the streetside in these instances the frontage zone should be widened to provide space for a hedge or a low wall installed at a minimum of three feet 3 in height with a visual screen up to 6 feet in height utilities utilities shall be installed pursuant to all engineering standards adopted by the city of auburndale andor as approved by the city consulting engineer except as expressly supplemented or modified under this section  power and communication a to preserve the natural landscape and enhance

all development within the jpa overlay district is encouraged to incorporate low impact development lid practices into design proposals these practices help to provide mutual economic environmental stormwater management and aesthetic benefits implementation of lid practices can help to increase the developable area of a site by decreasing the size of traditional stormwater retention and detention areas examples of lid strategies include but are not limited to the following  permeable pavement a hard yet penetrable surface which reduces surface water runoff by allowing water to move thru the pavement surface and directly into the ground below  vegetated swales and landscape islands an alternative to traditional curb and gutter systems where surface water runoff is purposely directed to landscaped infiltration pointsareas along streets and within parking areas 47  greenecoroof systems these systems can significantly reduce the rate and quantity of stormwater runoff from a roof and provide buildings with thermal insulation and enhanced aesthetics  bioretention basins and rain gardens small vegetative depressions in the landscape which collect and filter stormwater directly into the ground  stormwater reuse engineered surface ponds and other catchment devices which store rainfall for future irrigation and potable water purposes small scale systems can include cisterns and rain barrels  lid standards in practice a eligibility credits and incentives for implementing lid standards may be approved as set forth in this section subject to the following which

amendments general ldr 21  5 the adoption of the comprehensive plan by the city commission included the adoption of a future land use map which is a component of the future land use element this element is one of the eight plan elements adopted by the city the future land use map is the instrument used to graphically designate all lands within the corporate limits with future land use classifications the future land use classifications determine and dictate the type of zoning district to be applied to each parcel of land within the city the individual zoning district applied to a parcel of land determines the actual uses permitted due to unforeseen changing conditions and circumstances in and around the city driven in part by market conditions and migration of people to the state and beyond local control request will be submitted for amendments to the future land use map generally these requests will be for change of the adopted land use classification on a parcel of land to a greater density or more intense land use classification petitions for such amendments will require review by city staff to determine if granted the internal consistency with all of the other plan elements what impacts such change would have on public facilities the compatibility with adjoining land uses existing and projected and if the concurrency management system conditions and level of service standards can be met a future land use map amendment is required to be submitted to the state land planning agency for either a 30 or 60 day review process the purpose of this review is to determine if the proposed map amendment is in compliance with the applicable provisions of fs amendments to the plan including future land use map amendments may be made not more than four times

intensities of uses d types of uses or units and e specific boundaries of the proposed development must be documented and verified this information shall be collected from the original development application submitted by the applicant the administrative official will then calculate the projected public facility and service demands of the proposed development and identify the public facilities andor services that will be affected if the demands generated by the proposed development when deducted from the available capacity fall below the minimum established level of service standard thresholds the proposal will be found in compliance and capacity will be reserved for needed facilities or services if a proposed development causes established thresholds to exceed the adopted los standards the administrative official shall prepare an impact statement and forward copies to all affected primary service providers primary service providers will review impact statements and determine how much capacity will be available to service the proposed development city staff review meetings each service provider that received an impact statement shall determine if and when adequate public facilities andor services will be available to serve the proposed development and present written findings during city staff review meetings if a service provider determines that adequate public facilities andor services exist to serve the proposed development the administrative official shall render a finding of concurrence and capacity will be reserved for that particular
