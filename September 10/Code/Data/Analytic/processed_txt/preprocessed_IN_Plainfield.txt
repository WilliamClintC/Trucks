land use within their jurisdictions therefore the town council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations passed 8242009   findings of fact athe flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation which results in potential loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages passed 8242009   statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to arestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  dcontrol filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  eprevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and fmake federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program passed 8242009   objectives the objectives of this chapter are ato protect human life and health  bto minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  cto minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  dto minimize prolonged business interruptions  eto minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  fto help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  and gto ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood

this ordinance the town makes the following statement regarding its intent and makes the following findings 1adult entertainment establishments require special supervision in order to protect and preserve the health safety morals and welfare of the towns citizens the patrons of such establishments and the employees of such establishments 2the town finds that adult entertainment establishments are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including prostitution sexual liaisons of a casual nature and other illegal activities 3the concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern that demands reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by the town in the specified manner in order to protect the health and wellbeing of its citizens and the general public 4minimal regulations enacted by the town are a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity solicitation or other illegal activities 5there is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment establishments because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them cause increased crime particularly in the overnight hours and downgrade property values 6the town desires to minimize and control these adverse secondary effects by regulating adult entertainment establishments in the specified manner by minimizing and controlling these adverse secondary effects the town seeks to protect the health safety and welfare of the citizenry and the general public  protect the citizens and the general public from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of urban blight 7the town has determined that current local zoning and other locational criteria do not adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of its citizens and that expanded regulation of adult entertainment establishments is necessary 8it is not the towns intent in adopting this ordinance to suppress or authorize the suppression of any speech activities protected by the first amendment to the united states constitution but to enact contentneutral regulations that address the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments 9it is not the towns intent to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material and the town recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages state law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against any such illegal activities in this state bbased on evidence concerning the adverse

minnesota  and from sexually oriented businesses an insiders view by david sherman presented to the michigan house committee on ethics and constitutional law jan 12 2000  and from various other police reports testimony newspaper reports and other documentary evidence and the town finds 1adult entertainment businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments  2certain employees of adult entertainment businesses as defined in this ordinance engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments  3sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at adult entertainment establishments especially those that provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows the couch dances or lap dances that frequently occur in adult entertainment establishments featuring live nude or seminude dancers constitute or may constitute the offense of engaging in prostitution under state law  4offering and providing private or semiprivate booths or cubicles encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions  5persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other adult entertainment businesses for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity within the premises of those adult entertainment businesses  6numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in adult entertainment businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency

year syphilis in the unites states reported annually has risen 33613 cases were reported in 198 and 45200 cases were reported   10the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990  11the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse and exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn  12according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts  13sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities  14the findings noted in divisions b1 to b13 above raise substantial governmental concerns  15adult entertainment businesses have operational characteristics that require or subject them to reasonable government regulation in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns  16the adoption of this ordinance will promote the general welfare health
