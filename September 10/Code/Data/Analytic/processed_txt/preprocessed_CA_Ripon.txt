is for flood plain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance 120  13 1116  the variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the ripon city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate     conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures in this ordinance have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this ordinance upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination by the ripon city council that the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the ripon city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the san joaquin county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  additional variance procedures and criteria a in passing upon requests for variances the ripon city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this ordinance and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  120  14 1116  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued by the city council upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a d are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this ordinance the ripon city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance     development in flood hazard zone a development of land including but not limited to development agreement tentative subdivision maps parcel maps discretionary approvals and

establish minimum standards for public and private streets constructed or improved in the city of ripon this chapter sets forth the minimum standards for improvements within the rightofway including but not limited to street material curb and gutter sidewalk improvements landscaping acoustic walls and rightofway dedication for the development or improvement of property abutting city streets   authority all design and construction of public and private streets addressed by this chapter will be in accordance with the city of ripons standard specifications and standard details the city of ripons master circulation system the city of ripons general plan circulation and transportation element and as defined in this chapter the city engineer andor designee is responsible for maintaining appropriate policies and procedures for the implementation of the citys master circulation system unless specified elsewhere the city engineer andor designee is responsible for administering and interpreting the provisions of this chapter   public roadway functional classifications a purpose the purpose of a system of functional classifications and street types is to facilitate the safe and efficient movement of people and goods while preserving residential areas and maintaining the economic vitality of commercial and industrial areas the system classifies transportation facilities according to an appropriately integrated network emphazing the movement of all modes of transportation network of streets in a safe logical and efficient manner the classification system organizes streets according to the landuse designations they serve or are intended to serve and is based on a number of features including existing and projected traffic volumes expected growth based on landuse patterns the nature of vehicle traffic and present and future connectivity and circulation needs the system is also intended to link land use development activities with transportation facilities for the optimum utilization of both existing and proposed expressways arterials and collectors are shown on the city of ripons adopted master circulation system b functional classifications and street types subsections 17 below provide a broad general description of the purpose and function of street types required design specifications for each street type are set forth in table  and in later sections of this chapter for each street type 1 expressway  these streets are designed as high capacity highspeed corridors with the primary purpose of improving local and regional mobility expressways should meet the following criteria a multilane facilities including center medians b provide limited access from abutting properties and intersections that are generally located no less than  mile intervals c rightinrightout movements may be more frequently allowed but may also involve acceleration and deceleration lanes d have a minimum design speed of 45 mph e turn lanes included at intersections 4141  f preference for traffic signals at major intersections and may include roundabouts where appropriate 2 major arterial  these streets are designed primarily to carry a heavier traffic pattern providing continuity throughout the contiguous urban area access control is typically maintained towards limiting access to intersections with other roads or rightinrightout movements 3 minor arterial  these streets are designed to collect and distribute traffic from major arterials to streets of lower classifications and may allow traffic to access destinations directly minor arterials serve provide direct access to large commercial industrial office and some residential areas 4 collector  these streets are primarily designed to provide land access and circulation within and between residential neighborhoods and commercial and industrial areas collector streets are meant to convey traffic from local streets to minor and major arterials as well as expressways and freeway even though this street may carry some its primary function is to feed traffic to the arterial streets and to provide local access 5 local  these streets provide direct access to adjoining properties within a neighborhood these streets connect local streets within a neighborhood to collector streets and to the arterial street network through trips are discouraged and parking is allowed 6 culdesacs  these streets are a maximum of 500 feet long and parking is allowed 7 alleys  these secondary accesses to the back sides of lots allow the streets at th fronts of properties to remain unencumbered with driveways alleys are an alternative to frontage access 4142 table 16142  street design table 4143   general street design standards a all streets shall be constructed in accordance

to calm traffic and enhance aesthetic appeal within a residential neighborhood d when residential properties front a 2lane minor arterial the residential units shall be designed to discourage the need for backing out of driveways onto the roadway this may be accomplished by use of circular driveways hammer head driveways alley loaded residential units or use of frontage roads e when residential properties front or are adjacent to an expressway major arterial or a 4lane minor arterial the residential units shall be designed so that no direct vehicular access is allowed onto those roadways from a residential unit this may be accomplished by use of a frontage road or a landscaped buffer all residential units adjacent to those roadways must include either a thirty four 34 foot wide minimum landscaped buffer or fifty 50 foot wide minimum frontage road f expressways major and minor arterials and collector streets located adjacent to residential areas should include design elements

sign should not obscure the view into a store or place of business    36 414  general sign design guidelines the guidelines in this section address issues related to sign compatibility legibility placement color and materials and illumination a sign compatibilitygood sign design complements a buildings architecture rather than detracting from or competing with it all signs should be compatible with their own and adjacent buildings common indicators of compatibility include  quality sign design and materials signs should make a positive contribution to the general appearance of the street and commercial area where they are located a welldesigned sign can be an asset to a building  proportional size and scale a signs scale should be appropriate for the building on which it is placed and the area where it is located  integrate signs with the building signs should be designed so that they are integrated with the design of the building signs should utilize materials colors and shapes that complement the buildings architectural style and surrounding environment new signs proposed for existing buildings should be compatible with the existing signage of other tenants b sign legibilityan effective sign should do more than attract attention  it should communicate its message clearly usually this is based on the readability of words and phrases the most significant influence on legibility is lettering style and spacing legible signs tend to  use a brief message a brief message should be used whenever possible a sign with a brief succinct message is easier to read and looks more attractive because it is less cluttered  avoid hardtoread intricate typefaces  limit the number of lettering styles as a general rule limit the number of different letter types to no more than two for small signs and three for larger signs  avoid spacing letters and words too closely together as a general rule letters should not occupy more than 75 percent of the sign area  avoid large areas of blank spaces on box or framed signs 50 percent or more blank area should generally be avoided if the total allowed sign area is not required to convey the message effectively it is best to reduce the overall size of the sign  use symbols and logos symbols and logos can be used in place of words when appropriate  avoid signs with strange shapes signs that are unnecessarily narrow or oddly shaped can restrict the legibility of the message if an unusual shape is not symbolic it will probably be confusing  use significant contrast substantial contrast should be provided between the color and material of the background and the letters or symbols to make the sign easier to read in both day and night    37 414  general sign design guidelines continued c sign placementidentifying the appropriate placement for a sign contributes to its overall effectiveness often a buildings architectural details create logical areas for signage the following guidelines help identify appropriate sign locations  respect architectural features signs should not cover or interrupt the architectural details or ornamentation of a buildings faade  create interest on buildings that have a monolithic or plain faade signs can be used to establish or continue appropriate design rhythm scale and proportion well designed signs create visual interest and continuity with other storefronts on the same or adjacent buildings  place within structural boundaries signs should not project above the edge of the rooflines and should not obstruct windows andor doorways  mark main entries signs should be placed at or near the public entrance to a building or main parking area to indicate the most direct access to the business d sign colorcolor is one of the most important factors contributing to the signs ability to catch the eye and communicate a mood or idea sign colors should be selected carefully  use contrasting color signs should feature substantial contrast between the color and material of the background and text or symbols light letters on a dark background or dark letters on a light background are most legible dark backgrounds with light lettering are preferred for illuminated cabinet signs  use complementary colors sign colors should complement the materials and colors on the adjacent buildings including accent and trim colors  avoid using too many colors limited use of accent colors can increase legibility while large areas of competing colors tend to confuse and distract colors or color combinations that interfere with legibility of the sign copy or that interfere with viewer identification of other signs should be avoided  bright dayglo fluorescent colors should be avoided as they are distracting and do not blend well with other background colors e sign materialsquality construction materials contribute to the signs effectiveness and longevity signs should be durable enough to withstand the elements while working well with the building form and materials the following should be considered when selecting sign materials  appropriate materials sign materials should be compatible with the design of the faade on which they are located sign design should consider the materials and architectural design of the building and the signs legibility    38 414  general sign design guidelines continued  durable materials sign materials should be extremely durable paper cloth and vinyl banner signs are not suitable for exterior use except high quality weatherresistant cloth for awnings wood signs should be sealed and maintained to keep moisture from deteriorating the sign signs may not be constructed from plywood by simply painting letters on wood or using sticker letters commercial grade vinyl letters applied inside glass may be permissible e sign illuminationappropriate illumination can add to a signs legibility  however the type and strength of illumination must be carefully considered following are guidelines for sign illumination  sign illumination is regulated in residential districts the following signs may not feature illumination  temporary real estate signs at individual home sites  temporary real estate signs for subdivisions  construction identification signs  use illumination only if necessary not all signs need to be illuminated nonilluminated signs and window displays may be sufficient to identify the business  use a projected light source if the sign can be illuminated by a projected light eg spotlight or gooseneck down light this is preferred to internal illumination to help better integrate the sign with the buildings architecture external lighting fixtures should be small an unobtrusive and shall not cast light or glare above the horizontal plane of the top of the sign  shield the light source the light source whether internal or external should be shielded from view or directed so that the light intensity or brightness shall not be objectionable to surrounding areas signs should feature the minimum level required for nighttime readability  illuminated signs individually illuminated letters either internally illuminated or backlit halo lit solid letters reverse channel are encouraged and are preferred to internally illuminated cabinet can signs signs comprised of individual letters mounted directly on a structure can often use a distinctive element of the structures faade as a backdrop better integrating them with the structure  cabinet signs the background field should be opaque so that only the lettering appears illuminated when the background is not opaque the entire face becomes bright and the sign becomes visually separated from the building disrupting the continuity of the faade and making it difficult to read  creative lighting encouraged the use of creative illumination when compatible with the buildings architectural style such as the use of halo lighting is encouraged where appropriate    39 414  general sign design guidelines continued  generally the use of neon lighting is discouraged where artistically appropriate exposed neon tubing may be used in conjunction with other types of materials to attractively emphasize business name andor logo  signs featuring blinking rotating flashing changing reflecting or fluttering lights or other illuminating device with a changing light intensity brightness or color are not permitted  sign electrical raceways and conduits  electrical transformer boxes and raceways should be concealed from public view if a raceway cannot be mounted internally behind the finished exterior wall the exposed metal surfaces of the raceway should be finished to match the background wall or integrated into the overall sign design  if raceways are necessary they should be as thin and narrow as possible and should never extend in width or height beyond the area of the signs lettering or graphics  all exposed conduit and junction boxes should be concealed from public view    40 414  sign maintenance abandoned signs and nonconforming signs a maintaining signs all signs must be maintained in the same condition as when the sign was installed normal wear and tear of aged signs shall

housing element goals of fostering an adequate supply of housing for people at all economic levels and maintaining both economic diversity and geographically dispersed affordable housing  464 818  d rising land prices have contributed to the lack of new affordable housing e through careful planning and adherence to high quality development standards including generous street and sidewalk widths lot setbacks densities provision of high quality parks and recreation amenities maintaining high public safety staffing ratios working cooperatively with the ripon consolidated fire district and ripon unified school district to ensure that public safety and school facilities are appropriately funded and by managing and limiting residential growth the city of ripon has maintained a quality of life that benefits ripon residents and their property values f the existing relatively high property values in ripon translate into a premium on each and every residential unit in ripon including new single family residential units and results in ripon being a highly desirable community for residential home builders at the same time ripons high property values naturally make home ownership in ripon less affordable g new development has and will continue to exacerbate the affordable housing shortage in the city of ripon as developers of single family residential projects will continue to sell market rate homes and will continue to benefit from the premium described herein h the city council recognizes that government acting alone cannot solve the regional problem of affordable housing but that new single family residential development projects can and should participate in meaningful solutions to prevent the affordable housing problem from becoming worse in addition to the measures described in this applicable to new single family residential development the city council has designated numerous parcels which are zoned for multifamily development development of these sites at higher densities is expected to provide housing opportunities for low and very low income residents further the city council has approved other programs designed to promote home ownership for lower

between the median home price in ripon and the applicable moderate bmr sales price times the required moderate units for a subdivision plus the difference between the median home price in ripon and the applicable low bmr sales price times the required low units for a subdivision divided by number of units in the subdivision by way of example 1 example with a median home sales price in ripon of $400000 a moderate bmr sales price of $250000 and a low bmr sales price of $110000 for a 100 lot subdivision 400000  250000 x 38 + 400000  110000 x 13   $947000 100 per unit c payment of inlieu fee to satisfy fractional requirements of affordable units if a developer is required to pay an inlieu fee to meet fractional affordable housing requirements the fractional requirement shall be met by multiplying the fractional requirement by the appropriate per unit inlieu fee for the affordable housing category required for example a 108 affordable bmr plus unit requirement would require 10 units
