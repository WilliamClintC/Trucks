city has an estimated population of 5810 and the county an estimated population of 17410 there are 932 square miles located in the county the city is intersected by highways 287 and 59 and is 50 miles southeast of wichita falls and is approximately 70 miles northwest of fort worth 1 the climate of the city is generally described as follows the average temperatures range between 41 and 81 the average rainfall ranges from 25 to 35 inches per year 2 the city operates under a city councilmanager form of government with the city manager as the chief executive officer the city government provides police fire electricity water and sewerage to the population gas utility service is supplied by lone star gas company and telephone service is provided by southwestern bell telephone company 3 the city is intersected by the burlington northern rock island railroad there is a municipallyowned airport with a lighted 3600foot runway the city is also served by continental trailways bus line 4 radio station kban am 1410 kh serves the city television is provided by bowie cable tv and antenna with channels originating from wichita falls lawton oklahoma dallas fort worth and sherman 5 in the event of a nuclear attack the closest probable highrisk target is sheppard air force base in wichita falls followed closely by carswell air force base in fort worth fort worth and dallas would be probable targets because of their manufacturing and defense plants b assumptions the following assumptions apply to the city 1 because of its geographical location topography and transportation conditions the city is subject to disasters such as the following a tornadoes b industrial accidents of toxic fumes c petrochemical storage fireexplosion d natural gas leaks e major transportation accidents f severe thunderstorms g high winds h train accidents explosiveschemicals i bus accidents j water contamination k epidemic l radioactive material accident m nuclear warfare n major fires o

of fact purpose and methods footnotes  5  editors note arts 15 adopted  has been treated by the editor as superseding former art  which pertained to similar subject matter and derived from arts 15 adopted aug 1 2006 statutory authorization the legislature of the state of texas has in the flood control insurance act texas water delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city of bowie texas does ordain as follows art 1 adopted 41911 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of city of bowie are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage art 1 adopted 41911 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area art 1 adopted 41911 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands art 1 adopted 41911 definitions terms defined unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common
