be charged a storm sewer utility fee beru the fee shall be based on the number of equivalent residential units erus contained in the parcel the city council finds that the eru is the most accurate measurement for determining the amount that each parcel contributes to benefits from and otherwise uses the storm sewer utility based on a study completed by an independent engineer the city council finds and establishes that one eru equals two thousand six hundred 2600 square feet of impervious surface area ccalculation the city council finds that each singlefamily residential parcel contributes approximately the same amount of stormwater runoff  therefore each developed singlefamily residential parcel shall pay a base rate of one eru all nonsinglefamily residential parcels shall pay a multiple of this base rate expressed in erus according to the measured impervious area on the parcel the city council may adopt separate rates for prds condominiums and other uses that are not easily handled under the standard rate schedule dcharge per eru the amount charged for each eru shall be established by resolution of the city council eexemptions and credits the city council may establish exemptions and credits to the storm sewer utility fee by resolution fpolicies the public works director may adopt policies consistent with this chapter and any other resolutions passed by the city council to assist in the application administration and interpretation of this chapter and any resolutions related to the storm sewer utility gappeals any person or entity that believes that this article or any storm sewer utility rate resolution was interpreted or applied erroneously may appeal to the public works director director the appeal shall be in writing shall state any facts supporting the appeal and shall be made within ten 10 days of the decision action or bill being appealed the director may elect to hold a hearing on the appeal the director shall decide the appeal within ten 10 days of when the appeal is filed if the person or entity is not satisfied with the directors decision a further appeal may be made to the city administrator or his or her designee the appeal to the city administrator shall follow the same procedure as the appeal to the director the city administrators decision shall be final and binding on all parties  85a6 billing the city council finds that the citys storm sewer system sanitary sewer system culinary water system and solid waste collection system are interrelated services that are part of a unified city plan to provide for the health safety and welfare of the city and its residents in an environmentally responsible manner therefore the storm sewer utility fee shall be included on the citys regular monthly utility bill for any given property if there is no regular utility bill for the property the storm sewer utility fee shall be charged to the owner of the property the fee shall be deemed a civil debt owed to the city by the person or entity paying for the city utility services provided to the property all properties shall be charged the fee regardless of whether or not the owner or occupant of the property requests the storm sewer utility service failure to pay any portion of the utility bill may result in termination of water service  article b storm drainage b1 definitions 85b2 prohibited obstructions

safety 101710 site requirements 10171 title this chapter shall be known as the wireless telecommunications zoning ordinance  10172 purpose the purposes of this chapter are to aregulate personal wireless services antennas with or without support structures and related electronic equipment and equipment structures  bprovide for the orderly establishment of personal wireless services facilities in the city  cminimize the number of antenna support structures by encouraging the colocation of multiple antennas on a single structure and by encouraging the location of antennas on preexisting support structures  destablish siting appearance and safety standards that will help mitigate potential impacts related to the construction use and maintenance of personal wireless services facilities  ecomply with the telecommunications act of 1996 by establishing regulations that 1do not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services  2do not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services  and 3are not based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the federal communication commissions regulations concerning such emissions  10173 findings the city council makes the following findings apersonal wireless services devices are an integral part of the rapidly growing and evolving telecommunications industry and present unique zoning challenges and concerns for the city bthe city needs to balance the interests and desires of the telecommunications industry and its customers to provide competitive and effective telecommunications systems in the city against the sometimes differing interests and desires of others concerning health safety welfare and aesthetics and orderly planning of the community cthe city has experienced an increased demand for personal wireless services facilities to be located in the city and expects the increased demand to continue into the future dit is in the best interests of the city to have quality personal wireless services available which necessarily entails the erection of personal wireless services facilities in the city ethe unnecessary proliferation of personal wireless services facilities throughout the city creates a negative visual impact on the community fthe visual effects of personal wireless services facilities can be mitigated by fair standards regulating their siting construction maintenance and use gbecause of the height and appearance of personal wireless services facilities surrounding properties bear a disproportionate share of the negative impacts of a telecommunications tower ha private property owner who leases space for a personal wireless services facility is the only one who receives compensation for the facility even though numerous other property owners in the area are adversely affected by the location of the facility ipersonal wireless services may be located on city property at the discretion of the city council with lease payments paid to the city instead of an individual property owner which indirectly compensates all citizens of the community for the adverse impacts of the facilities and is therefore the fairest method of distributing burden and benefit jlocating antennas on existing buildings and structures creates less of a negative visual impact on the community than the erection of towers kbuildings and structures on public property are capable of being used to provide support for antenna arrays thus reducing the proliferation of towers in all areas of the city lthe public policy objectives to reduce the proliferation of telecommunication towers and to mitigate their impact can best be facilitated by permitting the locating of wireless communication systems on telecommunication towers and antenna support structures that are located on property owned leased or used by the city mthe requirements set forth in this chapter for the placement of personal wireless services facilities on property owned leased or used by the city are necessary to protect the health safety and general welfare of the community  10174

limitations 10261 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to provide advisory guidelines for the city to assist the city in identifying actions that involve physical taking or exaction of private real property that may have constitutional taking issues  10262 defined as used herein constitutional taking issues actions involving the physical or regulatory taking of private real property by the city that might require compensation to a private real property owner under athe fifth or fourteenth amendment of the constitution of the united states  bsection 22 of the utah constitution  or cany recent court rulings governing the physical or regulatory taking of private real property by a governmental entity  10263 guidelines the following guidelines shall be considered by the city when taking any action that might result in the physical or regulatory taking of private real property aidentification the city should review the following to determine and identify whether a proposed governmental action raises constitutional taking issues 1does the action result in a permanent physical occupation of private property 2does the action require a property owner to dedicate property or grant an easement to the city 3does the action deprive the property owner of all economically viable uses of the property 4does the action impose a severe economic burden that is inappropriately unfair when considered in light of a the burden placed on the property owner  b the nature of the government action and benefit  and c the property owners investment backed expectations 5does the action deny a fundamental attribute of ownership  10264 analysis if the city determines that a governmental action involves constitutional taking issues the proposed action should be reviewed by the city to analyze the possible taking and to determine the action to be taken in reviewing the proposed action the following factors may be analyzed athe effect the potential taking would have on the use or value of the private property  bthe likelihood that the action may result in a constitutional taking  cany alternatives to the proposed action that would fulfill the citys lawful objectives and reduce the risk of a constitutional taking  dthe cost to the city for payment of compensation if a taking is determined  ethe governmental interest involved and its nextus to the potential taking  and fif the action is roughly proportionate or reasonably related to the impact of any proposed development  10265 appeals any owner of private property whose interest in the property is subject to a physical or regulatory taking by the city pursuant to a final and authoritative decision or action of the city may appeal the citys decision or action by filing a written notice of appeal and statement of the grounds for the appeal in the city recorders office within thirty 30 days from the date of the citys decision or action the city council or its designee shall hear all evidence regarding the appeal and render its decision and findings in writing within fourteen 14 days from the date the appeal was filed if the city fails to hear and decide the appeal within fourteen 14 days the citys decision or action is presumed to be approved  10266 limitations the guidelines set forth herein are advisory only and shall not be construed to expand nor limit the scope of the citys liability for a constitutional taking the city shall have no legal liability to any person firm or entity of any nature whatsoever and a court may not impose liability upon the city for failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter  chapter 27 flood damage prevention  statutory authorization findings of fact purpose and methods 10272 definitions 10273 general provisions 10274 administration 10275 provisions for flood hazard reduction 10276 penalties for noncompliance 10271 statutory authorization findings of fact purpose and methods astatutory authorization the legislature of the state of utah has in utah delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the state of utah does or has delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore riverdale city does ordain as follows bfindings of fact 1the flood hazard areas of riverdale city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage cstatement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1protect human life and health  2minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4minimize prolonged business interruptions  5minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area dmethods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  10272 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its
