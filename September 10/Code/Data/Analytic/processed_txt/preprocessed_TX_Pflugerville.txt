introduction and background growth of pflugerville pflugerville is a fastgrowing primarily residential community on the northeastern edge of austin texas the citys town site was established in 190 with sixteen blocks and the depot grounds for the coming missourikansastexas railroad pflugerville was incorporated in 1965 and largely remained a farmingcentered community well into the 1980s the rapid growth of the austin area during that decade began to change the image of pflugerville to that of a place where instead of crops neighborhoods and families grew with a prime source of open land located near interstate highway 35 pflugerville became attractive to housing developers looking for a place to provide midlevel housing for the growing employment centers of austin and round rock between 1980 and 199 pflugerville grew from fewer than 800 people to more than 4000 in 200 pflugervilles population was 16335 according to the census bureau the citys population estimate in january 2004 was 25480 the area within pflugervilles city limits has grown considerably alsoit currently contains 137 square miles including the citys current twomile extraterritorial jurisdiction etj pflugerville covers 392 square miles in 199 the city limits and etj combined covered 8 square miles with the selection of the final alignments for state highways 130 sh 130 and 45 sh 45 and the beginning of their construction pflugervilles growth is expected to continue as these roadways are expected to open up additional growth and development opportunities comprehensive planning and pflugervilles past planning efforts a comprehensive plan commonly referred to as a master plan or long range plan typically refers to a map andor a set of policies intended to guide the physical development of a community for a 20 to 30 year period comprehensive plans usually cover a series of interrelated subject areas such as land use transportation utilities public safety and parks and recreation the plan also serves as a basis for future development recommendations and decisions according to texas law a citys zoning regulations must be adopted in accordance with a comprehensive plan the comprehensive plan does not establish zoning district boundaries however nor does it constitute zoning regulations exhibit 11 is a list of the proposed comprehensive plan elements for pflugerville pflugervilles earliest comprehensive planning effort addressed the transportation system and was adopted in 1986 in 198 this was supplemented with a plan that addressed additional aspects of pflugervilles growth in 199 the plan was updated to include a future land use map this plan was in place until the land use and intermodal thoroughfare plan was approved by the city council on  this plan was the result of an opportunities and constraints analysis and a public input process it contained a future land use map and a document describing the planning process along with descriptions of pflugervilles future land uses and transportation system a set of policy recommendations was also prepared but were was not adopted community profile and effects of growth second only to cedar park for cities in the region for the rate of growth in the 1980s pflugerville grew primarily due to a huge influx of families with children as in cedar park and other cities in the austin region these families moved to pflugerville to take advantage of its midpriced housing and its desirable school system the 1990s saw a continuation of the trend for growth in the 1980s as the number of schoolage children grew by 288% during that decade in order to pay for more schools and more teachers the pflugerville independent school district had to increase its budget substantially requiring increases in their tax rate the dramatic population growth also placed an increasing demand for services on the city of pflugerville new residents placed a high value on safe neighborhoods parks and recreation libraries and well maintained streets among other city services in order to pay for these services the city was forced to raise property taxes steadily in the late 1990s to the point where pflugerville residents had one of the highest property tax rates in the austin area by 2001 this is primarily due to the citys dependency on property taxes which account for about twothirds of city tax revenue or just over 40% of the general fund revenue sales taxes only account for slightly more than 10% of citys general fund revenue research has shown that nonresidential commercial property returns more tax    294422 revenue than is necessary to pay for the services it demands by comparison residential property demands more services than can be paid for property taxes it provides keeping pace with the demand for water to supply the new growth was another challenge faced by the city on  the city ceremonially broke ground on the $45 million colorado river water supply project which will include the construction of a reservoir on the eastern edge of town near the intersection of pfluger lane and weiss lane this is the largest capital project ever undertaken by the city the bonds for this project will be repaid with the water service rates paid by city water customers both existing and new this financing structure is predicated on the addition of many new water customers in order to keep rates affordable economic development emphasis the trend of residential versus nonresidential growth was recognized by the city council and they appointed an economic development review committee in february of 2001 the committee consisted of key community stakeholders council members and city staff given a general direction to determine ways to achieve a sustainable tax base and to positively manage pflugervilles growth the committee began meeting with the goal of providing a vision for the future in august of 200 the citizens of pflugerville voted to form a 4b corporation an entity provided for under state law to be funded by a onehalf cent sales tax levy the proceeds of the sales tax are to be dedicated to economic development projects intended to diversify the citys tax base the 4b corporation is known as the pflugerville community land development corporation pcdc in september of 200 tip development strategies inc was hired by the city to clarify and document the vision begun by the economic development review committee their work resulted in the economic development strategic plan adopted by the city council on  the plan identifies four economic development challenges faced by pflugerville and provides specific strategies for meeting these challenges three of the four challenges are directly related to the land use planning and infrastructure 1 the use of land use and planning tools to encourage new business development 2 the development of the citys transportation and utility system in order to take advantage of emerging economic development opportunities and 3 presenting an image of pflugerville as a great place to work and live the plan contains specific strategies and actions that are recommended in the four challenge areas this update of the land use and transportation sections of the comprehensive plan is one of the strategies identified development quest and the beginning of the plan update in the meantime the council did not wait for the completion of the economic development strategic plan to begin work on updating the comprehensive plan recognizing that many otherwise wellintentioned citizens may be unwilling to participate due to their lack of understanding of the issues involved mayor scott winton suggested that a series of educational sessions be hosted by the city to improve understanding and awareness of these issues with funding approved by the city council a series of five monthly sessions were scheduled utilizing expert speakers from central texas dubbed pflugerville development quest development quest the program provided opportunities for citizens to participate in learning about the factors that shape growth and development in cities the sessions were held monthly from january of 2002 utilizing seven expert speakers citizens were provided with a tool kit for becoming more effective in participating in their governments decision making process the five sessions covered the main subject areas related to growth and development for a texas city visioning and the planning process the design of cities transportation and economic development the process of building city infrastructure and budgeting and programming city services speakers came from central texas universities private land development related businesses and other local governments the sessions were successful in large part due to the high quality of the speakers and their level of knowledge since they were also from local sources they were at least somewhat familiar with the growth issues facing pflugerville all sessions were well attended averaging about 25 people in addition four of the five sessions were videotaped and replayed on the local cable tv public access channel copies of the tapes were also made available at the pflugerville community library for check out upon completion of the development quest project the council appointed a working group on  to begin the process of updating the comprehensive plan the working group consisted of the members of the city council the planning and zoning commission and the pflugerville community development corporation exhibit 11

participation  housing  historic preservation  environmental  annexation chapter 2  land use plan element creation of the draft map the working groups first task was to agree upon a set of assumptions for the plan the subject areas included were those that related most closely to land use and transportation and included utilities parks and recreation central business district and regional planning exhibit 21 lists the assumptions adopted by the city council the next task was to create a future land use map for pflugerville in three separate teams the working group members created three versions of the land uses they envisioned for the planning area which included the current extraterritorial jurisdiction etj the three versions of the map were later combined into a single map by the planning department staff maintaining the major features of each map the working group then appointed a subcommittee to review and analyze the map further land use mix analysis in a series of meetings this land use plan subcommittee directed the creation of an extensive costbenefit analysis model for the proposed land uses using the generally understood assumption that it is more costly to serve residential property than nonresidential property because of the greater demands placed by residents for city services a model was created to measure the financial impact placed on pflugerville in order to provide services to both residential and nonresidential property estimates of revenue generated and service costs were completed the taxable values of a variety of residential and commercial properties in pflugerville were collected and the net operating cost for city services was calculated cost per acre and revenue per acre figures were generated for single family multifamily commercial and industrial uses these were then used to estimate a total cost for each land use these casts were applied to different combinations of land uses to determine the ideal mix of single family multifamily commercial and industrial uses based upon a desired tax rate this analysis and the chosen ideal mix is contained in exhibit 22 ideal mix selection of the map the land use plan subcommittee also developed a second future land use map referred to as a schematic map it contained idealized representations of how the various land uses should be arranged throughout the community arterial roadways were lined with a mixture of uses including commercial multifamily and greenways buffering the single family areas creeks and floodways were designated along with buffer zones for each also included were four major emphasis areas the central business district and three areas along the sh 130 corridor  shopping employment and tourism this map was determined to closely meet the ideal land use mix scenario desired by the committee it was then recommended to and approved by the entire working group for use in the comprehensive plan exhibit 23 was the land use map selected this map was presented at two public meetings along with some early results and conceptual layouts from the transportation element being prepared for the city by alliancetexas engineering transportation committee since the schematic map did not indicate the location and intensity of specific land uses precisely enough to accurately calculate future traffic demand alliancetexas recommended that a second subcommittee be formed to provide them with additional information this transportation committee consisted of members of the working group along with the pcdc director and one additional community representative through use of the delphi decision making process the committees opinions provided the necessary information in several meetings the results of this process are detailed in the transportation element following the first public hearing and presentation of the draft plan elements the city council directed the transportation committee to provide further review of the transportation element of the draft plan this constituted phase ii of the committees work which ended in september 2004 exhibit 24 is a timeline of the citys comprehensive plan process pfennig lane corridor emphasis area recognizing the need for a transition between future commercial development that will occur along the fm 685 corridor and the low density residential uses that exist south of pfennig lane the comprehensive plan has identified the land south of pfennig lane as the pfennig lane corridor emphasis area the area is generally bounded on the north by pfennig lane  on the south and west by the katymead subdivision  and on the east by fm 685    296422 on july 200 a planning charrette was held with 32 residents in six work groups to define development scenarios for the area the participants included residents from the area and property owners along pfennig lane or their representatives participants also included members from the city council and planning and zoning commission each of the groups were responsible for defining a future scenario for the land south of pfennig lane taking into account the existing roadways and existing and known proposed surrounding land uses each of the groups presented their recommendations to the full group for the purpose of establishing a dialogue and reaching a final consensus the following consensus was reached by the participants and is hereby incorporated into the comprehensive plan as a future guide to development within the pfennig lane corridor emphasis area  the pfennig lane corridor emphasis area should have an internal roadway for interior circulation that includes at least two connections to pfennig lane  a connector road should be established north of the pfennig lane corridor emphasis area between pflugerville parkway and pfennig lane  the land uses should transition with any higher intensity retail uses along the pfennig lane frontage and low intensive officeresidential uses at the edge of the development adjacent to the katymead subdivision the characteristics of the residential uses are oriented toward single family or townhouse style development as opposed to a higher density multifamily development  a buffer area with vegetation screening and a trail connection should be established along all of the edge of the katymead subdivision  highway commercial uses similar to activities being developed for the fm 685 corridor are appropriate and expected along the fm 685 frontage  institutionalcivic uses are appropriate in the area surrounding the justice center retail uses would also be appropriate in the event institutionalcivic uses do not occur the resulting land use scenario described above is represented pictorially below as a result of the charrette conducted exhibit 21

the operational and capacity issues presented by increasing traffic volumes current practice recognizes that the transportation system must facilitate diverse community needs and goals for this reason a transportation plan element is a strategic effort to design a multimodal transportation system that functions as a key component of a communitys comprehensive plan the transportation system must therefore be integrated with land use and growth patterns commercial activity economic development quality of life imperatives and the needs of special populations creative handling of the transportationland use connection can provide a balanced transportation system that makes it both pleasing and efficient for people traveling within the community as well as purpose of the pflugerville transportation plan element the intent of the transportation plan element tpe is to provide pflugervilles leadership with the planning tools and resources to help guide development of multimodal transportation infrastructure that best serves the needs of the community as pflugerville continues to transition from a small town in a predominantly rural setting to a growing and dynamic component of the greater austin metropolitan area its needs will change the tpe will allow future growth and change to be safe and consistent the tpe for the city of pflugerville will also make development decisions more predictable and quantifiable and maximize the opportunity for project cost sharing with both private and public sector partners    303422 chapter 2  thoroughfare plan roadway improvement summary    304422 chapter 3  policy initiatives policy initiative #1  bicycle routes policy statement pflugervilles hike and bike trail system is to be designed to provide for interconnectivity between neighborhoods and community destinations such as schools parks and shopping areas when necessary this will include complimentary bicycle routes along selected collector roadways for the purpose of providing connections that would otherwise not be possible by use of the offroad hike and bike trail system actions 1 identify existing and future collector roadways that are suitable for use as bicycle routes for the purpose of providing connectivity and neighborhood access to the hike and bike trail system 2 develop standards for bicycle route signing striping and other design features guidance the bicycle routes anticipated in this section of the plan are intended to be low cost routes operating in the roadway of suitable collector streets bicycle operation is intended to be either in mixed traffic with other vehicles or separated only by signing and paint markers on the roadway policy initiative #2  traffic calming policy statement collector roadways are intended to serve neighborhoods and provide for traffic volumes and vehicle speeds appropriate to the adjacent land uses because the citys arterial street system is not yet complete some neighborhood collectors tend to carry volumes and have vehicle speeds more appropriate for arterial streets resulting in negative impacts on the adjacent neighborhoods these negative impacts on neighborhoods are to be reduced actions 1 identify collector roadways that because of historical travel patterns or incomplete arterial connections are used by motorists at speeds or volumes inconsistent with roadway design or function 2 prioritize the list of identified roadways by severity of impact on safety and neighboring land use    305422 3 develop a set of design standards that take into account the character of the surrounding area in the attempt to reduce traffic speed guidance traffic calming is a technique for reducing speeds or limiting volumes on roadways on which vehicle speeds or volumes exceed the roadway design specifications or intended function of the roadway in a way that degrades safety or is detrimental to the quality of life of adjacent neighborhoods and other land uses there are numerous innovative techniques for accomplishing this objective without unduly restricting traffic of these techniques speed bumps are considered a poor choice and should be considered only after other more creative alternatives have been eliminated the measures contemplated under this policy initiative are not intended to unduly disrupt traffic flow or unfairly deny any property owner adequate access to their property policy initiative #3  bicycle and pedestrian crossing safety and visibility policy statement intersections that are safe for cars bicycles and pedestrians will enhance the livability of pflugerville and improve mobility for all citizens actions 1 intersections that attract bicycle and pedestrian traffic should be evaluated for their safety in particular sight distances should be adequate to ensure visibility for cyclists and automobile drivers where necessary design elements such as striping signage and other means of marking crosswalks should be used 2 design standards for future intersections to insure the continued safety of pedestrians and cyclists should be implemented these can be incorporated as part of policy initiative #4 roadway design standards 3 the implementation of safer intersections should be consistent with policy initiative #1 bicycle routes and policy initiative #2 traffic calming guidance pavement texture and coloring may be an attractive way to improve intersection safety in the community in addition there are other innovative means for creating safe intersection designs that enhance pedestriancyclist visibility for particularly dangerous or heavilytraveled intersections the city of pflugerville may consider advanced solutions such as medians or pedestrian islands for roads wider than 75 feet  enlarged or flared sidewalks that decrease the distance pedestrians must travel across an intersection  and increased length of crossing signals policy initiative #4  roadway design standards policy statement standards and guidelines that provide the basic design criteria for each level of roadway in the transportation network shall ensure the uniformity of roadways constructed actions 1 using the functional classification of roadway elements table as initial guidance establish a set of design standards that can be used by the city and developers to have consistency in future development guidance guidelines for design standards are described in the following table which was established by the transportation committee the city of pflugerville transportation plan development handbook and resource guide has more detailed information that can assist in the standards development process    306422 policy initiative #5  public transportation policy statement planning for future public transportation options is to be considered as a part of pflugervilles land use decisions the capital area rural transportation system carts and capital metros special transit service sts currently provide adequate service to qualifying citizens actions 1 pflugerville should continue its ongoing relationship with capital metro on the development of its commuter rail plan as long as commuter rail will benefit the community as outlined in the guidance below 2 the effectiveness of the existing system and the need for transit must be reevaluated on a regular cycleat least once every five yearsso that changing regional developments and the needs of the city are accurately reflected in the plan guidance any future transit development in pflugerville should benefit the community by  providing opportunity for economic development  allowing for cost increment financing or a similar financing model that would not burden the community  not negatively impacting the neighborhoods adjacent to the

provide a pleasant environment for pedestrians streetscape elements in addition to being functional and aesthetic can also identify those characteristics of a community that are unique to the area or to the specific street itself each element in the streetscape should be selected with the intent to unify the overall environment create a pleasant space to spend time by improving the visual aesthetics and accentuate and clarify existing uses in each area by reducing or eliminating visual clutter the streetscape along the cbd will be distinguished from the rest of the downtown area by the use of different plant materials light fixture color and type signage design and materials special paving materials and the use of specific design elements as it is suggested in the master plan b guidelines 1 materials should be in keeping with the surrounding character of the finest qualities of adjacent buildings and of the neighborhood as a whole 2 simple elements with highlights of color andor texture should be preferable to complicated elements that call attention to themselves rather than complement their surroundings 3 streetscape elements should be in scale with their surroundings elements too big to allow free pedestrian flow or small enough to become unrecognizable obstacles easily stumbled over are not good uses of limited streetscape space scale has much to do with surrounding elements as well as with functional uses involved 4 ongoing maintenance should be planned and budgeted for at the onset of a project c standards 1 materials shall be durable aesthetically pleasing and of high quality there is a respect for high quality materials that helps keep a watchful eye on the street to preserve the streetscape integrity 2 color is a unifying element that can be

parallelparked car doors from opening tree pit guards shall be placed no more than 4 inches high on the curbside c tree pit guard shall not restrict the growth of your tree make sure your pit guard will not girdle the tree trunk as it grows also take care to protect the tree roots when you install your tree pit guards dont forget a tree can grow to be at least two feet in diameter d tree pit guards shall not raise the level of soil around your tree filling up your tree pit guard with soil or mulch will suffocate your trees roots and rot the bark on the trees trunk never let soil or mulch touch the trunk above the level at which it was planted e tree pit guards shall never become a trip hazard to pedestrians make sure your tree pit guards that are shaped like planter boxes are large enough to be easily seen and maintain it well so that it doesnt become a safety hazard    342422 f metal and black in color tree guards shall be used to complement with the rest of the street furniture in the cbd e street signs street signs shall be historic in character materials design style scale and continuity are factors that should be considered street shall reflect similar finishes design and be black in color throughout the cbd recommended types of directional and traffic control street signs for the central business district f street lighting the primary pieces of lighting equipment are the lamp the luminaires the enclosure in which the lamp is located and the standard or pole coordinating various fixtures in terms of types and materials will help visually unify the streetscape and other areas on the installation 1 guidelines a to provide lighting that is appropriate for specific functions equipment should be evaluated and selected based upon its characteristic advantages and disadvantages b the type and size of the fixtures should be as consistent as possible along a single block 2 standards a light fixtures shall be selected based on existing architectural standards of installation and should reflect the installations architectural character b the placement of light fixtures shall be coordinated with tree locations to prevent tree canopies from interfering with the proper distribution and level of lighting c light fixtures and luminaires shall be durable and resistant to vandalism and damage from accidents 3 luminaires the distribution pattern of light on a surface will vary depending on the specific lighting application this pattern is controlled by placing the lamp in a luminaire that distributes light in a given direction by use of an enclosure reflector refracting lens or a combination of these a guidelines    343422 i a type i luminaire distributes light in all directions from the light source at a distance of one to two times the mounting height of the lamp it should be used for overhead lighting areas such as parking lots plazas courtyards and along walkways ii type ii iii and iv luminaires all distribute light to one side of the light source these luminaires should generally be used for street lighting to direct light to the street side of the lamp but prevent it from shining into the building side the difference in the three luminaires is in the ratio of the horizontal spread of the light to the mounting height of the lamp b standards luminaires used in the cbd shall be compatible in architectural style with the building or match with currently used luminaires on main street current type of light on main street 4 poles and bases light poles and bases can be a significant visual element of the installation lighting system especially in the daytime environment a guidelines they are available in a variety of shapes materials and finishes and should be selected according to short and long term costs functional considerations and aesthetic concerns b standards i the variety of light poles and bases used on an installation shall be limited ii their selection shall follow the existing architectural styles or the existing poles and bases currently on main street iii poles made of cast iron painted steel or aluminum are acceptable iv poles made of concrete fiberglass and wood are

scale and character with the setting v light fixtures shall relate in appearance to other site furnishings vi light fixture materials such as poles and luminaire enclosures shall have a black matte finish to prevent glare and minimize their obtrusiveness vii to reduce negative visual impacts clutter and potential conflicts with trees and other elements lines supplying power to light fixtures shall be located underground rather than overhead existing overhead lines should be buried in association with new construction or renovation projects g exterior lighting applications exterior lighting supports various functions on the installation including the operation of vehicles the activities of pedestrians and the illumination of various features each of these functions has different requirements for lighting relative to purpose intensity of lighting light color and maintenance see figure 162 these requirements should guide the type of lighting employed in various areas figure 162 minimum recommended illumination levels for various uses use footcandles primary streets 175 secondary streets 100    345422 parking lots 050 pedestrian facilities 050 recreation areas 1500 1 vehicular lighting the primary purpose of vehicular lighting is to increase the safety and facilitate the flow of nighttime traffic by increasing visibility of the road and of potential hazards vehicular lighting also helps provide a sense of organization of the installation and orientation for the driver 2 safety and traffic flow a standards i street lighting levels shall allow drivers to clearly distinguish the alignment of the road and quickly discern signs trafficcontrol devices obstacles pedestrians and other vehicles ii intersections pedestrian and bicycle crossings and other potentially hazardous locations as well as curves and other areas with restricted visibility shall be illuminated at a higher level than other sections of the street iii streetlight poles shall be located so they do not present an obstacle to pedestrians or a hazard to vehicles that may leave the roadway if a driver loses control if a pole must be located where it could become an obstacle to a

with the drivers view 3 parking lot lighting a guidelines i if possible they should be located in raised islands or protected by wheel stops or other raised elements ii light fixtures should have luminaires mounted approximately 25 feet high b standards i adequate lighting shall be provided in all parking lots that will receive nighttime use ii light fixtures shall be set back a minimum of two feet from circulation aisle and parking stalls 4 pedestrian lighting the primary purpose of pedestrian lighting is to extend the use of the nighttime environment and provide for the safety and security of pedestrians a guidelines i light standards with the lamp mounted between 12 and 15 feet high should be the primary light fixtures used along walkways and in plazas courtyards and other gathering areas such as commercial and community centers these fixtures generally provide higher lighting levels and a broader light distribution pattern than lowlevel lighting are less susceptible to damage and are still in proper scale with the pedestrian environment ii lowlevel lighting refers to fixtures in which the lamp is mounted below eye level it should be used along the edges of walkways ramps and stairs to illuminate the pedestrian pathway iii light should be regularly spaced but may need to vary to accommodate other streetscape elements iv where possible the light source should be incorporated into the structure of bus shelters kiosks and other furnishings b standards    346422 i pedestrian lighting shall help reinforce the hierarchy of the installation walkway network ii lighting levels shall allow pedestrians to clearly distinguish the edges of the walkway changes in direction intersecting walkways and any potential obstacles or hazards iii street crossings changes in grade and other potentially hazardous locations shall be illuminated at a higher level than other sections of the walkway iv light fixtures shall be located so that they do not impede pedestrian traffic v to provide a sense of security light fixtures shall be located to minimize shadows and illuminate areas adjacent to the walkway vi pedestrian lighting shall illuminate the sidewalk at a level that is consistent in street and conducive to pedestrian activities rather than vehicular activity vii bus shelters kiosks and other site furnishings shall be adequately lighted for nighttime use for both security and functionality figure 165 pedestrianlevel light fixture 5 landmark lighting illumination can be an effective tool to highlight landmarks and focus attention which can also assist with nighttime orientation however care should be taken not to overuse landmark lighting which may weaken its overall effectiveness a guidelines i installation entry areas monuments static displays architectural landmarks and other such features should be lighted with floodlights or spotlights creating patterns of light and shadow ii lighting attached to buildings should be minimized and generally confined to entries b standards the lamp shall be directed away from viewers and if possible the light fixture should be hidden 6 landscape lighting landscape lighting achieves special effects by controlling the type intensity and direction of light to accent a landscape feature as with landmark lighting care should be taken not to overuse landscape lighting which may weaken its overall effectiveness and waste resources several basic lighting effects can be used to accent landscape features see figure 166 a guidelines i installation entry areas monuments static displays architectural landmarks and other such features should be lighted with floodlights or spotlights creating patterns of light and shadow ii lighting attached to buildings should be minimized and generally confined to entries b standards the lamp shall be directed away from viewers and if possible the light fixture should be hidden figure 166 landscape lighting    347422   plazas courtyards and patios the cbd downtown master plan challenges outdoor spaces to become truly public places by creating comfort and amenities available to everyone outdoor places can be well adjusted to the uses expected of them if consideration of their specific place within the larger downtown is made a general guidelines 1 additional setback should be provided from the front setback line at public plaza areas 2 building indentations should be used to create small pedestrian plazas along the street wall 3 designs for new construction may include a courtyard set at the front of the first floor the courtyard should maintain the pattern of the street wall while providing groundlevel private open space 4 courtyards should have a three to fourfoot wall fence or other wall fence or other barrier constructed of materials that are compatible to the existing building or the new building respecting the architecture style 5 any of these treatments shall leave at least five feet of the entire sidewalk width clear for pedestrians b public plazas downtown plazas should be designed with public use as a priority the use of public open space downtown is often dependent on the real estate maxim of location location location therefore it is important to analyze the location of a proposed plaza in terms of the existing plazas in the area the linkage to a downtown pedestrian and transit system the primary population to be served and the diversity of potential users creating open space in a downtown without coordinating the size and use with other nearby plazas can result in declining use in the others conversely areas with too few outdoor spaces will generally be overused care should be taken to coordinate plazas with their catchment areas 1 determination for the need for a new downtown plaza should be based on the catchment area for that site the catchment area should extend for 100 feet in all directions from the center of the proposed plaza 2 the need for a high use corner location pedestrian thoroughfare should be reviewed  variety should be provided with the downtown district 3 the number of potential workers in the catchment area should be determined to ensure a

pedestrian and transit circulation patterns 6 the plaza should be linked to a downtown open space plan which provides and encourages safe pedestrian walkways c plaza function size and activity guidelines downtown plazas should be designed consideration of the function size and activity of the open space in relation to the context around it they should not be viewed as leftover exterior space to dress up but rather as opportunities to create enlivened places for people to enjoy the function could be simply a visual setback for a building and transition zone or it could be a transit stop place for lunchtime relaxation or sidewalk cafes the size may affect the comfort of its patrons and determine appropriate activities larger spaces may accommodate displays exhibits and performances plaza design should always consider the diversity of uses and activities that might occur such as passing relaxing and the need of different user groups 1 to determine plaza functions the builder or developer should include a visual setback for building     348422 b transition zone from street to interior foyer  c lunchtime relaxation and sidewalk cafes  d transit stop  e exhibits or performances 2 to determine plaza activities the builder of developer should consider a if plaza is to accommodate pedestrian traffic barriers should be eliminated between the sidewalk and the street

should be provided d consider sight lines when designing plazas for public gathering or events e active areas should be provided which accommodate public interaction as well as areas which provide a more relaxed and secure experience f heavy use across varied activities should be encouraged to minimize vandalism d microclimate in plaza design the semitropical climate in pflugerville offers short winters and long hot summers annual rainfall is approximately 30 inches per year temperatures in the 90s and above often last from may heat stored in the concrete and asphalt downtown can create a microclimate at least ten degrees hotter than in undeveloped areas tall buildings can block south east breezes and during the winter bluenorthers can come in quickly dropping the temperature 40 degrees in two hours as a result our downtown plazas need special attention to make them habitable during the summer months and inviting in the winter months opens spaces should be located to receive and encourage south east breezes yet block the bluenorthers shade should be provided by vegetation canopies and trellises water can be used as cooling element and the use of adjacent airconditioned indoor public spaces can help temper spaces near entrances 1 if possible the plaza should be sited to receive summer breezes from the southeast 2 filtered shade should be provided by means of deciduous trees and vine covered trellises which reduce temperatures in summer yet allow sun in the winter 3 continuous shade should be provided by means of arcades canopies and awnings adjacent to

minimized  provide only the amount necessary for projected pedestrian circulation and volume 6 the amount of vegetation in trees shrubs groundcovers and vines should be maximized to cool surrounding areas 7 water features should be provided where appropriate 8 consider the use of airconditioned indoor public spaces adjacent to the outdoor spaces e views circulation boundaries and subspaces in plaza design the design of outdoor plazas should consider how they will be used by people the layout of a plaza affects pedestrian circulation between the plaza and streetscape between the plaza and the building and should take into account the ability to create subspaces for relaxation the layout can enhance or block views invite people in or keep people out 1 the plaza should be designed as a distinct space 2 grade changes greater than three feet should be avoided 3 where appropriate planting should be extended into the public rightofway to draw attention to the plaza    349422 4 direct

invite people in 13 subspaces should be defined with grade changes planting diversity or seating arrangement f plaza seating urban plazas are the outdoor rooms of downtown they are the places where people gather to relax and socialize research has shown that the most important element in encouraging plaza use is an adequate amount of seating a link between the size of the plaza and the amount of seating provided has been established study of successful outdoor spaces in addition location and orientation of seating types and styles of seating and materials have been shown to be important in determination of use 1 one seat per 50 linear feet of the perimeter of the plaza shall be provided 2 a variety of seating locations should be provided to accommodate the needs of various sitters 3

different areas within the plaza h urban area landscaping humans are part of the biological world and comfort is our judge for the quality of our habitat natural or unnatural plants provide an intimate connection to this world and a respite from the built interiors of office buildings apartments and condominiums groupings of plants can create urban oases trees offer shade to help cool the city their leaves catch the breeze and respond to weather changes flowering shrubs and vines provide a connection to the seasons color texture and fragrance panels of turf provide green spaces which soothe the eye and invite relaxation native plants are adapted to the vagaries of our climate they have a better opportunity for survival in the harsh urban environment in addition native plants celebrate the unique character of pflugerville plants have requirements for growth such as orientation soil depth and width water nutrients and drainage overall design and construction detailing of plazas needs to accommodate these requirements 1 guidelines a featheryleafed trees should be used to provide a see to subspaces within the plaza b the eventual height and mass of mature plants should

interactive civic art and fountains in plazas guidelines civic art sculpture and fountains are popular features in urban plazas worldwide they function best when they promote interaction and communication among people who use the space in pflugerville we have the opportunity to select civic art which speaks to our unique character and sense of place it can tell the story of our natural and cultural heritage in a way which enriches our experience and understanding of our history 1 civic art should be included in the plaza design consider any built element as an opportunity for art such as manhole covers paving railings overhead structures or signage 2 art should be selected which communicates a relationship to our sense of place creates a sense of joy and delight and stimulates play and creativity 3 fountains should be included for visual attraction to screen traffic noise and for cooling effects 4 art sculpture and fountains should be provided with which people can interact

utilizes canopies   signs a intent signage is an integral and very noticeable part of a commercial use collectively signage influences a streets character they are one of the least expensive and most effective ways to enhance a storefront with imagination and high quality design signs can add a new level of visual excitement to the streetscape b guidelines 1 the primary focus of downtown signs is that they should be oriented toward pedestrian traffic and not vehicular traffic 2 signs should be compatible with their building neighboring buildings and the character of the pflugervilles cbd 3 all signs should be compatible with the respective architecture style 4 signs should present a clear message about the business they identify 5 signs should be consistent and harmonious with the architectural style of the property and the surrounding district    382422 6 signs should convey the message with simplicity 7 signs should restrict copy to the name address function and logo of the establishment 8 signs should avoid rates and advertising of commodities and ancillary services c standards one primary sign shall be installed and if necessary one secondary sign d graphics 1 guidelines a the size and style of the graphic its scale proportion design material and texture as well as the size and style of the lettering should relate to the building to which it is attached with the property and with the district b the graphic should be attached to the building or otherwise supported on the premises in a manner that respects the spirit as well as the letter of these guidelines c signs for a row of storefronts in the same building should be of similar size material proportion and location of the building while it is not necessary for them to be all the same color or design they should look like a familyreinforcing rather than competing with each other d maintain signs regularly and remove unused sign supports broken faded signage and empty sign supports suggest a vacant or inactive business e the letter style chosen should be appropriate to the business and the building 2 standards hardtoread and overly intricate typefaces shall be avoided e sign types signs other than those listed below are prohibited with all of these sign types simplicity is important signs should be designed in simple straightforward shapes that convey their message clearly lettering styles should be simple well proportioned and easy to read as a general guide the number of type styles should be limited to two and the text should occupy no more than 75% of the total sign panel 1 monument signs 2 sign bands 3 wall signs 4 projecting signs 5 window signs 6 banners 7 sidewalk signs f signage materials 1 wood wood can be used for backing or lettering and is highly useful for a sign that has carved recessed or dimensional lettering or decoration use wood that allows the grain to contribute to the design large pieces of wood can crack or check as they ageexterior plywood with protected edges can help solve this problem 2 metal metal can be used for backing or lettering copper bronze brass and stainless steel offer richness and durability gold and silver leaf properly applied can last for 50 years or more 3 glass the transparency of glass allows graphics or lettering painted on its surface to float in place while also allowing a view beyond glass can be etched or sandblasted and lit from the bottom edge for dramatic effects the area of glass used for the sign may also be entirely backpainted with a solid color after lettering has been applied 4 plastic plastic is most successful when used for individual letters large areas of plastic can look flimsy and cheap if used as a backing it should be made rigid or placed in a frame avoid vacuumformed plastic faces in metal frames g sign color coordinate sign and building colors so that the entire face of the building works together to look attractive and draw attention too many colors used together on a sign or on adjacent signs tend to overwhelm the viewer it is best to limit the    383422 number of colors on a sign to three or four any additional colors should be used sparingly as accents h sign contrast make sure that there is enough contrast between lettering and background colors in general lighter letters on a dark background are more legible than dark letters on a light background this applies to signage on glass or on board backing if a building contains a number of shops it is best if all signs have dark backgrounds and light letters or vice versa lack of this basic uniformity destroys the rhythm of a buildings facade i sign lighting welllit signs are particularly important for stores that stay open at night even after hours lighted signs displays and facades contribute to the safety enjoyment and visual interest of the streetscape illuminated signs attract attention afterhours and lend warmth to a commercial district exterior lights can be controlled by timers or photoelectric cells 1 guidelines a if a building has multiple storefronts the lighting for their signs should be coordinated b if all storefronts have signs lit externally with hooded fluorescent lights for example all the lamp colors should be the same ie all warm white all cool white and so on 2 standards use micro fluorescent tubes or neon to backlight solid letters or signs 3 incandescent light spots or floodlights attached to the building facade and spaced at intervals can usually illuminate the full area of a sign there are a variety of exterior fixtures that can be used as decorative elementsfrom simple housings to elaborate fluted gooseneck fixtures attached to the building and spaced at intervals use incandescent spot or floodlights to illuminate the full area of a sign 4 fluorescent light properly shielded with hoods a series of fluorescent fixtures can light signs more uniformly than incandescent spots they are typically cooler in color but new tube types can closely match the quality and color range of incandescent lights which many people still prefer fluorescent fixtures typically look more utilitarian than incandescent ones and blend less easily with historic building facades  therefore the provision of a valence to conceal the fixture is required provide a valence to conceal fluorescent light fixtures used on historic building facades 5 backlit signsletters and neon light microfluorescent tubes or neon behind solid letters or signs can highlight a buildings textured surface as well as provide a pleasant glow around an establishments name neon signs and accent lighting are appropriate to the cbd particularly to enliven and advertise evening entertainment uses that give it its unique identity neon lights are permitted in window signs only 6 updownlighting although lighting signs from below is dramatic and allows fixtures to be more easily hidden mounting fixtures above signs and lighting down avoids many weather and waterrelated problems 7 glare glare from unshielded lights makes adjacent signs or displays difficult to see bare bulbs are prohibited on all buildings overly bright signs especially at night can actually cause passersby to look away rather than toward the sign and storefront j monument signs freestanding or ground signs are seen from furthest away often from automobiles they should be used for business occupying residential buildings which typically have no sign band or display window and for businesses or spaces such as rear parking lots not visible from the street 1 monument

projecting signs can highlight the storefront and attract pedestrians attention as they walk along the sidewalk a threedimensional object or special shape often makes the most effective projecting sign merchants can use these signs to express what is unique about their merchandise or their business  for example a hammershaped sign for a hardware store or an eyeglassesshaped sign for an optometrist the information on a projecting sign need not duplicate the information on the wall sign  it should augment the primary sign by describing the business in a different more visual way projecting signs are not usually considered the predominate sign for any business 1 guidelines a projecting signs should be small and unique in character b the design should be carefully coordinated with the building the storefront and the design of the primary wall sign c a projecting sign should complement or replace the principal wall sign in a building with multiple storefronts coordinate

projecting signs should have no less than eight feet of clearance between the sidewalk and the lowest part of the sign l the maximum distance between the projecting sign and the face of the building should be one foot m the bracket from which the sign hangs should be part of the overall sign design if several stores within a building are to have projecting signs their design and placement should be considered together and in general they should be hung at the same height n internally illuminated projecting sign boxes tend to look heavy and are strongly discouraged 2 standards if the sign is

g neon tubes may not be used on larger signs or to accent a letter or logo or to outline significant building features o awningcanopy signs historically awnings served as protection from the elements for storefront activities in addition they may serve to identify a business and differentiate storefronts signs on awnings or canopies can complement or become the primary wall sign when a single business occupies several bays of a storefront a small wall sign at each bay or a sign on each awning or canopy can be very effective in discreetly repeating the name of the business more numerous smaller signs also contribute to a finegrain pedestrian experience along the sidewalk the only information appropriate for this sign panel shall be the business name address and logo 1 guidelines a canopies should be designed as an integral component of the building b canopies should be in proportion to the overall building facade and supporting framework should not block pedestrian movement c

public art the central business district has a rich heritage and history that can be expressed art public art can be located in public parks streets plazas and squares types of arts can be sculptures statues monuments fountains water features mosaics and murals when you apply the process is usually handled in conjunction with the architectural review board any public art projects in the public
