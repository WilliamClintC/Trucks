prior to the industrial users initiation of the changes 1deadline for compliance with categorical standards compliance by existing sources with categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three years of the date the standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is otherwise specified existing sources which become industrial users subsequent to promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall be considered existing industrial users new sources shall install and have in operating condition and shall startup all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge within the shortest feasible time not to exceed 90 days new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards 2equivalent limits when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the superintendent may convert the limits to equivalent limits expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration the superintendent shall calculate equivalent massperday limitations by multiplying the limits in the standard by the industrial users average rate of production this average rate of productions shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the industrial users actual longterm daily production such as the average daily production during a representative year new sources shall use projected production in place of actual production the superintendent shall calculate equivalent concentration limits by dividing the mass limitations derived under the above paragraph by the average daily flow rate of the industrial users regulated process wastewater this average daily flow rate shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the industrial users actual longterm average flow rate such as the average daily flow rate during the representative year the same production of flow figure shall be used in calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and maximum monthly average or fourday average limitations any industrial user operating under a control mechanism incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits shall notify the potw within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change bspecific pollutant limitations the following pollutant limitations shall apply to specific users in the following cases 1users that discharge or potentially discharge one or more of the following pollutants but which do not belong to one of the categories of industries for which categorical standards are or will be finalized 2if one or more of the following limits are more stringent than the limits in a categorical standard that has been finalized the users in that category shall comply with the following limitations when the following limitations are more stringent if a user has an exemption in the users applicable categorical standards then the specific pollutant limitations may be waived for that user at the discretion of the superintendent the users that are or will be regulated by the following limitations shall have three years to comply with the following limitations from the time that the users are notified by the city that they must comply with the following limitations no person shall discharge into the sewer system from any point

by the federal rules and regulations categorical standards or the superintendent dright of revision the city reserves the right to amend this chapter to provide for more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the potw where deemed necessary to comply with the objectives set forth in mmc  and subsection 1 of this section before changing the specific pollutant limitations in subsection 3b of this section the city shall hold a public hearing and show a need to change the specific pollutant limitations edilution no discharger shall increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement the superintendent may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate fbypass an industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provisions of the following paragraphs if an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the potw at least 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible an industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the superintendent of the wastewater treatment facility within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass bypass is prohibited and the potw may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless 1bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  2there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance  and 3the industrial user submitted notices as required above the potw may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the potw determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsections 3f1 2 and 3 of this section 4accidental discharges in addition to the provisions listed in mmc 1o each discharger shall

ensure that any franchise granted is operated in the public interest in light of the foregoing the following goals among others underlie the provisions set forth in this chapter 1cable services should

means an area of land that commences at the top of the channel of lakes streams and rivers or at the delineated boundary of wetlands and that is the greatest of the following widths as measured horizontally from the top of the channel or delineated wetland boundary to the closest impervious surface however in this subsection protective area does not include any area of land adjacent to any stream enclosed within a pipe or culvert such that runoff cannot enter the enclosure at this location 1for outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource waters and for wetlands in areas of special natural resource interest as specified in wis admin 04 75 feet 2for perennial and intermittent streams identified on a united states geological survey 75minute series topographic map or a county soil survey map whichever is more current 50 feet 3for lakes 50 feet 4for highly susceptible wetlands 50 feet highly susceptible wetlands include the following types fens sedge meadows bogs low prairies conifer swamps shrub swamps other forested wetlands fresh wet meadows shallow marshes deep marshes and seasonally flooded basins 5for less susceptible wetlands 10 percent of the average

subsection 5 applies to postconstruction sites located within a protective area except those areas exempted pursuant to subsection 5f of this section dthe following shall be met 1impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area to the maximum extent practicable the stormwater management plan shall contain a written sitespecific explanation for any parts of the protective area that are disturbed during construction 2where land disturbing construction activity occurs within a protective area and where no impervious surface is present adequate sod or selfsustaining vegetative cover of 70 percent or greater shall be established and maintained the adequate sod or selfsustaining vegetative cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank stability maintenance of fish habitat and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow areas under sheet flow conditions nonvegetative materials such as rock riprap may be employed on the bank as necessary to prevent erosion such as on steep slopes or where high velocity flows occur note to users it is recommended that seeding of nonaggressive vegetative cover be used in the protective areas vegetation that is flood and drought tolerant and can provide longterm bank stability because of an extensive root system is preferable vegetative cover can be measured using the line transect method described in the university of wisconsin extension publication number a3533 titled estimating residue using the line transect method 3best management practices such as filter strips swales or wet detention basins that are designed to control pollutants from nonpoint sources may be located in the protective area note to users other regulations such as wis stat ch 30 and wis admin nr 115 nr 116 and nr 117 and their associated review and approval process may apply in the protective area ea protective area established or created after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall not be eliminated or reduced except as allowed in subsection 5f1 2 3 or 4 of this section fexemptions the following areas are not required to meet the protective area requirements of this subsection 5 1redevelopment and

3structures constructed in accordance with wis stat 1v 4postconstruction sites from which runoff does not enter the surface water except to the extent that vegetative ground cover is necessary to maintain bank stability note to users a vegetated protective area to filter runoff pollutants from postconstruction sites described in subsection 5d of this section is not necessary since runoff is not entering the surface water at that location other practices necessary to meet the requirements of this section such as a swale or basin will need to be designed and implemented to reduce runoff pollutants before the runoff enters a surface water of the state 6exceptions the director of public works may waive the minimum requirements for onsite stormwater management practices established in
