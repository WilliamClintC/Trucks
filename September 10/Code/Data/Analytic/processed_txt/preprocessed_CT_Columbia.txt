purpose it is the intent of this section to promote the health and general welfare of the community by preventing the nutrient enrichment or contamination of columbia lake to ensure a present and future high quality lake resource for a variety of valuable functional uses including recreation and habitat the lake protection areas are designated as overlay zones on the residential agricultural or ra district the purpose of this section is to facilitate the adequate provision of clean water by prohibiting within the lake protection areas land uses which can contaminate water resources and by regulating other land uses which may have the potential to contaminate or down grade existing water resource quality the columbia lake ecosystem is a high quality mesotrophic dimictic lake the lake exhibits mean summer transparency greater than 4m  minimum transparency exceeding 3m between memorial day and labor day and greater than 1 mgl of dissolved oxygen to a depth exceeding 6m at all times columbia lake is capable of supplying habitat to an array of desirable wildlife species waterbased recreational activities and influences the value of real property and quality of life in the town of columbia its protection is critical columbia lake is highly susceptible to increased enrichment with nutrients particularly phosphorus because of its mesotrophic productivity state morphometry and hydrologic relationships preventing eutrophication is critical to maintaining the functional value of columbia lake columbia lake is primarily supplied with water from precipitation that runs off from land surfaces within the watershed the three lake protection subareas indicate immediate areas which drain directly to columbia lake areas which drain extensive flow paths to tributary streams and more remote areas which first drain to a large wooded swamp providing natural renovation capacity for runoff water quality  applicability these regulations shall be in addition to the requirements for the underlying ra district as designated on the zoning map of the town of columbia both the requirements of the zoning regulations as set forth in other sections and the requirements contained herein for the columbia lake protection areas shall apply within such zone in the event of a conflict the more restrictive requirements shall apply  columbia lake protection area overlay zone maps the lake

export of total phosphorus in pounds per acre per year in estimated stormwater from the subject parcel shall be computed both for the parcel with existing improvements thereon and for the existing parcel based on the completed project for which the building permit is sought these computations shall be made in accordance with the methods defined in columbia lake watershed management plan hereafter called the management plan approved 199 or as may be amended from time to time based on newer information including but not limited to basic scientific understanding of nutrient dynamics infiltration rates of various soils or ground covers and proximal monitoring data from columbia lake data for computing the nutrient export estimate as defined in the management plan shall be provided by the applicant on the site plans or similar documentation if site plans are not required by underlying zone requirements for a building permit application if the computed annual export of total

consideration of the application for compliance with any other requirement of the underlying residential agricultural district may proceed if the computed annual export of total phosphorus for the existing parcel with the completed project for which the building permit is sought is greater than the allocation defined in the management plan the applicant shall apply adequate best management practices bmps singly or in combination to reduce the total phosphorus export either to comply with the allocation requirements of the overlay zone in which the parcel is located on the zoning map or to produce a computed annual export of total phosphorus at least 10% less than the computed annual export of total phosphorus from the subject parcel with existing improvements thereon on the date of the permit application for these purposes total phosphorus export shall be recomputed with credits assigned for bmps where infiltration coefficients are available and as defined in the management plan  of 113 a worksheet provided as part of the building permit application materials will include spaces for all required input variables levels of total phosphorus to be achieved and suggested infiltration or other coefficients as available for nutrient allocation calculation the applicant will fill in this worksheet and annotate these input numbers to details of a site plan included in the building permit application package with the applicant supplied information the agent zeo will input this applicant data into a computer spreadsheet analysis to estimate the levels of total phosphorus

permissible in each of the columbia lake watershed overlay zones on the residential agricultural district lar lbr and lcr  b best management practices for reduction of phosphorus the applicant who is designing or redesigning a project application site plan may use a number of manuals or texts to find examples or diagrams of what are the current best management practices or bmps the connecticut storm water quality manual draft 2003 or as amended and the connecticut erosion and sedimentation guidelines 2002 or as amended contain some examples explanations and diagrams for bmps that might be available and appropriate to include in the building permit application site plan generally applicants for building permits can reduce total phosphorus in storm water by increasing the storm water infiltration and the detention of storm water before it reaches columbia lake to the greatest extent possible bmps shall be located between the development area or area of greatest impact and the lake
