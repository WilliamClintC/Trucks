conversions and their associated changes to land cover permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes which in turn increase flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition and decrease groundwater recharge  land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters  the impacts of construction sitealteration and postdevelopment stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety public and private property surface water drinking water supplies groundwater resources drinking water supplies recreation aquatic habitats fish and other aquatic life property values and other uses of lands and waters  these adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from construction sitealteration new development and redevelopment by the use of both structural and nonstructural best management practices  localities in the commonwealth of massachusetts are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of construction sitealteration runoff postdevelopment stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution therefore the town of topsfield has

the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3 establish minimum constructionalteration and postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  establish minimum design criteria for the protection of properties and aquatic resources downstream from land development and land conversion activities from damages due to increases in volume velocity frequency duration and peak flow rate of stormwater runoff  establish minimum design criteria for measures to minimize nonpoint source pollution from stormwater runoff which would otherwise degrade water quality  4 establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum constructionalteration and postdevelopment stormwater management standards  5 encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management stormwater better site design practices or lowimpact development practices such as reducing impervious cover and the preservation of greenspace and other natural areas to the maximum extent practicable  coordinate site design plans which include greenspace with the towns greenspace protection plan  6 establish provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural
