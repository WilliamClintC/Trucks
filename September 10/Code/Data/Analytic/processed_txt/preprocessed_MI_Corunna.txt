will have previously obtained from municipality a permit under the metro act to construct and maintain their telecommunications facilities in the public rightofway such metro act permits set forth the terms and conditions for such rightofway usage standard forms of such permits were agreed to in a collaborative process between municipalities and providers that was initiated by the mpsc and such standard forms have since been approved by the legislature and the mpsc c because telecommunications providers typically provide video services over combined video and telecommunications facilities such metro act permits generally provide adequate public rightofway related protections for municipality and the public when such providers are providing video services d other video services
