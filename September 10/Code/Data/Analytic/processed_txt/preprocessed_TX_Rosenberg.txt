should an existing outdoor display areas be enlarged or expanded prior to the end of the sixmonth period the entire outdoor display areas shall be required at time of enlargement or expansion to comply with shared parking a generally the city council recognizes that uses may have different hours of operation and peak parking demand hours the city desires to encourage the sharing of parking for its potential to reduce impervious surfaces and  or enhance the efficiency of land use thus where a mix of uses creates synergy with respect to the utilization of parking spaces due to differences in peak use the city may reduce the required number of offstreet parking spaces according to the provisions of this shared parking table shared parking allows a reduction in the total number of required parking spaces when a parcel is occupied by two or more uses which typically do not experience peak parking demands at the same time when any land or building is used for two or more uses that are listed below the minimum total number of required parking spaces may be determined by the following procedures 1 multiply the minimum required parking for each individual use excluding spaces reserved for use by specified individuals or classes of individuals except car share programs by the appropriate percentage listed in table 5 shared parking table for each of the designated time periods 2 calculate a sum for all uses for each of the five time periods columns the minimum parking requirement is the highest of these sums table 6 illustrative shared parking credit calculation provides an example of how to use table 5 shared parking to calculate required parking 3 in general the maximum reduction allowed by table 5 shall be 25 percent however a greater reduction is permitted provided that i sufficient land is set aside for each parking space in excess of the 25 percent reduction that is not constructed so that the spaces may be constructed at a later date should the city engineer determine that they are necessary  and  ii the property owner executes and records a document that guarantees that the spaces will be constructed upon written order of the city engineer c adjoining property owners property owners on adjoining properties may enter into contractual agreements for shared offstreet parking provided that there is enough total parking available to meet the overall parking requirements of both sites table 5 shared parking table use weekday weekend night 12 am to 6 am day 6 am to 6 pm evening 6 pm to 12 am day 6 am to 6 pm evening 6 pm to 12 am

results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruptions  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and g ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter and its several sections use the following methods a restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities   b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase
