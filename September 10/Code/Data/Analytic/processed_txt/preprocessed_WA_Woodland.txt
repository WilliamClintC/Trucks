type of land use are calculated and identified in the woodland impact fee schedule attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and incorporated herein by this reference the city shall calculate the average number of trips generated by a proposed development either by a traffic study provided by the applicant and approved by the city or by selecting the appropriate land use code from the woodland impact fee schedule and applying the applicable trip equation for the selected land use code in the absence of a land use code precisely fitting the development proposal the director or hisher designee shall select the most similar code and may make appropriate adjustments to the trip equation applicable thereto in selecting the appropriate land use code and in making adjustments thereto the director or hisher designee shall be guided by the latest edition of the trip generation manual institute of transportation engineers d c means a credit for the developers contributions in the form of easements dedications or payments in lieu of fees toward traffic system improvement projects identified in the woodland cfp credits may be approved by the city if the review authority finds that the value of the land or improvements for which a credit is sought is accurately documented and that the contribution substantially furthers the completion of a street improvement identified in the woodland cfp e using the formula above transportation impact fees shall be calculated separately for each use the transportation impact fees that shall be paid are the sum of these calculations f if a development activity will include more than one use in a building or site then the transportation impact fee shall be determined by apportioning the space committed to the various uses specified and computing trips for each use from the trip generation manual institute of transportation engineers g in the case of a change in use development activity redevelopment or expansion or modification of an existing use the transportation impact fee shall be based upon the net positive increase in the impact fee for the new development activity as compared to the previous development activity the director shall be guided in this determination by the sources and agencies listed above  562013   computing required transportation impact fees based on an independent fee

citys best interest to do so the city may develop its own roster in accordance with washington law either creating a single general small works roster or creating small works rosters for different categories of anticipated work if an internal process is chosen vs the mrsc process then the small works roster or rosters shall be created as follows 1 at least once a year the city clerk treasurer

condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing items ixi in d 1d have been fully considered as the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set forth in this section c variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief e variances shall only be issued upon i a showing of good and sufficient cause  ii a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  iii a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece or property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare g variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dryfloodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria except d 2a and otherwise complies with a1 and a1b of the general standards h any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation  exh a part 1996

from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall must not exceed fourfeet shown as l in figure 3 at any point the height limitation is the maximum allowable unsupported wall height according to the engineering analyses and building code requirements for flood hazard areas this limitation will also prevent these crawlspaces from being converted into habitable spaces  iii there must be adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace the enclosed area should be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event the type of drainage system will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage characteristics such as soil types possible options include natural drainage welldrained soils and

following conditions and only after submittal of a critical areas report prepared by a qualified professional that provides clear justification for the reduced buffer 1 for wetlands that score moderate or high for habitat the width of the buffer can be reduced if both of the following criteria are met a a relatively undisturbed vegetated corridor at least one hundred feet wide is protected between the wetland and any other priority habitats as defined by the washington state department of fish and wildlife relatively undisturbed and vegetated corridor are defined in questions h 21 and h  of the washington state wetland rating system for western washingtonrevised the corridor must be protected for the entire distance between the wetland and the priority habitat by some type of legal

tract dust tilled fields use best management practices to control dust these examples are not necessarily adequate for minimizing toxic runoff if threatened or endangered species are present at the site 2 for wetlands that score fewer than five points for habitat the buffer width can be reduced to that required for moderate landuse impacts by applying measures to minimize the impacts of the proposed land uses see examples in table 2 g averaging of buffer widths the director may allow for the standard buffer width to be averaged in accordance with an approved critical area report on a casebycase basis averaging of buffer widths shall be allowed only when a qualified wetlands professional demonstrates that 1 averaging will not reduce wetland functions or values  2 the wetland would benefit from a wider buffer in places and would not be adversely impacted by a narrower buffer in other places due to varying wetland quality  3 the total area of the averaged buffer is not less than would be contained if there were no buffer averaging  and 4 the buffer width is not reduced to less than twentyfive percent of the standard buffer width or fifty feet whichever is greater in any one

 pertained to similar material and derived from      purpose and nature the intent of this chapter is to promote greater flexibility and consequently more imaginative design for the development of residential areas than generally is possible under conventional zoning and subdivision regulations it is further intended to promote more economical and efficient use of land while providing for a harmonious variety and grouping of housing types a higher level of urban amenities and preservation of open spaces and areas identified or believed to be hazardous for development the planned unit residential development purd option offers the subdivider increased density lower costs permissive variation in zoning and subdivision standards and opportunities to carry out architectural themes in return for which the city realizes higher quality living environments than normally obtained by traditional subdivision development to assist in the implementation of the city of woodlands policy to reduce sprawl provide affordable housing to all economic segments of the population retain open space enhance recreational opportunities and protect the natural environment the city of woodland finds that employing a performancebased system that allots points for carrying out developmentrelated goals policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan will foster opportunities for employing more imaginative design this performancebased system assigns a point value for desired site design and development features certain minimum site design criteria need to be satisfied in order for a project to qualify for purd consideration more creative design will result in a greater accumulation of points which then provides greater incentives flexibility and permissive variation from zoning and subdivision standards  2222011   applicability these regulations may be invoked at the option of the subdivider and with the approval of the city in the ldr mdr and hdr districts provided that minimum qualifying criteria have been satisfied in furtherance of the comprehensive plan the city may require subdivisions in areas of geologic hazard or steep slope to comply with this chapter  2222011   purd classifications incentives and required qualifying criteria points a basic purd 1 a project that provides basic purd features is eligible for the following development incentives a up to fifty percent reduction in minimum lot size and building setback requirements  b flexible street standards  c critical areas density transfer in accordance with requirements of wmc b  d increased density in the ldr from six dwelling units per acre unit per acre to twelve unit per acre 2 to qualify for a basic purd in the city of woodland a development must accumulate a minimum of thirtynine points from the following development related categories a adhere to one of the affordable housing techniquesminimum three points  b provide open space & recreation must include pedestrian connectivityminimum twenty points  c provide street connectivityminimum four points  d provide acceptable structural characteristicsminimum twelve points b advanced purd 1 a project that provides advanced purd features qualifies for the following development incentives a no minimum lot size and building setback requirements  b negotiate flexible street standards  c critical areas density transfer in accordance with

twenty points  2222011   allowed uses a standard uses purds may include all of the uses which are allowed in the base zone by right with limitations or as a conditional use b the combination of permitted and accessory uses listed in the zoning ordinance for the ldr mdr and hdr districts together and including condominiums which shall also be subject to provided that sufficient qualifying criteria have been satisfied c recreational facilities including but not limited to tennis courts swimming pools playgrounds golf courses trails and structures accessory to such facilities d community halls or social clubs churches schools and libraries e zero lot line development as defined and restricted by this chapter  2222011   base zone standards the development standards of the zoning district in which the type of residential development would normally be allowed applies unless they are superseded by the standards of this chapter a project that qualifies as an advanced purd under wmc b must meet the standards of the medium density multifamily residential mdr district in order to develop multifamily residential buildings any request to deviate from the mdr standards as an incentive to develop as provided by wmc b1a must be approved by the review body  2222011   size limitation the minimum size for a purd is two acres there are no maximum size limitations for purds  2222011   calculation of density a the number of dwelling units allowed in purds is calculated in the following manner the developable site area shall be the area exclusive of streets on the perimeter of and within the site any rightofway land set aside for schools and religious institutions critical areas defined in wmc  and any nonprivate easements including but not limited to easements for gas pipe lines water and sanitary sewer mains stormwater systems other utilities or accesses b density may be increased in the ldr zoning district in accordance with wmc a1d or wmc b1d upon successful satisfaction of the purd qualifying criteria 1 critical areas density transfer the city recognizes that some environmentally sensitive lands regulated by wmc critical areas regulations have development potential if the project is properly designed for instance limited development activity may be permitted in an erosion and landslide area where the applicant demonstrates the ability of the site to accommodate development in accordance with performance standards detailed in an accepted geotechnical assessment or report as an incentive to avoid or minimize the potential adverse effects of developing within environmentally sensitive areas the city may allow density to be transferred from a constrained portion of a site that has demonstrated development potential to an unconstrained area on the same site when developing a purd such density transfers achieve protection of critical areas while permitting the property owner to retain some or all development rights and potentially save great expense of mitigating for encroachments the city shall allow transfer of density for residential uses from lands containing developable portions of critical areas as defined by wmc when satisfying all the following conditions a the applicant shall submit all reports and follow determination and mitigation procedures required in wmc critical areas regulations b in addition to the required information of a critical areas report detailed in wmc  and other sections of the chapter specific to the type of critical areas the report shall also specifically indicate and discuss the portion of the critical areas believed to be constrained but that have development potential c the report shall specifically indicate and discuss the unconstrained portion of the site proposed to accommodate the density transfer along with a recommendation from the professional preparing the report as to the ability of the unconstrained portion of the site to accommodate additional density  2222011   lot sizes a basic purd shall qualify for a reduction of up to fifty percent of the minimum lot size there is no minimum lot size for an advanced purd lot sizes shall be established as part of the preliminary plat process  2222011   criteria necessary to qualify as a purd this performancebased system assigns a point value for desired site design and development features that implement the goals policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan and other plans adopted by the city categorized as follows affordable housing techniques  open space and recreational features  infrastructure and public improvements  structure characteristics the following points are assigned to desired design and development features and shall be used when determining if a project qualifies for a purd as provided in wmc  a affordable housing techniques housing types in zones which allow residential uses are not restricted however a variety of housing types and architectural styles allowing a range of prices and rents is encouraged this variety includes but is not limited to multifamily single family duplex and zero lot line developments 1 zero lot line developmentthree points zero lot line development is one siting approach consistent with the intent of this chapter for the purposes of this article zero lot line development is the siting approach whereby a singlefamily
