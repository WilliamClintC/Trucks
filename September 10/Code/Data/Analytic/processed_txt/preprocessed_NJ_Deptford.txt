residential the next order of township street provides frontage for250 street access to lots and carries traffic having destination or origin on the street itself designed to carry the least amount of traffic at the lowest speed most housing units will front on this class of street includes loop and nonterminus streets as well as culdesacs in districts other than r40 and r20 it may include limited access to nonresidential lots but because of traffic volumes such uses will typically be served by collector roads local residential streets should be designated so that at its intersection with other streets they will not carry an adt greater than 250 where a new development will cause traffic volumes in excess of 250 adt a minor collector street shall be provided in older sections of the township where existing development patterns will yield a higher adt but the street does not function as a minor collector or higher classification of street the planning board may waive the maximum adt standard 3 minor the next order of roadway minor collectors conduct and distribute 5000 collector traffic between lowerorder residential streets and higherorder streets such as arterials and expressways minor collectors may also serve as distribution routes within residential developments these streets carry larger volumes of traffic at higher speeds their function is to promote free traffic flow therefore parking is prohibited and direct access to homes from this level of street is to be avoided some older collector streets were previously developed with uses fronting on them in such neighborhoods additional curbcuts onto collector streets will be permitted only when there is no feasible alternative and then every effort will be made to reduce the number of curbcuts by using common driveways or service roads 4 major next order of roadway it differs from a minor collector only in the 8000 collector volume of traffic it is designed to carry therefore like the minor collector parking is prohibited and direct access to adjacent uses from this level of street should be avoided in addition somewhat larger road design standards are required 5 arterial the highest order of township street it forms an integral portion of >8000 the interregional road system and conveys traffic between centers it should be excluded from residential areas source model subdivision
