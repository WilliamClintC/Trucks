interest information and enlightenment of all people of the community the library serves materials should not be excluded because of the origin background or views of those contributing to their creation ii libraries should provide materials and information presenting all points of view on current and historical issues materials should not be proscribed or removed because of partisan or doctrinal disapproval iii libraries should challenge censorship in the fulfillment of their responsibility to provide information and enlightenment iv libraries should cooperate with all persons and

libraries that make exhibit spaces and meeting rooms available to the public they serve should make such facilities available on an equitable basis regardless of the beliefs or affiliations of individuals or groups requesting their use adopted  by the ala council  amended           inclusion of age reaffirmed  36 american library association the freedom to read statement the freedom to read is essential to our democracy it is continuously under attack private groups and public authorities in various parts of the country are working to remove or limit access to reading materials to censor content in schools to label controversial views to distribute lists of objectionable books or authors and to purge libraries these actions apparently rise from a view that our national tradition of free expression is no longer valid  that censorship and suppression are needed to counter threats to safety or national security as well as to avoid the subversion of politics and the corruption of morals we as individuals devoted to reading and as librarians and publishers responsible for disseminating ideas wish to assert the public interest in the preservation of the freedom to read most attempts at suppression rest on a denial of the fundamental premise of democracy that the ordinary individual by exercising critical judgment will select the good and reject the bad we trust americans to recognize propaganda and misinformation and to make their own decisions about what they read and believe we do not believe they are prepared to sacrifice their heritage of a free press in order to be protected against what others think may be bad for them we believe they still favor free enterprise in ideas and expression these efforts at suppression are related to a larger pattern of pressures being brought against education the press art and images films broadcast media and the internet the problem is not only one of actual censorship the shadow of fear cast by these pressures leads we suspect to an even larger voluntary curtailment of expression by those who seek to avoid controversy or unwelcome scrutiny by government officials such pressure toward conformity is perhaps natural to a time of accelerated change and yet suppression is never more dangerous than in such a time of social tension freedom has given the united states the elasticity to endure strain freedom keeps open the path of novel and creative solutions and enables change to come by choice every silencing of a heresy every enforcement of an orthodoxy diminishes the toughness and resilience of our society and leaves it the less able to deal with controversy and difference now as always in our history reading is among our greatest freedoms the freedom to read and write is almost the only means for making generally available ideas or manners of expression 37 that can initially command only a small audience the written word is the natural medium for the new idea and the untried voice from which come the original contributions to social growth it is essential to the extended discussion that serious thought requires and to the accumulation of knowledge and ideas into organized collections we believe that free communication is essential to the preservation of a free society and a creative culture we believe that these pressures toward conformity present the danger of limiting the range and variety of inquiry and expression on which our democracy and our culture depend we believe that every american community must jealously guard the freedom to publish and to circulate in order to preserve its own freedom to read we believe that publishers and librarians have a profound responsibility to give validity to that freedom to read by making it possible for the readers to choose freely from a variety of offerings the freedom to read is guaranteed by the constitution those with faith in free people will stand firm on these constitutional guarantees of essential rights and will exercise the responsibilities that accompany these rights we therefore affirm these propositions 1 it is in the public interest for publishers and librarians to make available the widest diversity of views and expressions including those that are unorthodox unpopular or considered dangerous by the majority creative thought is by definition new and what is new is different the bearer of every new thought is a rebel until that idea is refined and tested totalitarian systems attempt to maintain themselves in power by the ruthless suppression of any concept that challenges the established orthodoxy the power of a democratic system to adapt to change is vastly strengthened by the freedom of its citizens to choose widely from among conflicting opinions offered freely to them to stifle every nonconformist idea at birth would mark the end of the democratic process furthermore only constant activity of weighing and selecting can the democratic mind attain the strength demanded by times like these we need to know not only what we believe but why we believe it 2 publishers librarians and booksellers do not need to endorse every idea or presentation they make available it would conflict with the public interest for them to establish their own political moral or aesthetic views as a standard for determining what should be published or circulated 38 publishers and librarians serve the educational process by helping to make available knowledge and ideas required for the growth of the mind and the increase of learning they do not foster education by imposing as mentors the patterns of their own thought the people should have the freedom to read and consider a broader range of ideas than those that may be held by any single librarian or publisher or government or church it is wrong that what one can read should be confined to what another thinks proper 3 it is contrary to the public interest for publishers or librarians to bar access to writings on the basis of the personal history or political affiliations of the author no art or literature can flourish if it is to be measured by the political views or private lives of its creators no society of free people can flourish that draws up lists of writers to whom it will not listen whatever they may have to say 4 there is no place in our society for efforts to coerce the taste of others to confine adults to the reading matter deemed suitable for adolescents or to inhibit the efforts of writers to achieve artistic expression to some much of modern expression is shocking but is not much of life itself shocking we cut off literature at the source if we prevent writers from dealing with the stuff of life parents and teachers have a responsibility to prepare the young to meet the diversity of experiences in life to which they will be exposed as they have a responsibility to help them learn to think critically for themselves these are affirmative responsibilities not to be discharged simply by preventing them from reading works for which they are not yet prepared in these matters values differ and values cannot be legislated  nor can machinery be devised that will suit the demands of one group without limiting the freedom of others 5 it is not in the public interest to force a reader to accept the prejudgment of a label characterizing any expression or its author as subversive or dangerous the ideal of labeling presupposes the existence of individuals or groups with wisdom to determine by authority what is good or bad for others it presupposes that individuals must be directed in making up their minds about the ideas they examine but americans do not need others to do their thinking for them 39 6 it is the responsibility of publishers and librarians as guardians of the peoples freedom to read to contest encroachments upon that freedom by individuals or groups seeking to impose their own standards or tastes upon the community at large  and by the government whenever it seeks to reduce or deny public access to public information it is inevitable in the give and take of the democratic process that the political the moral or the individual or group in a free society individuals are free to determine for themselves what they wish to read and each group is free to determine what it will recommend to its freely associated members but no group has the right to take the law into its own hands and to impose its own concept of politics or morality upon other members of a democratic society freedom is no freedom if it is accorded only to the accepted and the inoffensive further democratic societies are more safe free and creative when the free flow of public information is not restricted by governmental prerogative or selfcensorship 7 it is the responsibility of publishers and librarians to give full meaning to the freedom to read by providing books that enrich the quality and diversity of thought and expression by the exercise of this affirmative responsibility they can demonstrate that the answer to a bad book is a good one the answer to a bad idea is a good one the freedom to read is of little consequence when the reader cannot obtain matter fit for that readers purpose what is needed is not only the absence of restraint but the positive provision of opportunity for the people to read the best that has been thought and said books are the major channel by which the intellectual inheritance is handed down and the principal means of its testing and growth the defense of the freedom to read requires of all publishers and librarians the utmost of their faculties and deserves of all americans the fullest of their support we state these propositions neither lightly nor as easy generalizations we here stake out a lofty claim for the value of the written word we do so because we believe that it is possessed of enormous variety and usefulness worthy of cherishing and keeping free we realize that the application of these propositions may mean the dissemination of ideas and manners of expression that are repugnant to many persons we do not state these propositions in the comfortable belief that what people read is unimportant we believe rather that what people read is deeply important  that ideas can be dangerous  but that the suppression of ideas is fatal to a democratic society freedom itself is a dangerous way of life but it is ours 40 this statement was originally issued in may of 1953 by the westchester conference of the american library association and the american book publishers council which in 1970 consolidated with

duly noticed and duly held session of the said superintendent and selectmen bristol new hampshire by board of selectmen ______________________________ ______________________________ _______________________________ town of bristol new hampshire winter and inclement weather policy and priorities pursuant to rsa a the bristol board of selectmen hereby establishes the following policy and procedure for winter and inclement weather road maintenance policy objectives 1 objective the town of bristol seeks to provide timely efficient and costeffective winter maintenance snow removal and ice control on the towns public highways bridges and sidewalks for the safety and benefit of the towns residents and the general motoring and pedestrian public 2 procedure the objective stated in may best be achieved by implementation and execution of the procedures and tasks outlined in of this policy the towns winter operations snow removal and ice control procedures due to the many variables that are inherent in new england weather each storm or weather event may require slightly different effort or emphasis on any number of maintenance tasks which together determine the overall winter maintenance snow removal or ice control strategy 3 level of service it is not reasonably possible to maintain a snow and icefree road or sidewalk during a storm the town intends to utilize its best efforts within the means available to provide practical safe access to homes businesses and municipal and other public facilities during and after winter storms a as a general policy the town will start to conduct snow removal operations upon accumulations of 2 inches of snowfall the road agent may at his or her discretion based upon weather information reports or prevailing conditions elect to not remove snow until greater or lesser amounts have accumulated b notwithstanding any other provision of this policy snow removal or road or sidewalk treatment operations may be suspended at any time when continuing operations would pose a hazard to persons or property c pretreatment and ice control may be implemented prior to during or after a storm as determined to be most effective noting that salt has a much slower effect on melting snow and ice at temperatures below 25 degrees fahrenheit and thus may not be applied until it is warmer d sidewalk snow clearance will be conducted as soon as possible during winter storms subject to availability of personnel and the need to maintain safe roadways will generally take priority property owners may assist the town in sidewalk safety by clearing snow from sidewalks in front of their properties provided that the snow so removed is not placed in the streets 4 direction the bristol road agent or the road agents designee shall direct all winter maintenance activities for the town 5 implementation this policy including the standard operating procedures set forth in is intended to serve as the normal procedure for winter maintenance snow removal and ice control for the town of bristol one or more of the following events or circumstances which may delay or prevent the implementation of this policy may affect all or any part of normal operating procedures  equipment breakdown  snow accumulation in excess of one inch per hour  freezing rain or other icing conditions  traffic congestion  emergencies  personnel illness  other events beyond the reasonable control of the town 6 notice this policy may be posted in appropriate public places in the town as determined by the selectmen all residents are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the contents hereof as it describes conditions that one might expect to encounter before during and after a winter storm event 7 adoption this policy and the accompanying encompassing standard operating procedures have been adopted by the bristol board of selectmen on __________ 2005 town of bristol nh winter operations standard snow removal and ice control procedures includes public highways bridges sidewalks and parking areas 1 equipment and personnel the assets available for winter snow removal and ice control are established within the parameters of the annual budget approved by the town in formulating the budget the town seeks to allocate sufficient funds for this purpose but variable weather conditions may make budget projections inaccurate when weather conditions require additional funds beyond those available in the budget the town will undertake such actions as are reasonably necessary to address such conditions but the town is bound by law to follow certain legal requirements and procedures that may delay the immediate availability of funds for responses the highway department utilizes available assets of the department as needed to address snow emergencies the town of bristol has 5 fulltime personnel available for winter maintenance operations and contracts with independent plowing services for additional plowing as appropriate 2 routes currently the town is divided into 4 major plow andor treatment routes as specified in appendix a the towns available equipment is assigned to a plow route as stated in appendix a the town uses a backhoe to load trucks during winter operations this backhoe is also used to load snow or push back snow at intersections to create better lines of sight plow routes may be altered from time to time for more efficient snow removal or cost efficiencies the road agent shall notify the town administrator and relevant personnel of such changes limited temporary changes made in accordance with this section do not require approval of the town administrator or board of selectmen unless specifically advised to the contrary 2 3 materials the town bases its annual budget for snow removal materials in part on past usage and estimated weather forecasts in recent years the department has used approximately 500 tons of rock salt or other deicing agent and 2000 cubic yards of sand each season the sand is used as an abrasive and is applied to the road to improve traction for motor vehicles salt is employed as deicing and antiicing agent the estimated annual supply of sand is purchased each year mixed with salt and stockpiled inside the highway departments storage building rock salt is purchased as needed with a limited quantity of approximately 60 tons stockpiled by the highway department unless weather conditions require a different approach winter maintenance routes are treated with a mixture of sand and salt generally with a minimum amount of salt to prevent freezing of the mixture the mixture may be adjusted according to the nature of the storm with additional salt if needed the mixture is applied to the traveled way at the beginning and at the conclusion of a storm salt may also be applied to the center of paved roads where traffic traveling in either direction can work the material the salt in conjunction with traffic action creates a solution intended to assist in melting snow and ice and resisting snow and ice packing on the roadway the road crown further assists with the spreading of the mixture the sandsalt mixture as well as salt itself is effective only to approximately 25 degrees fahrenheit other deicing agents may be effective to lower temperatures but cost and need for specialized equipment have forestalled their use at this time 4 communications the majority of the public works rolling stock is equipped with vhf band radios each plow and equipment operator is assigned a unique call number radios are also maintained at the highway department garage and each operator may communicate with the town police and fire departments 5 schools a the town is not responsible for clearing of snow and winter treatment of the school parking lot on days when school is in session winter road maintenance efforts are timed to coincide with bus routing and delivery of students to the extent reasonably practicable b school cancellation the school superintendent or designated official representative may contact the road agent or highway departments designee to determine the condition of the municipalitys roads in order to determine the advisability of students using school buses the school representatives shall make the decision to cancel or postpone school for that day 6 parking the town has adopted winter parking regulations one purpose of this winter parking ban is to allow winter maintenance crews unobstructed snow removal and ice control routes as much as possible to maintain the maximum effectiveness of their efforts 7 plow route priorities with a total of approximately 35 miles of roads from which to remove snow and control ice and having available only the equipment specified in appendix b to handle this activity the highway department has to assign priorities for winter maintenance route activity in order to maximize the effectiveness of its efforts in accordance with the following a school bus routes school bus routes are given first priority on school days plow routes are designed with the intent to provide snow clearing with one hour of the regular school bus schedule for that route b public parking areas the public parking area at the town office will be plowed and skid resistant material will be applied as needed c fire department the fire station property will be plowed and skid resistant material will be applied as needed d transfer stationrecycling center transfer station personnel may be required to assist with the towns general winter maintenance operations if the facility is open during a stormwinter event the highway department will plow the 3 facility as part of a plow route if the facility is not open it will be plowed as conditions and available resources warrant transfer station attendants will attempt to keep public areas reasonably clear of snow and ice and maintain them with sand and other slip resistant materials recognizing that it will often not be possible to maintain grounds free and clear of ice and snow e specific plow routes for the town are listed in appendix a  however the routes their priority and the timing of activities are all subject to variation or not being following or implemented as conditions warrant 8 roads and sidewalks not receiving winter maintenance the town of bristol does not maintain a number of roadways sidewalks and other areas as part of its winter maintenance activities the areas not maintained by the town include a class vi roads b private roads driveways and sidewalks c roads sidewalks and other areas maintained or within the jurisdiction of state federal or other units of government 4 9 damage to private property the descriptions of immunity and potential liability in this section are not intended to waive any immunity or to extend any liability that may exist under law  but are intended solely for convenience a the town of bristol assumes no responsibility for damage to private property that is located within the public rightofway as such property is deemed an encumbrance that is not permitted to be located in the rightofway the rightofway is often 50 wide and land within the rightofway may be mistaken by property owners as their own property in many cases the rightofway may extend 10 to 20 either side of the paved or graveled surface of a road homeowners sometimes may extend lawns plant trees or shrubbery place mailboxes or erect fences or stonewalls in these areas which might be intended to improve appearance but which may obstruct or interfere with maintenance being conducted on the roadway including winter maintenance b in the event of property damage occurring as a result of winter maintenance activities conducted by the town of bristol the town may be held responsible only for damages as allowed by law arising from negligence or other fault properly attributable to the town in any event the town will not be responsible for the repair or replacement of damaged property that is within the public rightofway whether located on private or public property or which is the result of negligence or fault attributable to others c the town will also not be responsible for damage to any vehicle which may be damaged during winter maintenance if the vehicle is parked in violation of any state law or local regulation including any winter or snow removal parking limitation periods or is otherwise improperly or imprudently located or operated 10 placement of snow in rightofway no snow is to be shoveled blown plowed or placed by any means onto town streets or sidewalks or across roadways to the opposite side snow banks unless it is immediately cleaned up and removed so as to eliminate any hazard or danger to the public or to town vehicles 11 roadway obstructions if any pedestrian or vehicle or other item interferes with snow removal operations the towns personnel will seek the cooperation of the person or the owner of such item to remove it immediately if the owner cannot be readily located or if the owner refuses to cooperate the town vehicle operator shall contact the town police department for assistance operators should not attempt to confront owners with regard to such matters 12 post storm operations as determined by the road agent snow banks resulting from previous accumulations may be pushed back or shelved using the plow and wing of suitable equipment to make space for future snow storms 13 snow removal from town roads during the initial stages of a storm town highways will be plowed and receive surface treatment as appropriate in accordance herewith as parked vehicles are removed from streets snow removal equipment may swing wider street to push back accumulated snow a any vehicles which violate winter parking regulations are subject to ticketing and towing any vehicle which otherwise interferes with the reasonable efforts of the towns winter maintenance is subject to removal after reasonable attempt to notify the operator if possible b snow removal operations may be delayed or ended in areas where vehicles are improperly parked or where they might interfere with snow removal operations c the town is not responsible for damages to such vehicles arising out of winter maintenance operations or as a result of towing 14 sidewalk snow removal a sidewalk snow clearance generally will not begin until all other street snow removal operations are in progress 5 b if sufficient personnel are not available to conduct sidewalk snow removal operations as well as street clearance the streets shall take priority 6 4 sample agreement for independent snow plow contractors note this sample is provided as an
