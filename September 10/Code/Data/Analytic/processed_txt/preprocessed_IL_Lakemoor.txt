objectives of this chapter relating to the public health safety and welfare can be achieved without the literal application of the detailed zoning and subdivision requirements otherwise applicable  and 2special amenities and benefits to the community beyond those required by this and other village ordinances can be achieved by allowing more flexible design than is otherwise permitted by village zoning and subdivision regulations bthese objectives can be achieved where a substantial area of land is planned for development as an integrated unit where its design is subject to more detailed review and approval by the village than is normally required cthe objective if planned unit development pud is therefore not simply to allow exceptions to otherwise applicable regulations it is instead to encourage a higher level of design and amenity than it is possible to achieve under the usual land developments requirements dit is therefore the intent of the village to suspend the application of detailed zoning and subdivision standards as provided herein only where such special amenity is achieved in this way the village may grant the creative developer as desirable

apply 1special circumstances not found elsewhere special circumstances fully described in the written findings exist that are peculiar to the property for which the variance is sought ad that do not apply generally to other properties in the same zoning district and these circumstances are not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make it reasonably practical to provide a general regulation to cover them 2circumstances relate to the property only since a variance will affect the character of its surroundings long after a property changes hands the special circumstances referenced herein relate only to the physical character of the land or buildings for which a variance is sought such as dimensions topography or soil conditions they do not concern any business or activity the present or prospective owner or tenant carries on or seeks to carry on therein nor to the personal business or financial circumstances of such owner or tenant or any other party with interest in the property

4unnecessary hardships for reasons fully set forth in the written findings the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary and undue hardship upon the applicant as distinguished from mere inconvenience 5preserves rights conferred by district a variance is necessary for the applicant to preserve and enjoy a substantial property right possessed by other properties in the same zoning district and does not confer a special privilege ordinarily denied to other properties in the district 6necessary for use of property the grant of a variance is necessary not because it will increase the applicants economic return although it may have this effect but because without a variance the applicant will be deprived of any reasonable use or enjoyment of the property 7not alter character the granting of the variance will not alter the essential character of the locality nor substantially impair environmental quality property values or public safety or welfare in the vicinity 8consistent with ordinance and plan the granting of a variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter and of the comprehensive plan of the

continuation and under appropriate circumstances elimination of existing uses of property that do not conform to the requirements of this chapter or that may not conform to future amendments thereto bthe provisions in this subchapter are designed to accomplish this intent in a way that 1recognizes the rights and interests of owners of individual properties that have been rendered nonconforming by village action to upgrade zoning policies and standards  2allows the property owner or lessee to recover his or her investment in the nonconformity while also recognizing that by virtue of the nonconformity he or she enjoys a special right not available to other property owners in the same zoning district  and 3minimizes the nuisance reduction in neighboring property values and other adverse effects of properties that do not conform to their environs passed 8211953  o036 passed 1181990  o36 passed 11142014   types of nonconformities aa nonconformity is any characteristic of a building structure or lot or parcel of land or of the use thereof which was lawful prior to the date of enactment of this chapter or any amendment thereto but that does not currently conform to the requirements applicable to the zoning district in which it is located bthe lawful issuance of a building permit prior to the dates specified above shall be considered to establish the lawfulness of any building or structure cthere are three categories of nonconformities 1activity nonconformities aa property with an activity nonconformity is being used for a purpose not allowed in its zoned district bactivity nonconformities are any activities or functions carried on at a premises as either a principal or accessory use that are not allowed by the permitted and conditional uses of the zoning district in which the premises is situated irrespective of the use for which the premises was designed cthe use of a dwelling now located in a residential district as the site of a previously legal business is an example of an activity nonconformity the design if such a structure is conforming but its use is not dthe provisions herein recognize that activity nonconformities can generally be eliminated more easily and at less cost than other kinds of nonconformities 2design nonconformities aa property with a design nonconformity was designed for a purpose not allowed in its zoning district its present use may or may not be for a purpose allowed in that district ba design nonconformity is the design or intended use of all or substantially all of a premises for any principal or accessory use not allowed by the permitted and conditional uses of the zoning district in which it is located irrespective of the nature of the activities currently carried on at that premise ca previously legal premises now located in a residential district that was designed and intended as an automobile service station or an open sales lot would be an example of a design nonconformity even if no service station or sales business were currently operated on the premises a store building in a residential district presently used as an elementary school would be another example in both cases
