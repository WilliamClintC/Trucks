point source unless authorized by a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit improving water quality under this program focused on industrial wastewater and municipal sewage discharges once the united states environmental protection agency epa found an improvement in pollution control of these point source discharges it shifted its regulatory focus to nonpoint source pollution namely urban stormwater runoff a series of studies in the 1980s identified many pollutants in stormwater discharges from a variety of sources including streets parking lots lawns construction sites highway yards and other urban commercial and industrial uses as a result in 1990 the epa established phase i stormwater regulations for large communities with populations greater than 100000 which required nationalstate pollution discharge elimination system nspdes permits for certain municipal and industrial stormwater discharges in 1991 phase ii of these regulations was finalized requiring smaller communities within urbanized areas to develop plans for the control of stormwater within their jurisdictions by march 200 with implementation by 2008 2 the village of malverne as an operator of a municipal separate stormwater system ms4 is subject to these permitting requirements as the state of new york department of environmental conservation has designated the village as an automatically designated urbanized area the initial step toward providing a stormwater pollution prevention plan under phase ii is to develop and implement six minimum measures including public education public involvement detection and elimination of illicit connections construction site runoff postconstruction stormwater controls pollution prevention and good housekeeping this chapter is intended to meet a number of these measures the various provisions of this chapter work to meet these objectives by regulating the impacts of construction activity in the village on soil  50030 general provisions  5071  erosion and stormwater runoff for most singlefamily residences stormwater runoff is managed with the installation of dry wells catch basins driveway andor curtain drains or piping to nearby existing municipal storm sewer systems typical erosion control measures include the installation of silt fences and hay bales around the property during construction 3 this chapter acknowledges the difference between large construction projects typically requiring planning board site plan or subdivision approval and more modest additions or improvements by requiring more detailed information for the large projects and basic information for the smaller projects b findings the board of trustees of the village of malverne finds that uncontrolled drainage and runoff associated with land development have a significant impact upon the health safety and welfare of the community specifically 1 stormwater runoff can carry pollutants into receiving water bodies degrading water quality 2 the increase in nutrients in stormwater runoff such as phosphorus and nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of receiving waters 3 improper design and construction of drainage facilities can increase the velocity of runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation 4 construction involving land clearing and the alteration of natural topography increases erosion 5 siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases their capacity to hold and transport water interferes with navigation in downstream harbors and harms flora and fauna 6 sediment from soil erosion clogs catch basins storm sewers and ditches and pollutes and silts streams rivers lakes reservoirs and harbors 7 impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff and allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow 8 improperly managed stormwater runoff can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur endangering property and human life 9 substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on community waters 10 many future problems can be avoided if land is developed with sound stormwater runoff management practices  5071 malverne code  5072   5072 purpose and objectives in order to protect maintain and enhance both the immediate and longterm health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the village of malverne this chapter has the following objectives in accordance with certain measures identified in the spdes phase ii

administer such local law  5074 definitions and word usage a to prevent increases in the magnitude and frequency of stormwater runoff so as to prevent an increase in flood flows and in the hazards and costs associated with flooding b to prevent decreases in groundwater recharge and stream base flow so as to maintain aquatic life assimilative capacity and potential water supplies c to maintain the integrity of stream geometry so as to sustain the hydrologic functions of streams d to control erosion and sedimentation so as to prevent its deposition in streams and other receiving water bodies e

no retaining wall may be constructed in a front yard a purpose the board of trustees hereby determines that in a community such as the village of malverne comprised principally of onefamily homes the aesthetic impact of large parabolic or hemispheric discs or other similar antennas or devices measuring several feet in diameter can be offensive to the residential community and be inconsistent with the character of the neighborhood if unregulated such devices can be disruptive to the appearance of the skyline and disrupt the pleasant nature and character of the community also the interests of public safety require that such devices be installed in accordance with welldefined engineering standards and other safety measures such as fencing around the base may be necessary these aesthetic and safety concerns do not arise in connection with dipole antennas which blend into the skyline the board also finds that a regulatory scheme such as is set forth herein allows a reasonable balancing of the needs of the community and the rights of persons to reasonable access to television or radio stations that they desire and to allow such antennas to fit into the character of the community b permits  when required no person shall cause suffer or permit the erection construction installation relocation andor maintenance of any parabolic or hemispheric disc or satellite receiveonly antenna
