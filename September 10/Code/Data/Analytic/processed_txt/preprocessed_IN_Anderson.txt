on work performance and personal conduct to work well with their fellow employees and to do all the things that contribute to good performance and reaching agency goals so long as employee behavior is positive and supportive of organizational goals all is well but when employee behavior departs for the norm or the standard set by the city the need for disciplinary action arises corrective discipline referred to as progressive discipline is based on the belief that discipline should serve to correct unsatisfactory behavior it shows the employee that he has violated the accepted work policy of the city this is especially important as positive discipline because it will in most cases allow the employee to correct his behavior the basic steps personnel policies and procedures 81 that reflect this principle are written reprimand suspension without pay demotion and termination however there are exceptions to these basic steps and they demand on the nature or severity of the infractions there are three basic types of infractions group i group ii and group iii 1 group i infractions are offenses of the least severe type the progressive steps that follow this type of infraction are reprimands suspension without pay and demotion or termination 2 group ii an infraction that warrants more than a reprimand will result in suspension without pay as the first disciplinary step 3 group iii the most severe type of infractions such offenses because of the severity could result in indefinite suspension or termination or demotion as determined by the department head and personnel director b all disciplinary actions must be in writing the original must be submitted to the personnel department with copies going to the supervisor and the employee a suspension demotion or termination cannot occur without the record of disciplinary action submitted to the personnel department c if in   an action is not listed consultation between the department head and personnel director will determine the group placement for the infraction res 1489 passed 3989  am res 4392 passed 91092   actions subjecting employee to disciplinary procedures these are only examples

removal of lowest branches to a prescribed height for appropriate clearance needs generally eight feet over sidewalks 14 feet over streets and a variety of heights for mower clearance only if needed b pruning trees natural target pruning the practice of natural target pruning makes use of the branch collar to identify the proper location to remove a branch but there is a threecut process that must be used to remove branches in order to preserve the bark tissue and the branch collar see figures b4 and b5 1 the first cut marked a in figures below is an undercut about onefourth branch made upward from the bottom of the branch about one or two inches farther out than the collar 2 the second cut marked b in figures below is a downward cut just outside the undercut that actually removes the entire branch eliminating the weight of the branch before making the final natural target cut 3 the third cut marked cd in figures below is the natural target cut the remaining portion of the stub is removed with a cut made just outside of the branch collar tissue 4 the american national standard for tree pruning is ansi a300 the american national standards institute approved its development process this pruning standard should be followed where possible in all pruning situations to remain consistent with industry standards please note that the a300 standard has been 2010 s7 trees 104m drafted to address pruning specifications across all geographic areas knowledge of the growth habits of certain tree species within a given environment may alter how the recommendations of a300 are interpreted pruning types a300 provides two basic objectives hazard reduction pruning hrp is recommended when the primary objective is to reduce the danger to a specific target caused by visibly defined hazards in a tree for example hrp may be the primary objective if a tree had many dead limbs over a park bench maintenance pruning mp is recommended when the primary objective is to maintain or improve tree health and structure and includes hazard reduction pruning an example here might be to perform a mp operation on a front yard tree hrp and mp should consist of one or more of the pruning types noted below crown cleaning shall consist of the selective removal of one or more of the following items dead dying or diseased branches weak branches and watersprouts crown thinning shall consist of the selective removal of branches of increase light penetration air movement and reduce weight crown raising shall consist of the removal of the lower branches of a tree to provide clearance crown reduction or crown shaping decreases the height andor spread of a tree consideration should be given to the ability vista pruning is selective thinning of framework limbs or specific

the trunk shall be clear of mulch general information although topping trees is a common practice in many communities it is not a professional method for pruning trees it is not a practice that should be performed by any certified arborist because there are professional pruning techniques to limit the height of a tree topping practices do not follow the rules of pruning that protect the branch collars or that stipulate size limits for pruning to lateral branches thus they are not made in a professional manner and leave stubs of branches in the canopy these stubs are not protected from decay organisms and open the tree to invasion by insects and decay this decay can penetrate to the lower branches and trunk of the tree and cause its rapid decline and possibly death these problems are shown in figure 73 topping or rounding over is mistakenly believed to control the height of a tree however the new stems will soon grow to be the same height as the tree is genetically programmed to be but the new stems will be numerous and crowded and weakly attached at the point of topping many of these will die back and fall off during windy weather passed 111209 2010 s7 trees 104o appendix c planting standards for city trees and shrubs accepted tree planting techniques a the hole should be no deeper than the root ball b the hole should be three to four times wider than the root ball c mulch should cover the entire planting hole but not be piled onto the trunk of the tree d contrary to popular belief the burlap material should be removed because it may not dissolve below ground the best suggestion is to remove all of the burlap but at the least the top third of the burlap should be cut off to allow new roots to grow unobstructed the biggest difference from previous planting diagrams is the hole itself that has the shape of a shallow basin e the hole is only as deep as the root ball this provides a firm base that will keep the tree from settling to submerge the trunk flare f the hole is three to four times wider than the root mass this prepares a loosened and aerated soil in the area that the new roots will grow g a small water retaining berm is placed at the edge of the hole to help hold irrigation water in the root zone h the mulch is applied over the entire transplanting hole this will help retain moisture in the root zone and possibly protect the trunk from mower damage the mulch is applied neither onto the trunk flare nor up onto the trunk mulch on the trunk can allow the bark to decay and make the tree likely to become diseased or rot i the hole is only as deep as the root ball this provides a firm base that will keep the tree from settling to submerge the trunk flare 2010 s7 104p anderson  general regulations j staking is not usually needed on small trees if one believes stakes are needed the stakes are placed well outside the existing root mass and the holding straps are fastened loosely to the trunk to let it partially sway in the wind as it would naturally this will let the roots develop strength needed to support the weight of the tree against wind throw k once planted the tree should receive approximately ten gallons of water to start watering will continue until the tree has fully established one year for every inch caliper based on the standard that a new tree should receive an inch of rain weekly and if it doesnt rain one must irrigate to supply the difference the irrigation recommendation is to provide at least three to five gallons of water per week l many people including many landscape architects landscape contractors and maintenance professionals discount the importance of the process and techniques of transplanting trees the transplanting process is critical to the successful establishment and future health of the tree m unfortunately lots of books have information and diagrams that are incorrect outdated and contrary to recent recommendations using these old procedures will eventually cause direct damage to the tree or jeopardize the health of the tree n the information presented here is based on the most recent research and recorded observations of successful techniques for example recent studies about transplanting trees have indicated that smaller trees transplant more easily and more successfully than larger diameter trees they are lighter and easier to handle they are less likely to be dropped or damaged in transit and they are more likely to have adequate roots to support their crown o successful transplanting depends on three main factors 1 root zone moisture level and watering see below  2 planting depth in a proper hole  and 3 time of year for planting root zone moisture and watering the root mass needs adequate moisture levels to supply the leaves and stems for turgor rigidity the general rule applied here is that the tree should receive an inch of rain weekly and if it doesnt rain one must irrigate to supply the difference at least three to five gallons of water is suggested a common error that will prevent successful establishment is to stop irrigating the tree too early in its development how long should one continue to watch the tree for wilting conditions arnold 1993 indicated that irrigation may be needed for as long as three years after transplanting these time frames are for one and onehalf inch to two inch caliper diameter trees at planting this amount of time is not the usual concern of most landscapers but one should inspect the condition of the root zone regularly and keep up the irrigation if one wants the tree to survive the report also indicated that more time will be needed for establishment if one is planting large three to four inches caliper trees or if one is planting trees in northern latitudes 2010 s7 trees 104q proper planting depth planting depth is probably the most common error made when transplanting trees our experiences and observations indicate that trees are frequently planted too deeply into the ground if one cannot see the trunk flare at purchase excavate the top of the ball to expose it this tree had been planted too deeply at the nursery the root mass is distinctly restricted and the trunk is subject to disease and decay this may occur at the nursery during planting or the soil may build up because of cultivation practices in this case the trunk flare will not be visible at the surface of the root mass be sure to excavate the soil to find the trunk flare before transplanting otherwise the buried trunk may develop suckers this concern holds true for containerized trees as well if a tree has been planted too deeply one may be able to see space around the trunk where it has wiggled in the breeze remove the upper portion of the potting mix until the trunk flare is exposed a visible trunk flare is the proper level for the transplant depth time of year for planting b&b trees can be transplanted in the fall winter or spring because root growth occurs mainly in two seasons fall and early spring the trees should be dormant because they have suffered severe up to 85% root loss while being dug and wrapped in burlap they will use energy stored in the trunk and roots to support new root growth if planting after winter dont wait too long because trees need adequate time to develop enough roots to supply moisture to the spring growth of leaves and stems when selecting these trees be cautious if one notices that fresh roots are growing out of the burlap this indicates that the trees have been in storage for a long time although new roots may exist within the ball those roots outside the burlap will be destroyed when removing the burlap to transplant the trees containerized trees are becoming more popular in the nursery industry they are easier to handle and store than b&b trees because they weigh less and are not as prone to damage of the root mass it is assumed that they can be transplanted at any time of year because the root mass is extensive in the container and the roots will suffer very little damage in transplanting although generally true one still must give serious consideration to root zone moisture during dry months because the plants are not dormant and leaves will be actively growing and losing water s7 104r anderson  general regulations containerized production usually uses an artificial mix without soil that can dry out rapidly be sure the root mass has been thoroughly watered before transplanting and keep adequate moisture levels during establishment bareroot trees will be available from late winter to early spring and must be dormant during storage transit and transplanting the roots may be misted in storage to prevent drying or the roots may be bagged in plastic or mesh bags with moist sawdust or wood chips to prevent drying be sure to shake or brush off as much sawdust as possible before transplanting and do not mix the sawdust or wood chips into the hole the sawdust or wood chips can be added to any surface mulch
