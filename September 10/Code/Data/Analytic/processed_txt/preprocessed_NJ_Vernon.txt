where practical based upon his or her judgment a purpose and scope 1 areas within the township are underlain by carbonate bedrock such as limestone and dolomite the solution of this bedrock causes surface depressions open drainage passages and the development of irregular subsurface rock topography known as karst these conditions make such areas unstable and susceptible to subsidence and surface collapse as a result the alteration of drainage patterns in these areas by the placement of impervious coverage grade changes or increased loads from site improvements can lead to land subsidence and sinkholes fractures or solution openings and fissures in limestone formations may lead to public or private water supplies making those sources especially susceptible to groundwater contamination contamination of water sources can occur from solid and liquid wastes contaminated surface water septic system effluent or other hazardous substances moving or solution openings and fissures within the rock 2 carbonate aquifers are an important source of groundwater in the township vernon relies on a clean supply of subsurface water to protect and promote the public health

applying this section none of the items is intended to preclude the application of judgment innovation and experience appendix _____ represents the best technical judgment available at this time as the township gains experience with this section and local geologic conditions both the level of review and the scope of appendix _____ should be evaluated b a number of testing procedures are presented in appendix _____  these include direct methods such as site reconnaissance test pits test probes and test borings direct methods are essentially those procedures which allow the investigator to physically see or sample some of the geotechnical parameters of the site direct methods can provide an accurate picture of known site locations it is then necessary to extrapolate these known data points to the entire site  indirect methods include the use of such items as aerial photography satellite imagery and geophysical procedures with geophysical procedures one records some earth properties and attempts to correlate each property with more specific site characteristics such as rock properties or depths indirect methods must be used with great care because of the complex nature of karst sites indirect methods may not detect small variations in the carbonate bedrock features which may be of great significance to the project design c direct methods testing involves the following  site reconnaissance an onsite reconnaissance by a person with knowledge of local geology is important to develop an understanding of the site constraints prior to  33084 vernon code  33084  conducting onsite reconnaissance field personnel should review aerial photography to look for the presence of such features as photo lineaments vegetation changes and depression areas black and white aerial photographs when viewed in a stereo image can reveal such features as sinkholes closed surface depressions lineaments and bedrock pinnacles older aerial photographs are a valuable resource to document changes in the land forms or karst features which have occurred on the site over time  test pits test pits are a simple inexpensive way to view the overburden materials and the condition and variability of the carbonate rock surface test pits are backhoe excavations generally to the depth of the bedrock or limitation of backhoe  test probes these generally consist of advancing a steel bit into the ground by an airpercussion machine essentially a large mobile jackhammer is used depth of normal penetration is usually less than 50 feet the cuttings are blown out of the hole and examined although quite disturbed these cuttings yield a sample of the materials penetrated the amount of air injected and return of cuttings at the surface can indicate the presence of fractures and cavities the rate of speed of the advance of the probe provides a qualitative estimate of the competency of the material encountered backfilling with a fluid cement grout and recording the volume of materials placed in the drill hole of known dimension can also yield a measure of the size of openings encountered in the subsurface during the downward progress of the probe  test borings test borings can yield virtually complete and undisturbed soil and rock samples these provide visual evidence of fractures weathering fracture fillings and even the vertical dimensions of cavities a measure of the drilling fluid losses can also indicate the volume and nature of any soil or rock cavities encountered backfilling with a fluid cement grout and recording the volume of materials placed in the drill hole of known dimension can also yield a measure of the size of openings encountered in the subsurface during the downward progress of the probe d indirect methods testing involves the following  aerial photography this is the simplest indirect technique particularly when photos taken over a long time period are analyzed open depressions bedrock exposures vegetation and moisture changes over time can be  33084 general provisions  33084  detected on either black and white or color photographs piles of rock or small groups of brush or trees in otherwise open fields can indicate active sinkholes or rock pinnacles breaking the ground surface images defined at wave lengths over than visible light can be as useful as or even more useful than conventional aerial photographs these images are generally available from satellite mapping work  geophysical procedures a various geophysical investigation techniques which can be used in karst terrains include groundpenetrating radar electrical conductivity electrical resistivity magnetic field very low frequency measurement elf gravity field recording and seismic velocity measurements in general none of these methods has the ability to discriminate all fractures and small cavities the data provides information on the variation in underground conditions which should be interpreted by a person trained in geophysics b these procedures are used to identify zones of variation across a site areas showing variation are then targeted for additional direct testing procedures geophysical procedures should not be used as the only method of verifying underground conditions information gathered with geophysical procedures is useful when extrapolating directly measured data c the variability in physical properties and the solutioned nature of most carbonate rock sites require an increase in the number of sites analyzed and the use of several investigation methods to provide a reliable interpretation of the subsurface conditions f procedures and submission requirements for development in the carbonate area overlay districts 1 all applicants for development approval shall undertake a geotechnical

33086 general provisions  33087  a rationale vernons expansive valley and substantial mountains make its scenic vistas unique among new jerseys municipalities however the unique views provided both from the valley floor toward plateaus and ridges and from plateaus and ridges toward the valley floor are threatened by continuing development patterns which establish building sites that destroy the visual resources of open fields mountain profiles watercourses and woodlands left unchecked such development would afford views mainly of buildings in repeated monotonous patterns akin to those found in suburban sprawl sprawl development in vernon threatens to transform the character and quality of this community more acutely than in other communities because of the expansive views and many vantage points found throughout the township particularly along the scenic corridors the effects of sprawl are insidious enough in suburban communities where vantage points are limited  in vernon sprawl threatens to destroy the dramatic visual attributes that have proved so inviting to the townships citizens and visitors and so essential to community character sprawl and the appearance of sprawl threaten to defeat vernons substantial economic interest in outdoor recreation and tourism unless vernon can remain a place of distinctive natural beauty it is at risk of losing its identity as a place of destination b purpose this section is designed to protect vernons remaining open spaces from conventional development patterns and measures which tend to compromise the intrinsic value of

community classification 1 goals and objectives a findings and purpose the master plan establishes as one of its goals and objectives the preservation of existing residential neighborhoods and lake communities and the review of residential zoning standards governing the lake communities in order to avoid unnecessary variances id at i1 the master plan recognizes the lake resort communities from the 1930s and later lake communities as having unique and common qualities which are distinguishable from other residential neighborhoods and communities within the township approximately 40% of the townships residents live within the lake communities source 1995 master plan at ii1  the largest of these is highland lakes with 1959 homes and a population of over 4500 at page ii9 the master plan observes the following the medium density residential land use refers to the r3 zone which includes the existing lake communities the density as per the current zoning is for a 30000 square foot lot although the lake communities were planned out on a 10000 square foot or smaller lot basis this discrepancy in the zoning should be resolved since this zoning requires a variance procedure for any expansion activity of the existing homes within the lake community were established prior to 1978 in 84editors note this section was repealed 162003 by but was later reinstated in its entirety on 8252003 by  general provisions  330184  the lake communities are grandfathered under current zoning ordinances it is recommended therefore that a lake community zoning district be established which would recognize the grandfathered lots and establish appropriate zoning standards that would preclude the need for board of adjustment relief for minor dwelling additions without increasing the density in the community highland lakes country club and community association prepared a master plan concerning the future management and development of its community the establishment of this new zoning district would complement the objectives of the highland lakes master plan the highland lakes master plan indicates that it is very important that homes be permitted to improve and the zoning should be so structured to permit these improvements this will also achieve the same objective for the other lake communities  it is therefore the purpose of this section and the corresponding standards reflected in schedules a and b85 to reconcile these purposes and prevailing conditions with appropriate zoning standards to the benefit of the lake communities  it is also the purpose of this section to encourage the private lake communities to prepare and adopt express community policies andor standards with respect to land development and redevelopment within a private community and

c mtc mountain conservation classification and district  source  intent and purpose 1 certain lands comprising part of hamburg mountain are subject to a deed restriction benefitting the public which restriction limits the use of such lands to  parks natural areas forests camping fishing water reserves wildlife reservoirs hunting boating winter sports and similar uses for either public outdoor recreation or conservation of natural or historic resources or both such language effectively incorporates the language of njsa a37f which defines recreation and conservation purposes and which includes natural areas this definition is part of the new jersey green acres land acquisition and recreation opportunities act that act principally contemplates the governmental acquisition of lands for outdoor recreation and conservation purposes acquisition for public purposes can be accomplished under the act by  a restriction on the use of land  330184 general provisions  330184  by others including owners of other interests therein  such interest or right sometimes known as a conservation easement sic 2 as grantor of the lands subject to this restriction new jersey department of environment protection dep appears to have subsequently vested considerable discretion in the township as to the interpretation and enforcement of the restriction this places the township in a position of broad responsibility since the public to be benefitted would presumably extend beyond the citizenry of vernon township 3 since it would appear that deps reservation of rights on behalf of the public is clearly in the nature of a conservation restriction the township takes notice of the legislatures definition of that term as an interest in land  appropriate to retaining land or water areas predominantly in their natural scenic or open or wooded condition or for conservation of soil or wildlife or for outdoor recreation or park use or as suitable habitat for fish or wildlife to forbid or limit any or all 1 construction or placing of buildings roads signs billboards or other advertising or other structures on or above the ground 2 dumping or placing of soil or other substance or material as landfill or dumping or place of trash waste or unsightly or offensive materials 3 removal or destruction of trees shrubs or other vegetation 4 excavation dredging or removal of loam peat gravel soil rock or other mineral substance 5 surface use except for purposes permitting the land or water area to remain predominantly in its natural condition 6 activities detrimental to drainage flood control water conservation erosion control or soil conservation or fish and wildlife habitat preservation 7 other acts or uses detrimental to the retention of land or water areas according to the purposes of this chapter njsa b2b 4 having employed the legal device of conservation restriction in order to give effect to the language of the restriction which incorporates the defined scope of recreation and conservation purposes under njsa a37f it would seem that the state has contemplated use of these lands which is substantially more limited than the uses permitted under the cr commercial recreation classification making the permissible use of these lands  330184 vernon code  330184  significantly inconsistent with that zoning classification the mountain conservation classification is thus designed to reconcile the different controls which regulate the use of these lands the classification and district are further designed to be consistent with the restricted use of the hamburg mountain wildlife management area in vernon and hardyston townships and to promote the types of recreational activities such as hiking fishing and crosscountry skiing as are contemplated in the land use plan of the master plan as ecotourism for the conservation district finally this classification would limit disturbance of woodlands steep slopes wildlife habitats and other environmentally sensitive areas as well as preserve the profile of the mountains ridgeline all as contemplated in the conservation plan of the master plan accordingly use of these lands shall be restricted as follows a permitted principal uses outdoor recreation and conservation including parks natural areas historic areas forests camping fishing water reserves preservation and appreciation
