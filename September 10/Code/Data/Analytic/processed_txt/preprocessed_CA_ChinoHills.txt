local climactic geologic and topographical conditions within the citys jurisdiction this finding is supported and based upon the following express findings which address each of these conditions and present the local situation which make the proposed amendments necessary 1 the climate weather patterns within the city include frequent periods of drought and low humidity adding to the fire danger fire season can be yearround in this region 2 during the summer months the dry winds and existing vegetation mix to create a hazardous fuel condition which has resulted in large loss vegetation and structure fires summer temperatures exceeding one hundred degrees 100 and severe santa ana winds frequently occur and can move a fire quickly throughout areas of the city multiple shifting wind patterns throughout the canyon areas add to the difficulty in suppressing fires 3 because of weather patterns the city has experienced a need for water conservation due to the storage capacities and consumption and a limited amount of rainfall drought conditions future water allocation is not fully dependable while sound management of the water resources is possible demands and possible critical depletions on an already stressed water supply can most assuredly be predicted 4 features located throughout the city are major roadways highways freeways and flood control channels which create barriers and slow response times other unique factors which create barriers and slow response times are the multiple canyons located within the city and the large california institute for men property 5 the topography is also very steep in large areas of the city affecting the rate of fire spread and response times 6 due to the sloping in the regional valley where the city is located as well as the present street and storm drain design heavy rainfall causes roadway flooding and landslides which at times may make an access route impassable 7 the city has within its boundaries active seismic hazards seismic activity within the city occurs yearly and a fire potential exists with these active faults existing structures and planned new development are at serious risk from an earthquake this risk includes fire collapse and the disruption of water supply for firefighting purposes areas can also become isolated as a result of bridge overpass and road damage and debris 8 structures in close proximity to each other pose an exposure problem which may cause a fire to spread from one structure to another as well as to the wildland area 9 for practical and cost reasons many new structures are built of wood construction many existing structures also have wood shake roofs the potential for a conflagration exists due to the design and density of current structures 10 electrical supply and telephone communication failures occur due to high winds as well as others reasons water supply pumps and early notification cannot always be counted on 11 narrow and winding streets with little circulation and streets designed as storm drains impede emergency vehicle access and evacuation routes each of the numbered findings above is located below the section to which it relates  2007

pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  part 2006   appeals board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable 6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the san bernardino county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency  part 2006   conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles iv and v of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in of this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in of this chapter to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in see public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance g upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  part 2006 expedited permit process for small residential rooftop solar systems   purpose this

design quality is achieved while at the same time providing the flexibility necessary to encourage creativity and innovation the planning commission shall be responsible for the design review of singlefamily detached residential development projects d while the overall intent of the guidelines shall be followed and every attempt shall be made to comply with the guidelines compliance with any one specific guideline or every single guideline is not mandated for each project unless the term shall is used specifically in such guideline compliance with any one specific guideline may be modified or waived by the planning commission if the commission determines that there are counterbalancing factors associated with the development which ensure that it will be consistent with the overall intent of these guidelines any time a specific guideline is modified or waived by the planning commission the following must be identified 1 the specified guideline modified or waived 2 the rationale for such modification 3 the counterbalancing factor and 4 how the intent of the guidelines will continue to be achieved notwithstanding such modification or waiver 2 applicability a the

this development in making such a determination the hearing body shall find i that the proposed singlefamily detached residential development is consistent with the general plan  ii that the proposed design and layout of the singlefamily detached residential development a is sufficiently varied to avoid monotony in the external appearance  and b is in harmony with the appearance of other existing

site planning guidelines 1 an important goal of the singlefamily site planning guidelines is to create a functional and varied streetscape it is the intent of these site planning guidelines to discourage singlefamily detached residential developments where identical homes march down long uninterrupted straight streets with no variation in building placement or the street scene 2 all singlefamily detached residential developments will be evaluated by the planning commission for their conformity with the design guidelines contained in this section with particular emphasis placed on meeting the following general and specific site planning criteria a general site planning criteria i variation of size dimensions and placement of a singlefamily detached residential development the design of singlefamily detached residential developments shall be such that there is variation in the size dimensions and placement of the lots to avoid a repetitious street scene of nearly identical twostory houses built at the minimum setback lines the size and width of the individual lots within a development shall differ from one another this requirement is intended to create variety and avoid monotony within a development ii preservation of protected trees as defined in g and as regulated by other significant site features the significant existing natural features of the project site shall be retained these features shall be an integral part of the overall design and layout of the singlefamily detached residential development iii variation of placement of dwelling units on the individual placement of the houses on individual lots within a singlefamily detached residential development shall be varied to create visual character and avoid repetition the variation in the placement of each house on the individual lot shall be such that no dwelling unit on two or more adjacent lots are the same iv provision of neighborhood amenities entrance treatment for the singlefamily detached residential development enhanced landscaping to create a mature appearance decorativeaccent paving passive and active open space et cetera the design of singlefamily detached residential developments shall include neighborhood amenities which orient and give focus to the neighborhood thereby creating a sense of community and providing the residents with opportunities to walk jog and bike there is a need to create strong pedestrian and open space connections within and between neighborhoods usable outdoor areas such as playgrounds tot lots small parks footpaths et cetera shall be included as part of the overall design and layout of a new singlefamily detached residential development so as to provide areas for the residents to meet one another and to recreate v enhanced treatment of drainage courses and drainage structures the color treatment of down drains and other drainage structures is encouraged natural drainage courses shall be preserved and integrated into the overall layout and design of a singlefamily detached residential development vi enhanced treatment of walls the walls constructed within a singlefamily detached residential development shall reflect quality and shall complement the architectural style of the development within which they are located the materials of the walls shall be such that they are permanent decorative walls ie masonry shall be provided at the edges of the singlefamily detached residential development and along the streets such walls are to include architectural embellishments whenever the walls are visible from any street andor common areas within a development all walls and fences shall be constructed of durable materials such as masonry masonry combination stone brick concrete wrought iron tubular steel or other type of material as may be approved by the planning commission or the community development director for durability aesthetics and sound attenuation purposes no wood fencing shall be permitted  this prohibition against wood fencing is not applicable to fencing used as part of multipurpose trails no chainlink fencing is permitted in front or street facing side or rear yards except that chainlink fencing that was installed prior to  shall be considered legal nonconforming structures no barbed wire razor ribbon or other similar temporary material shall be permitted as a wall andor fencing material except in undeveloped agriculture ranch or open space areas as required to restrict cattle movement or on utilities or other public facilities required to provide security the setbacks of the walls in a singlefamily detached residential development shall be varied especially when they are located adjacent to major streets arterialscollector streets in order to increase visual interest vii other amenities unique to the project in addition to entrance treatments enhanced landscaping and passive and active open space other amenities shall be included as part of the design of a new singlefamily detached residential development in order to provide opportunities for the residents to enjoy meet and recreate within their community the provision of street furniture such as benches trash containers fountains planting pots ornamental streetlights and other appropriate amenities is encouraged such amenities shall be provided in all singlefamily detached residential development within parkways and common areas in order to create visual interest and address pedestrian needs b specific site planning criteria i variable front yard setbacks varied and staggered setbacks of the houses on the individual lots are encouraged in order to avoid the monotony of repetitive setbacks the variation in the placement of each house on the individual lot shall be such that the front yard setback on two adjacent lots are not the same front yard setbacks must vary by at least two feet to satisfy these criteria ii curvilinear streets curvilinear streets are encouraged on straight roads knuckles or culsdesac are to be used in order to limit the length of straight stretches occasional curves change the street scene curves that seem very slight are readily perceived by the driver and interrupt the line of sight thus creating a variable street scene iii variable lot widths singlefamily detached residential developments shall include lots of variable widths with some of the lots being wider than the others the use of different lot widths throughout a development will assist in creating a varying streetscape making it more interesting by breaking up the monotony that occurs with uniform lot widths in no case shall two adjacent lots have the same lot width  lot widths must vary with a five foot minimum suggested by using differing lot widths variation in the building mass is provided because there is more diversity in the placement of each house on the individual lot and there is greater variation in the size and shape of the footprint of the house a continuous row of the same lot width is discouraged because it will inevitably result in a dull and repetitive streetscape iv variable garage placement and orientation the placement of garages on the individual lots shall be varied further the garages shall be designed to reduce their visual impact on the street the visual dominance of garages on streets shall be minimized by locating garages at the front rear or side of the house with a front or side entry the garages shall be of differing sizes garage elements can be completely separate detached or connected to the house by a breezeway a front entry garages for front loaded garages where the entrance to the garage is parallel to the street the distance between the garage door in the closed position and the street shall be a minimum of nineteen 19 feet this nineteen 19 foot minimum dimension is to allow for the parking of vehicles on the driveway without encroaching into the street b garages located at the front of the house shall have a strong singlestory element at the front of the structure unless the planning commission determines pursuant to the process described in a of this development that there are counterbalancing factors associated with the development which ensure that the intent of the guidelines will be met notwithstanding such modification or waiver c the purpose of this singlestory element requirement is to minimize the appearance of bulk and overcrowding when viewed from the street the single story element of the garage is to provide relief and an architectural transition into the twostory massing of the remainder of the structure the transition from the singlestory to the secondstory shall not occur any closer than fifteen 15 feet from the front of the garage d side entry garages for side loaded garages with access provided from a curved driveway where the garage entrance is perpendicular to the street the front yard setback shall be a minimum of sixteen 16 feet e split tandem for three car garages detached and perpendicular garages are encouraged to break up the monotony which would otherwise occur if all of the garage doors of each house were to be located parallel to the street f all garages shall have roll up garage doors c architectural guidelines 1 building massingscale and style a massingscale mass is the three dimensional bulk of a structure its height width and depth scale is the size and magnitude of a structure as distinguished from its shape which is the form of a building created by its outline the mass and scale of a building should relate to its use as a singlefamily residence each residence should be designed at a human scale so as not to overwhelm or dominate its surroundings b second story massing guidelines i the second story of a house shall wherever feasible exhibit a lighter mass and scale than the base by reducing floor area andor building mass ii second story wall planes oriented towards a street including front side and rear elevations shall be varied and articulated to reduce the overall massing and scale and to avoid an uninterrupted flat wall from the ground floor to the second story c style there is no particular architectural style required for single family residences rather the focus is to be on developing a high quality residential environment a neighborhood the appearance of the houses including their architectural style should be compatible with the character of the neighborhood including harmonious and unified style form size color material and roofline however each of the individual houses should be distinguishable from one another the mixing of various elements from distinctly different architectural styles should be avoided the creation of houses with a classic andor vintage style using scale proportion and materials is encouraged so as to create a strong sense of place 2 enhanced architectural treatment a the ornamentation of the facades and variation in the massing of the structures give them richness and scale all residential units shall include enhanced architectural treatment on all elevations ie three hundred sixty 360 degree architecture that are visible from any street andor common area within a development unless otherwise approved by the planning commission design review process long flat uninterrupted exterior walls or roof planes shall be avoided on all structures all walls of the houses shall have relief to create visual interest and to cast shadows enhanced architectural treatment includes porches tower elements balconies ornamented chimneys and other highly articulated architectural features b variation in the roof planes and use of ornamental elements on the roof is encouraged such variation may be achieved by changes in plane andor the use of traditional roof forms such as gables hips sheds and dormers when appropriate to the architectural style moderate roof overhangs of at least eighteen 18 inches shall be provided in order to create strong shadow lines both vertical and horizontal articulation of each individual roof is encouraged  long unbroken rooflines are to be avoided rooflines are to be representative of the design and scale of the units under them the pitch and scale of the roof is to be in proportion to the size of the house the bulk of a building may be reduced by breaking the roof form into smaller parts flat roofs are generally discouraged unless they are appropriate to the architectural style roof mounted equipment is prohibited 3 varied structure design the design of the houses within each singlefamily detached residential development shall be varied to create visual interest and diversity in the street scene excessive repetition of singlefamily houses with near identical elevations shall be avoided a significant difference in the massing and composition not just the finish materials of each adjacent house is to be accomplished one exterior design shall not be repeated more frequently than each fourth house the elevations of the houses within a singlefamily detached residential development are to be varied as follows nu mb er of ho use s min imu m nu mb er of diff ere nt ele vati ons  5 10 3

may be counted as additional elevations 4 materials the choice and mix of materials on the facades of the houses and the garage doors is important in providing an attractive living environment any materials applied to the exterior elevation shall be integrated into the overall architecture of the building so that the materials do not appear to be artificial or otherwise tacked onto the structure piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in the type of materials applied to the building exterior shall be avoided whenever a building can be viewed from any street andor common areas within a development the visible elevations shall be architecturally treated unless otherwise approved by the planning commission design review process 5 vents and downspouts roof flashing rain gutters and downspouts vents and other roof protrusions shall be finished to match the adjacent materials andor colors the use of copper bronze verdigris or aged finishes is encouraged 6 equipment screening roofmounted equipment is prohibited any equipment placed on the ground shall be shielded and architecturally screened from view from onsite parking areas on site common areas within the development any street from a point immediately adjacent to the site and adjacent residentially zoned properties at the same elevation the method of equipment screening shall be architecturally compatible with the design of the house in terms of materials color shape and size satellite dishes air conditioners and pool equipment shall not be located in the front yard  rather they shall only be located in the rear and side yards so as to be screened from view of the adjoining properties and the street 7 walls a walls are to be constructed of durable materials such as masonry masonry

house a variety of compatible designs are to be used throughout a singlefamily detached residential development so as to insure visual interest and avoid monotony the design of the garage door is to relate to the particular architectural style of the house  2005   1998  1242012  c 182013   982015   11242015   12112018   multifamily housingadditional standards a open space requirements all

uses is intended to preserve the citys equestrian heritage while establishing standards to ensure that the number of animals on a property and associated uses and operations do not create a negative impact on the environment and the surrounding community the equestrian and large animal overlay district includes five different overlay categories throughout the city namely level 1 level 2 level 3 bayberry and boys republic each category is defined by specific locations within the city shown in figure 1 equestrian and large animal overlay district map below each overlay category has standards appropriate to the physical parameters of its location for maximum number of animals allowed permitted uses and best management practices in order to comply with water quality requirements b the following overlay districts are established in the equestrian and large animal overlay district 1 the level 1 overlay allows equestrian and large animal operations as an accessory use to a primary residential dwelling unit within the english road area of the citys agriculture ranch general plan land use designation areas the city of chino hills general plan classifies the agriculture ranch land use designation as large lot residential development suitable for equestrian estates the agriculture ranch land use designation also allows for public and private stables and related uses as an accessory use to a primary residential dwelling unit given the historical equestrian commercial operations in the english road community and its agriculture ranch land use designation the area is included in the level 1 overlay classification 2 the level 2 overlay provides for animal keeping and light equestrian and large animal operations as an accessory use to a primary residential dwelling unit in order to ensure compatibility of land uses and preserve the quality of life for all residents the level 2 overlay classification is proposed for low density residential and rural residential designated lots with a minimum lot size of 20000 square feet of flat usable topography and compatible for the keeping of large animals this area is located between eucalyptus avenue and soquel canyon parkway 3 the level 3 overlay provides for grazing on public and private open space land and vacant undeveloped lots grazing on open space and undeveloped lands is part of the citys rural heritage the level 3 overlay classification is proposed for large open space and undeveloped areas of five 5 acres or more throughout the city that can support the grazing of large animals without the need to import feed this allows for fuel modification in open space areas without the degradation of the land 4 the bayberry overlay has unique characteristics which deviate from the level 2 overlay requiring specific and separate regulations the bayberry overlay has existing large animal keeping uses on smaller lot sizes these conditions require specific issues related to drainages and water quality and existing unique animal uses 5 the boys republic overlay is unique in that it is specific to the boys republic which is an institutional and educational use that has historically included animal keeping operations primarily of cows as of the adoption of this the boys republic site has four lots totaling one hundred ninetythree 193 acres a 482014   8262014   definitions of title 16 the

this chapter the stated standards shall be mandatory where the words should could or similar language is used the provisions shall be considered guidelines only unless required by the community development director planning commission or city council discretionary approval process  1995   grading guidelines applicable to all projects the grading standards listed in this section and illustrated in figures 931 shall be required of all development projects as approved by the director of community development a the overall shape height and grade of any cut or fill slope shall be

for each project including the issuance of grading permits a the toe and crest of any slope in excess of ten 10 feet vertical height should be rounded with vertical curves of radii no less than five feet and designed in proportion to the total height of the slope b where cut or fill slopes over five feet in vertical height exceed one hundred 100 feet in horizontal length the contours of the slope should be curved in a continuous undulating fashion with varying radii to reflect the natural terrain c a manufactured slope bank should not exceed thirty 30 feet in vertical height unless no feasible alternative exists or unless grading can be significantly reduced by increasing slope height however the use of an alternative design is strongly recommended as the desirable approach in reducing grading and slope height any bank exceeding twentyfive 25 feet in height regardless of length should have variable gradients unless the city requires a maximum  slope gradient due to onsite soil conditions d the provisions of subsection a and b above generally do not apply to side yard slopes that is slopes between residential lots except where the side yard slope is highly visible  1995

village structure and identity introduction the character of chino hills at large is a function of its topographic features interconnecting natural open spaces and the landscaping treatment in medians of primary and major highways these elements also become the determinants for area boundaries shown in figure appendix b1 often prominent ridge lines perform this function such as between the carbon canyon and soquel canyon areas in some cases major highways such as peyton drive form boundaries as between los ranchos the oaks and woodview and occasionally property ownership lines influence the exact boundary alignment as in the case of carbon canyon and los ranchos areas beyond the identity provided by topography the character of an area is established statements existing tree stands drainage ways and landscaping within the commercial areas and within parkways along primary and major highways and streets and pathways leading to the commercial centers this appendix identifies the character of the landscaping and related design treatments which should be used in the eight areas shown in figure appendix b1 the intent of these guidelines is to provide direction in establishing or reinforcing the identity of various areas of the city landowners and developers are encouraged to design alternative landscape treatments which equally or better achieve the desired intent mandatory standards for all areas the following standards apply citywide including in the eight areas mapped in figure appendix b1 1 disturbed areas between natural open space and developed lands shall be established with native materials in a natural setting consistent with fire safety and erosion standards 2 enhancement of natural drainage coursesriparian habitat so that they are incorporated into active open space areas of the village and improved with facilities such as additional landscaping and pedestrian and bicycle pathways 3 replacement of existing native type vegetation where original vegetation was eliminated by major public facilities such as roads 4 parking areas should be screened from view use of berms fencing and landscaping 5 preservation of protected trees as defined in g rolling ridge estates this area is located in the extreme northern portion of the city along the west side of the chino valley freeway highway 71 just south of the pomona freeway state route 60 it is characterized by rolling hills and valleys that become very steep and rugged in the western half where there are also some very significant strands of native oak trees because of its proximity to two major highways this area has a high degree of visibility this suggests some very intensive commercial and residential land sues along the highway 71 corridor and also special care in preserving some natural features such as knolls and ridge lines to retain some degree of rural character and continuity with other villages this area has two land use focal points one is the regional shopping center planned on about 90 acres along highway 71 it is surrounded by supporting commercial and high density 15 to 24 dwelling units per acre residential uses a commercial center is also provided more in the center of the area it is intended to be the focus of activities for residents of the area and will contain convenience commercial and public uses landscape treatment for this area should include formal tree plantings and color in development areas within the urban area transportation corridors should feature a formal arrangement of median tree plantings parkways and areas between developments should be formal in nature including screening to separate different uses and various housing projects the following guidelines have been prepared to provide direction in establishing a design identity for this area 1 tree stands in parkways and medians should be under planted with turf or carissa grandiflora or gazania hybrids 2 screening to separate land uses should consist of large shrubs such as escallonia fradesi abelia grandiflora grevillea lanigera pittosporum tobira and xylosma congestum 3 differing intensities of development should be provided with identity use of color treatment peculiar to each area of intensity suggested tree species include albizia julibrissin silk tree bauhinia variegate purple orchid tree chorisia speciosa floss silk tree jacaranda acutifolia lagerstromeia indica crape myrtle pyrus kawakamii evergreen pear and tipuana tipu 4 fencing is suggested to consist of brick pilasters five 5 feet in height ten 10 feet on center with wrought iron or wood panels 5 the regional shopping center should be landscaped in a manner compatible with and supportive of the overall landscaping guidelines for adjacent areas of rolling ridge landscaping shall serve in lieu of fencing or barrier walls and should not conflict with appropriate view corridors to the regional center tres hermanos this area is located in the northwestern portion of the city it encompasses the upper tonner canyon area a long welldefined canyon with a broad grassland valley bottom the valley contains a narrow drainage course featuring several small manmade reservoirs the landscape treatment will capitalize on the view potential by creating view windows along major roads because the valley is relatively shallow fencing should feature some bermed walls in earthen tones banked with low grass forms lighting will be fairly strong along the major highways the following guidelines have been prepared to aid in establishing a design identity for this area 1 the village core and adjacent high density development should be linked by safe convenient and attractive pedestrian paths landscaping should feature materials used in the commercial center and provide winter sun and summer shade they should also be tastefully lighted to encourage evening use suggested tree types are platanus racemosa and populus fremontii 2 grand avenue and tonner canyon road should have center medians landscaped to provide area identity and community wide continuity suggested tree types are platanus racemosa for grand avenue and tristania conferta for tonner canyon road 3 fencing is suggested to consist of a mixture of undulating berms and walls of slump stone or other appropriate materials berms should be planted in low grasses or ground covers baccharis pilularis or gazania hybrids are suggested 4 buffers adjacent to developments are suggested to consist of massing of broad tree types include schinus molle and acacia baileyana underplanting of acacia longifolia dodonea viscosa and rhus species are suggested for screening los ranchos this area is located in the midnorthern portion of the city it is composed of rolling hills and valleys generally devoid of any visually significant vegetation english creek and a tributary stream of little chino creek add a riparian feature to two of the largest valleys much of the character of the area is derived from the large horse ranches located along english road in the east central part of the area the countrywestern orientation inspired by these ranches will become the theme of the entire area it appears in the architecture of ralphs commercial center in the gordon ranch planned development and is intended to be used in theme structures fencing equestrian paths and landscaping the following guidelines are provided to assist in establishing a design identity for this area 1 parkway landscaping should consist of a nonuniform arrangement of planting masses including trees shrubs and ground covers wherever possible the streetscape edges should be left in their natural state recommended parkway trees are cinnamon camphora eucalyptus polyanthemos gingko biloba gleditsia tricanthos inermis liquidambar styraciflua liriodendron tulipifera pinus eldarica and platanus acerifolia suggested shrubs are baccharis pilularis hypericum calycinum lonicera japonica and rosmarinus officinalis 2 natural drainage courses should be preserved and integrated into the local open space system landscaping should include seasonally wateroriented plants to stabilize and enhance the natural riparian streambeds suggested trees are platanus racemosa and populus fremontii 3 fencing should be of a design material and color that complements the area character the primary materials should be stone and wood an example is an open split rail fence five 5 feet in height 4  4 inch posts eight 8 feet on center strapped top and bottom by 2  8 inch top and bottom rails with diagonal straps of i  6 inch boards the use of stone pilasters is also suggested woodview this area is located in the mideastern portion of chino hills generally along the west side of state highway 71 because of its accessibility and relatively level topography most of the area has already developed included in this area are the communities of los serranos and glenmeade and the open spaces within boys republic the los serranos golf course and the lake los serranos club mobilehome community woodview has a very definite suburban character stemming from the singlefamily detached housing which predominates some visual relief is provided by the large open space uses noted above and of equal importance several much smaller landscape features they include the median strip in glenmeade boulevard the parkways along the south side of carbon canyon road and west side of pipeline avenue several natural drainage courses and the strong eucalyptus windrows mostly in the southern end of the area these features should be preserved enhanced and reinforced the primary landscape treatment in woodview is the continued use of the eucalyptus windrow the trees should be planted along the drainage ways major streets entries and village core areas to strengthen the area identity the following guidelines have been prepared to provide assistance in landscaping design in this area 1 eucalyptus windrows should be continued or introduced along drainage ways medians and parkways eucalyptus camaldulinsis and eucalyptus cladocalyx are suggested at staggered intervals of twenty feet 20 on center ten feet 10 on center for street medians eucalyptus sideroxylon is also recommended for color accent 2 fencing should be provided in short runs not to exceed forty feet 40 and five feet six inches 56 to six feet 6 in height suggested materials are 6  6 inch posts 8 feet 8 on center with 4  6 inch and 1  10 inch vertical shiplap fencing should face at 45 degree angles at intersections and have open slats at drainage corridors 3 crosswalks at area entries and in the commercial areas should be textured with contrasting materials carbon canyon the carbon canyon area is located in the midsouthwestern portion of the city it is distinguished by an abundance of natural features including winding treecovered streams prominent ridge lines steep hillside slopes and large stands of native oaks the setting is highly valued by local residents and travelers on carbon canyon road carbon canyon road a state highway is the only paved road hills directly into orange county and has enabled much of the adjacent lands up and down the canyon to develop the first areas to develop were sleepy hollow and the canon lane subdivision tracts of small lots recorded in the 1920s located at the west end of the area next to orange county they have over the years evolved into small rural neighborhoods both are characterized by tiny lots narrow streets and attractive homes most notably however they complement the natural setting and contribute substantially to the rural charm of the area the landscape treatment of the area and the architectural treatment of structures in the core should feature natural materials such as river rock and unpainted roughhewn boards to enhance the rustic qualities of the area the following guidelines have been prepared to provide direction in landscaping in the carbon canyon area 1 landscaping should utilize native plant materials as much as possible recommended species include platanus racemosa western sycamore quercus species coast live oak and scrub oak schinus molle california pepper tree heteromeles arbutifolia toyon and rhus species 2 introduced plant materials considered consistent with the rural character of the area include acacia baileyana atriplex semibaccata saltbush ceanothus griseus horizontalis wild lilac gazania hybrids and prunas lyonii catalina cherry 3 landscaping should be limited to areas that have been disturbed or for screening screening of development from carbon canyon road is especially important 4 fencing should have a rural appearance natural peeler poles with grapestake inserts is suggested where closed fencing is required open fencing of splitlot rail andor barbed wire is suggested the oaks the oaks smallest of the areas is located in the center of the city its character is defined primarily by natural features an exceptionally prominent ridgeline forming the west boundary a small grassland valley abutting the easterly edge and many beautiful stands of oak trees in the numerous steep canyons lands immediately north east and west are generally of a lower elevation as a result much of the area enjoys panoramic view of the surrounding area the following guidelines have been prepared to aid in landscape design they are intended to contribute to and enhance the character of the oaks area 1 plantings along transportation corridors in the area should consist of tight clustering of trees that serve as screening and link the commercial center with adjacent high density residential uses suggested species include acacia baileyana koelreuteria paniculata lagerstroemia indica and ficus ritusa 2 skyline treatment should consist of clusters of tree plantings to soften the impact of development and to blend with and emulate the natural land form rather than intrude or conflict with it 3 fencing should be limited and tempered by landscaping as much as possible where fencing is used it should be wooden and confined to short runs to serve as a buffer rather than to accentuate it is suggested that fencing consist of 6  6 inch posts 8 feet on center 5 feet 6 inches in height with a variety of panels soquel canyon this area is located in the southern central portion of the city the land in this area is extremely rugged and relatively inaccessible at the present time there are numerous steep canyons precipitous ridge lines and undisturbed oak and riparian woodland communities a substantial portion of the area is considered to be of high ecological sensitivity because of its value to wildlife the landscape treatment for this area emphasizes the use of native materials in patterns or groupings that convey a natural appearance the only two areas where supplemental planting will likely be required are along ridge lines and soquel canyon parkway skyline plantings along ridge lines will be important to screen roadways and homes from surrounding viewpoints intense landscaping and some closed fencing along soquel canyon parkway will be essential to screen adjacent development and direct the eye to open areas and tree breaks the following guidelines have been prepared to provide assistance in landscape design in the soquel canyon area 1 skyline plantings are suggested to consist of random groupings of eucalyptus species melaleuca leucadendra and tristania conferta with plantings of shrubs such as acacia longifolia and melaleuca nesophila 2 screening of development along soquel canyon parkway should consist of mass plantings of acacia baileyana melalenca luecadendra and schinus molle california pepper tree 3 some wood fencing may be used along soquel canyon parkway to screen development suggested materials are rough cedar planking or grapestake shrubs noted above shall be planted in front of the fence rincon this area is located in the southeastern portion of the city along state highway 71 the terrain is diverse varying from the relatively flat highway corridor to the very rugged hills in the central and western parts of the area the most significant areas of ecological sensitivity are within the peninsula that extends far to the south it contains prime predatorial bird habitats the landscape treatment in rincon area protects and accentuates views along drainage ways and transportation corridors plantings are random rather than formal intensifying with the progression from rural areas in the west to urban areas in the east landscaping tends to focus views and allow for view penetration at drainage ways heavy screening along soquel canyon parkway will mitigate the visual impacts of development in proximity to the roadway dropping out at those locations where view potential occurs the following guidelines are provided to aid in establishing a design identity for the rincon area 1 fencing should be minimal lighting should be sparse and utilitarian along roadways in the rural areas lighting in the corridor should be more formal and urban in nature 2 parkway tree plantings should be linear groupings of vertical tree types to accentuate the view windows at such places as drainage ways eucalyptus nicholii melaluca leucadendra and tristania conferta are suggested 3 drainage ways should be maintained in their natural state because of the high visibility from soquel canyon and rincon roads 4 screening along soquel canyon and rincon roads should consist of about fifty percent 50% plantings and fifty percent 50% fencing feijoa sellowiana tecomaria capensis and xylosma congestum are recommended plant materials the following fence specifications are suggested brick pilasters five feet 5 in height 16  16 inch ten to twelve feet 1012 on center with wrought iron inserts appendix b  figure 1 areas of chino hills former village areas  1242012 appendix c notes for development c general citywide landscape design standards the following standards are excerpted from the chino hills specific plan which formerly functioned as the policy and regulatory planning document for the majority of the area within chino hills because the following pages are an excerpt the following guidelines should be followed when using the information in this appendix references to villages should be considered to apply to areas of chino hills as shown in appendix b to this development the term village cores refers to the neighborhood commercial centers located within each of the areas shown in appendix b where a standard is provided in the chino hills general plan or elsewhere in this development the standards in those locations shall supersede this appendix where necessary to provide background information the chino hills specific plan may be consulted as a historical document policies and regulations in the chino hills specific plan no longer apply chapter 8landscaping intent a the individuality of and relationship between the villages is strengthened by the landscape plan overall community identity is greatly enhanced by the continuity of landscape materials along major thoroughfares conversely village identity is established at major entry points along drainage corridors within village cores and along collector roads leading to the core b guidelines for landscaping and plant selection to create village identity are provided in the purpose of the following standards is to establish communitywide criteria and specifications for various landscape treatments which are likely to be common to many or all villages the categories of landscape treatment are 1 grassland to maintain the natural character of the chino hills some existing grass land areas will be preserved and some graded areas will be reestablished as grassland reestablished grasslands will normally occur as transition zones between development and existing natural grassland areas 2 skyline skyline planting will be used along ridgelines where development is proposed to soften the impact of and draw the eye away from development as a skyline feature 3 ornamental planting the purpose of this type of planting within the community is to add interest form it will serve to attract attention to village entry signs and add color accent to the street scene 4 slope planting this type of landscape is both aesthetic and functional aesthetically it will provide a pleasant backdrop along roadways and it will provide a transition between development and adjacent roadways or various other uses it also helps to improve the physical appearance of manufactured slopes by softening the hard edges and unifying the slope with the adjacent areas functionally slope planting acts to hold the newly graded soil together thus discouraging erosion 5 roadway landscape roadway treatment includes berming fencing and landscaping within the parkway the land area lying between the paved road and adjacent private development it also includes median plantings where appropriate 6 fuel modification a landscaped and irrigated area between inhabited structures and grasslands will frequently be used to reduce the acute fire danger in chino hills highly flammable native brush will be cleared and replaced with mostly low growing groundcover possessing a potentially high moisture content 7 solar shading tree shading and vegetation will be used to reduce outdoor air temperatures and indoor airconditioning demand and also make outdoor walking and bicycling more pleasant in warm weather landscaping standards a all residential commercial industrial mixed use and public land uses shall include landscaping these standards shall apply to all landscaped areas with the exception of private residential yards in which case they serve as guidelines 1 all landscaping must be done with drought tolerant plants from the attached lists of trees shrubs vines and groundcovers ch a drought tolerant shall include plants which when established require watering no more frequently than once every two to three weeks b other drought tolerant plants recommended by a registered landscape architect may be used if approved by the county planning department c grasses shall be used in reestablished grasslands between existing natural grasslands areas and development grasses are also permitted in other locations
