this ratio may be higher than 20% in instances where the townships escrow fund is used to reduce  1791 hopewell code  1792 ao438 development costs or where land costs are either removed from or are

households that qualify by virtue of their having corresponding low and moderate incomes with the exception of inclusionary developments constructed pursuant to low income tax credit regulations half

by the approving authority 4 building permits and certificates of occupancy for the low and moderate income units shall be phasedin as a development progresses so that the low and moderate income

the following and provided the maximum permitted lot coverage for building and paved surfaces is not exceeded the building heights may be increased to a maximum of 40 feet and not more than four stories in order to achieve additional square footage a on tracts of 50 acres or more dedication of at least five acres but a maximum of either 20 acres or 20% of the tract whichever is greater to either the township or an entity responsible for residential development the dedication shall be at no cost and therefore land costs shall not be a factor in the resulting production of housing on that land as part of the development of the nonresidential project if water and sewer services are not already available to the residential portion being dedicated the water and sewer service being developed for the nonresidential project shall be extended to the residential site in exchange for the dedication of land and the provision of water and sewer service the nonresidential developer may take credit for the land dedicated to housing when calculating the permitted amount of gross floor area and the percentage of lot coverage allowed on the nonresidential portion of the tract however this option may not be used if the dedicated acreage in the opinion of the approving authority is inappropriate for housing by virtue of such conditions as but not limited to soil conditions lot

hopewell code  1792 ao440 above in exchange for which the gross floor area and building height may be increased as set forth in paragraph b6b above 7 in order to prevent the bonus residential densities and the additional floor area in nonresidential districts from inflating land costs that might be passed on to a third party and thereby jeopardizing the number of lower income units that might be built when the intent of the bonuses is to subsidize the development of lower income housing no application providing for increased intensities of development shall be approved unless the

40 or more apartment townhouse or  1799 adopting ordinance  17101 ao461 other types of multifamily dwelling units shall make provision for a dedication of land and improvements for recreation facilities it is the purpose of this section to recognize that the need for recreation activities is a direct result of the impact created by each new residential development requiring an area of land in a manner similar to the need for streets storm water control utility services minimum lot sizes and setbacks and other design and improvement standards required to serve the public health safety and welfare 1 where an original tract is proposed to be subdivided into smaller parcels and each smaller parcel would have a capacity less than the minimum number of units set forth above the recreation requirement shall be an obligation calculated on the capacity of the original tract each smaller parcel shall either provide its proportionate share of the obligation of the original tract even if there are fewer units generated by the smaller parcel than the minimum number set forth above or in the event the smaller parcels proportionate share of the obligation is to be deferred the obligation shall be transferred to the remainder of the original tract the remainder of the original tract would then have an increased recreation requirement if and when the remainder of the original tract is developed any recreation obligation transferred to the remainder of an original tract shall be imposed by a deed restriction on the remainder of the original tract in any event transferring a recreation obligation to the remainder of an original tract shall not be permitted where any remaining area would result in an obligation greater than 50% above its own requirement 2 in the event a development is served by water and sewer and the density of the development is 20 units per acre or more the allocation of land shall be achieved by the use of available zoning options to reasonably assure that the permitted number of dwelling units can be achieved together with setting aside the land for recreation these options include cluster design section 1779 modification of lot areas and other restrictions section 1793 planned development section 1798 lot size averaging as set forth in paragraph a3 below or a mixture of housing types permitted in the applicable zoning standards of sections 1792 and 17159 for the residential zoning district in which the property is located singly or in combination while these options are available if a developer opts not to use them any resulting loss of units would be a choice of the developer 3 where one or more utilities is not available and the density is less than 20 units per acre land dedication for recreation together with the opportunity to develop the number of dwelling units permitted under the zoning for that district may be created by using lot size averaging throughout the development where the smallest lot size would be the lot size permitted under the cluster options but without the requirement for public water and sewer  17101 hopewell code  17101 ao462 provided the onsite well and septic systems can be provided in accordance with the applicable health regulations in that manner any land within the development able to meet the requirements for onsite wells and septic systems may have a higher concentration of dwelling units while the land which cannot meet the requirements for well and septic systems may be able to be used to meet the recreation requirement 4 in any event when using the alternative designs cluster lot size averaging mixed housing types etc the resulting number of lots and dwelling units shall not exceed the permitted density or the number of dwelling units that would have resulted with the use of standard development designs 5 it is anticipated that some recreation areas might result in locations where approved sites for wells and septic systems could not be found

approval for wetland buffer averaging or other boundary adjustments and mitigation programs b recreation improvements the following shall be minimum standards for meeting the recreational requirements of the township the primary goal is to develop the recreation areas onsite but alternative sites alternative sized recreation tracts andor types of facilities andor such other reasonable alternatives to meet the recreational requirements may be offered to the approving authority by the developer and accepted by the township consistent with the objectives of this section 1 developments located on sites identified for recreation facilities on various plans set forth in the adopted master plan shall be designed to implement the master plan the approving authority shall encourage the use of applicable provisions of the section see paragraph a2 above that will assist in generating the recreation areas with minimal or no reduction in the amount of development permitted under the zoning where the developer does not wish to create the recreation area as common property the developer may use a lot size averaging design and offer the properly sized property to the township for public purposes 2 the location and type of recreation improvements shall be a determination of the approving authority based on recommendations by the developer and the approving authoritys consideration of
