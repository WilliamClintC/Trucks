is appropriate in most parts of the city there are also areas within the city in which the master plan places greater emphasis on regulating urban form and character of development as well as use and intensity of use b these regulations are based on two 2 significant factors site context and building form site context is derived from existing and desired characteristics of the area where these regulations are applied areas are distinguished from one another by their size and configuration of the site street patterns location and intensity of use therefore considering site context provides a customized approach to the inherent conditions of the areas where these regulations are applied building form addresses the manner in which buildings and structures relate to their lots surrounding buildings and street frontage building form standards control height placement building configuration parking location and ground story activation applicable to the site context c the general purpose of these regulations is as follows 1 ensure that development is of human scale primarily pedestrianoriented and designed to create attractive streetscapes and pedestrian spaces 2 promote infill development and redevelopment to expand the employment and economic base 3 promote mixeduse development in both a horizontal and vertical form 4 ensure reasonable transition between higher intensity development and adjacent neighborhoods 5 improve mobility options and reduce the need for onsite parking by encouraging alternative means of transportation d regulations are tailored to meet a more

plan these regulations are intended to promote a unified vision for transforming big beaver road into a worldclass destination focused on mixeduse development and increased land use intensity that is oriented as much to the needs of the pedestrian as to those of the automobile these regulations are also intended to 1 establish a development pattern in which new buildings and building modifications enhance the character of the existing built environment 2 orient building entrances and storefronts to the street to add visual interest increase pedestrian traffic and to reduce crime surveillance 3 enhance a sense of place and contribute to the sustainability of the city 4 allow a pattern of development which will encourage transportation alternatives walking biking and transit to reduce

types as described in b3 are determined by lot size location and relationship to neighboring sites street types as set forth in b4 recognize that street patterns within the city of troy are established streets range from primary corridors which carry a large volume of traffic to local streets which carry lower volumes of neighborhood traffic 3 site types the regulating plan includes three 3 different site types described as follows a site type bba large scale regional sites  these properties are predominantly between ten 10 and twenty 20 acres in area but they are more strongly related to one another nature and large campusstyle properties with multiple large buildings designed to function as one unit walkability within and between sites and provision of supporting buildings and uses are important to the success of the very large type bba developments they should be designed with a mix of uses in mind to allow for users to obtain basic services on or immediately near the site especially within large office centers where hundreds of workers may populate the site during the day restaurants postal facilities and other daily needs should be integrated within existing buildings or permitted to exist in smaller outlot developments or nearby developments in type b or c categories parking for type bba sites should be accommodated in structured parking whenever possible to maximize the use of the site for the primary use and to allow the site to be developed more densely than it could with surface parking site design should strongly focus on putting the densest components of the project within close range of the primary rightofway to combat the vast open areas that frequently make such sites difficult or undesirable to cross on foot a busy arrangement of campus uses along the right of way in outlots will help keep pedestrians engaged and will make these larger sites fit better with surrounding smaller sites in the type bbb and bbc categories b site type bbb medium sitesclassic retail sitesmixed use  the sites in site type b are mostly between 251 and ten 10 acres in area and are located at the edges of larger type bba sites they are located on sites large enough to warrant additional consideration to landscaping and surface parking in that they can often accommodate large surface lots which can compromise the cohesiveness of the area if not designed with connectivity in mind authority and administration development regulations processes and procedures supplemental design regulations nonconformity appealsamendments 130 zoning ordinance formbased districts table of contents zoning map definitions figures & maps tables this category also includes larger singleuse developments situated nearby one another hotels single office buildings and other medium single building developments often fall into this category they often house employment centers the site type bbb category should be designed with integration in mind integration with one another with type bba sites and in support of much larger destination retail and office complex sites in type bba this will allow for better interaction between users which could lead to a more readily shared customer and tenant base and could help reduce big beaver traffic c site type bbc small sitesoutlot sites  made up mostly of lots in the two and a half 25 acre and smaller range the site type bbc category is reserved for the smallest singleuse sites developed for individually standing businesses small coffee shops or fast food restaurants would often be found in this category as well as small multitenant office buildings or singletenant office buildings site type bbc is primarily found along big beaver road in areas between the pulses of major intersections where lot depths are constrained and where older smaller buildings predominate these sites must be designed to better integrate with their surroundings to contribute to a more cohesive district a more consistent building line and more efficient access between sites good access for pedestrians and cross access for vehicles will help sites in this category reduce trips entering and existing from big beaver road groups of site type bbc properties may make excellent candidates for coordinated combination of properties to create more cohesive minidestinations 4 street types the regulating plan includes three 3 different street types described as follows a street type bba primary corridor  category bba refers to big beaver road big beaver has the widest spacing between building fronts of all roads within the formbased code area and has many unique characteristics the category is meant to reflect the world class boulevard characteristics established in the big beaver corridor study and is used in the highest profile areas of the city of troy category bba will integrate features designed to accommodate local traffic will focus on gateways and will

of the city and the region they are characterized by a narrower buildingtobuilding distance safe and effective nonmotorized pathways designed to encourage users to reach big beaver road by bike or on foot effective signage and lighting and few individual residential curb cuts the crosswalks spanning arterial roads will make use of a series of features intended to protect pedestrians by establishing equity between pedestrians and motorists design raised walks of highquality materials signage landscaping and pedestrian respite islands are several options that may be found within category bbb arterial roads will also be characterized by strong landscaping designed to mitigate the negative impacts of high traffic volumes from adjacent residential areas which provide a unique and memorable visual character for the roadway the intersections between category bba and bbb roads will be marquee places with enhanced community and corridor landmarks the spaces will be defined by a stable and consistent buildingtobuilding ratio complemented by landmark structures superior landscaping and community signage with medians and memorable architecture c street type bbc localcollector  category bbc roads are those roads tying together smaller areas within the district they have a more varied and localized character than categories bba or bbb depending on their context within predominantly office retail or residential areas they act as the backbone of smaller neighborhoods within the area and tie those areas to category bba and bbb roads category bbc roads will be very welcoming of nonmotorized users and will have defined pedestrian rest areas and other amenities wherever possible their scale will be similar to that of a main road within a conventional subdivision or industrial park and their width will be determined primarily on their purpose a category bbc road within an industrial area may be required to be wider than one 1 in a residential area although

intersections that play a critical role in the daily function image quality of life and continued viability of the city these nodes vary widely in character but share common characteristics neighborhood nodes are meant to serve as the core of the economic neighborhoods of troy identified in the master plan economic neighborhoods are destinations created as go to places that take on a social role serving both as a place to meet basic needs of the community and as 21st century village centers which can include integrated residential development the neighborhood nodes should draw people and should be visually distinguished from the surrounding area because of their greater intensity density and design design techniques such as the variation of building height shall be encouraged by these regulations to help separate the node from the surrounding area such variations however will respect the adjacent neighborhoods and will not be so extreme as to visually overpower transitional or residential areas the success of the neighborhood nodes will play a critical role in the protection and cultivation of a high quality of life in troy b regulating plan 1 the regulating plan as set forth in figure  identifies allowable uses and permissible development within the district based on location 2 the regulating plan is based on two 2 factors site type and street type site types as described in b3 are determined by lot size location and relationship to neighboring sites street types as set forth in b4 recognize that street patterns within the city of troy are established streets range from primary corridors which carry a large volume of traffic to local streets which convey lower volumes of neighborhood traffic 3 site types the regulating plan includes two 2 different site types described as follows a site type nna high intensity predominantly commercial regionally visible  these sites are predominantly located directly on major arterial roads have larger acreage than their site type nnb counterparts and have established driveways cross access and larger square footage existing buildings with commercial uses the nna category is meant to accommodate the most ambitious redevelopment within the nodes as they typically have the prime authority and administration development regulations processes and procedures supplemental design regulations nonconformity appealsamendments 151 zoning ordinance formbased districts table of contents zoning map definitions figures & maps tables location and the size to allow for the most creative solutions for mixed use and nodespecific development as outlined in the master plan while the established and intended character of each node is distinct the nna sites remain more similar to one another than do the nnb sites which are far more diverse in terms of use acreage and existing buildings while the nnb sites are intended primarily to provide a transition between the node and the adjacent residential areas the nna sites are intended to house the destination retail service and employment uses that are central to the economic neighborhoods outlined by the master plan these nna sites may also often incorporate higherdensity residential development on upper floors when possible to incubate a compact walkable environment at the node and to diversity the citys housing base b site type nnb transitional smaller scale employment based mixed use  site type nnb consolidates the smaller diverse sites at and around nodes throughout the city they are located both in support of nna sites as transitional areas between more intense nodes and the adjacent neighborhoods and on their own covering an entire node for those nodes identified in the master plan as less intense smaller scale nodes with a direct connection to a residential area while not always present between nna sites and residential neighborhoods when possible or preferable based on the parcel arrangement and existing circumstances the nnb category allows the node to develop in a tiered manner with more intense developments and uses permitted within the core of the node and less intense projects providing a buffer for the residential area nnb sites may contain a variety of uses including residential at grade in a higherdensity arrangement but may also include small scale retail and service or office uses a strong focus on transitional landscaping and a suitable connection to the neighboring residential areas is of critical concern for the nnb sites as they will often serve as the primary zone residents in a social neighborhood as identified in the master plan engage the node which serves as the core of the economic neighborhood 4 street types the regulating plan includes two 2 different street types described as follows a street type nna arterials  category nna is meant for the main northsouth and eastwest roads that intersect at each of the twentyone 21 neighborhood nodes these roads are characterized by high traffic volumes and few individual residential curb cuts they accommodate the majority of the regional traffic connect troy with its adjacent communities and serve as the primary framework for circulating throughout the city authority and administration development regulations processes and procedures supplemental design regulations nonconformity appealsamendments 152 zoning ordinance formbased districts table of contents zoning map definitions figures & maps tables the intersections of these arterial roads present opportunities to cultivate highly visible highly used areas that connect the various elements of the city and bridge the gap between the residential portions of troy with the major corridors commercial areas employment centers and adjacent communities of troy these roads will evolve over time to form complete streets which continue to accommodate regional traffic but also cater to the emerging neighborhood nodes at their intersections these roads and intersections will have welldefined crosswalks and will make use of a series of features intended to protect pedestrians by establishing equity between pedestrians and motorists design raised walks of highquality materials signage landscaping and pedestrian respite islands are several options that may be found within category nna arterial roads will also be characterized by strong landscaping designed to mitigate the negative impacts of high traffic volumes from adjacent residential areas which provide a unique and memorable visual character for the roadway b street type nnb localcollector  category nnb roads are those roads tying together smaller areas and connecting various parts of individual developments within the nodes either as public or private streets nnb streets will have a more varied and localized character than larger roads depending on their context within predominantly office retail or residential areas they act as the connection between the node and adjacent neighborhoods very few examples of streets identified as nnb streets exist in troy but they can also be developed as part of a larger project in the nn district which may require new streets to be created to adequately and successfully implement the project it is likely that any new road in the nn district will be a category nnb road category nnb roads will be very welcoming of nonmotorized users and will have defined pedestrian rest areas and other amenities whenever possible their scale will be similar to that of a main road within a conventional subdivision or industrial park and their width will be determined primarily on their purpose a category nnb road within an industrial area may be required to be wider than one in a residential area although their purpose is similar category nnb roads will have a much higher frequency of curb cuts than category nna roads and will often provide direct rear or side yard access to retail centers office complexes or high

streams and rivers thus reducing the risk of degrading vegetation wildlife wetlands and surface water systems throughout the city  3 trees and woodlands increase the economic value of land for most uses  4 tree and woodland growth protects public health absorption of air pollutants and contamination and reduces carbon dioxide content of the ambient air  and 5 tree and woodland growth serves as an essential component of the general welfare of the city by maintaining natural beauty recreation and natural heritage the purpose of this section is as follows 1 to encourage the preservation of trees and related natural resources of the woodland ecosystem on undeveloped and underdeveloped land and in connection with the development of land  2 to provide for the protection preservation proper
