findings of fact the flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation which could possibly result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the overall tax base all of which could collectively have an adverse effect on public health safety and general welfare such potential flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage may also contribute to the flood loss 2 purpose to promote the public health safety and general welfare to minimize flood losses in areas subject to flood hazards and to promote wise use of the floodplain this section has been established with the following purposes intended a to reduce the potential hazard of floods to life and property 1 prohibiting certain uses which may be dangerous to life or property during a flood 2 restricting land uses which may be hazardous to the public health during a flood 3 restricting land uses which are particularly susceptible to flood damage so as to alleviate hardship and minimize demands for public expenditures for relief and protection 4 requiring permitted floodplain uses including public facilities which serve such uses to be protected against flood by providing floodproofing and general flood protection at the time of initial construction 5 restricting or prohibiting uses which are known to be dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities 6 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction b to protect floodplain occupants from a flood which is or may be caused by their own or other land use and which is or may be undertaken without full realization of the danger 1 the prohibition of residential uses from being platted in the floodplain 2 regulating the manner in which structures designed for human occupancy may be constructed so as to prevent danger to human life within such structures 3 regulating the method of construction of water supply and sanitation systems so as to prevent disease contamination and unsanitary conditions 4 delineating and describing areas that could be inundated by floods so as to protect individuals from purchasing floodplain lands for purposes which are not in fact suitable 5 minimizing the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding which are generally undertaken at the expense of the general public 6 minimizing prolonged business interruptions 7 ensuring that potential buyers in the area are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard 8 ensuring that those who occupy flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions c to protect the public from the burden of avoidable financial expenditures for flood control and relief by 1 regulating all uses within the floodplain areas so as to produce a method of construction and a pattern of development which will minimize the probability of damage to property and loss of life or injury to the inhabitants of the flood hazard areas 2 minimizing damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard 3 helping maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development in flood hazard areas and to minimize future flood hazard areas d to protect the flood water storage capacity of floodplains and to assure retention of sufficient floodway area to convey flood flows which can reasonably be expected to occur by 1 regulating filling dumping dredging and alteration of channels by deepening widening or relocating 2 prohibiting unnecessary and damage creating encroachments  sterling codifiers inc  267449 3 encouraging uses such as agriculture recreation and parking 4 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood water elevations or velocities e to protect the hydraulic characteristics of the small watercourses including the gulches sloughs and artificial water channels used for conveying floodwaters which make up a portion of the urban drainage system by 1 regulating filling dumping and channelization so as to maintain the natural storage capacity and slow flow characteristics 2 regulating encroachment into the small watercourses to maintain their natural storage capacity and slow flow characteristics 3 encouraging uses such as greenbelt open space recreation and pedestrian and nonmotorized vehicle trails 4 controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters 5 controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase damage caused by flooding 6 preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which could divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas 3 general provisions a jurisdiction the provisions of this section shall apply to flood hazard areas within the town  b basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard the areas of special flood hazard in the town are identified by the federal emergency management agency fema in a scientific and engineering report

the criteria outlined in subsections c11a of this section are met and 2 the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety d planned unit development overlay district pud 1 purpose the pud overlay district is generally used when there is special public interest that does not coincide with the traditional zoning in a geographic area the pud overlay district may only be used when an application is not able to meet the requirements of a standard zone classification the pud is a mapped area with restrictions in addition to or less than those in the underlying traditional zone rather than attempt to create a new zoning category an overlay zone is superimposed over the traditional zone and establishes additional regulations or reduces or extends the existing uses the underlying zoning identifies permitted land uses the overlay zone may provide design restrictions additional setbacks or other exceptions to the base district regulations general purposes of a pud are as follows a establish a procedure for the development of larger parcels of land in order to reduce or eliminate the rigidity delays and inequities that otherwise would result from application of zoning standards and procedures designed primarily for small parcels b ensure orderly and thorough planning and review procedures that will result in highquality urban design c encourage variety and avoid monotony in large developments by allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access light open space and amenity d provide a mechanism for considering mixes of uses that can be made compatible by application of careful and imaginative treatment of interrelationships of activity e encourage allocation and improvement of common open space in residential areas and provide for maintenance of the open space at the expense of those who will directly benefit from it f to convert land so poorly developed as to be a public liability g encourage the preservation of serviceable existing structures of historic value or artistic merit by providing the opportunity to use them imaginatively for purposes other than that for which they were originally intended h encourage the assembly of properties that might otherwise be developed in unrelated increments to the detriment of surrounding neighborhoods i to simplify processing of development proposals for developers and the planning commission by providing for concurrent review of land use subdivision public improvements and siting considerations 2 districtspecific standards in any pud development although it is permissible to depart from literal conformance with the individuallot dimension and area regulations there shall be no variation of a the underlying zone districts maximum density requirements  b height requirements except in the rc district  c parking requirements  d loading and unloading area requirements  e public street and alley standards  f exterior lighting standards  g operational standards  h parks open space and trails dedication requirements  i natural and scenic resource protection requirements  j abandoned mine requirements  k oil and gas wells and production facility requirements  l floodplain protection  and m stormwater requirements  sterling codifiers inc  276449 the planning commission shall attach reasonable standards to insure that there shall not be a departure from the intent of this udc the pud development shall conform to such standards because a pud development is inherently more complex than individuallot development and because each such project must be tailored to the topography and neighboring uses the standards for such projects cannot be inflexible a development along the perimeter of the pud shall adhere to all required setbacks of the underlying zoning b access points to all arterial streets shall be located no more frequently than once every oneeighth 18 to a quarter of a mile the planning commission may approve the location of temporary access points c wherever there is an abrupt change in uses  ie residential to commercial  a buffer area of open space protective planting or other approved screening or combination thereof shall be placed between them which will protect each use from the undesirable effects of the other the review procedures contained in section 1076 of this title shall apply to all development in a pud overlay district  use regulations 1031 table of permitted uses table 31 of this section lists the principal uses permitted within all standard zoning districts for the pd district unless expressly modified in the pd development plan shall be as specified in

regulations of this udc including the usespecific standards set forth in this chapter and the requirements of chapter 6 of this title 2 special review uses s in a cell indicates that in the respective zoning district the use is permitted only if reviewed and approved as a special review use in accordance with the procedures of section 10713 of this title special review uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of this udc including the usespecific standards set forth in this chapter and the requirements of chapter 6 of this title 3 prohibited uses a blank cell indicates that the use is prohibited in the respective zoning district 4 usespecific standards regardless of whether a use is permitted by right or permitted as a special review use there may be additional standards that are applicable to the use usespecific standards are noted crossreference in the last column of the table crossreferences refer to section 1032 of this chapter these standards apply in all districts unless otherwise specified b table organization in subsection e table 31 of this section land uses and activities are classified under a primary use classification such as residential or commercial and then into specific use types based on common functional product or physical characteristics such as the type and amount of activity the type of customers or residents how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions this classification provides a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts this classification does not list every use or activity that may appropriately exist within the categories and specific uses may be listed in one category when they may reasonably have been listed in one or more other categories the use categories are intended merely as an indexing tool and are not regulatory c use for other purposes prohibited approval of a use listed in subsection e table 31 of this section and compliance with the applicable usespecific standards for that use authorizes that use only development or use of a property for any other use not specifically permitted in subsection e table 31 of this section and approved under the appropriate process is prohibited unless otherwise permitted as noted below d classification of new and unlisted uses notwithstanding the prohibition stated in subsection c of this section new types of land use will develop and forms of land use not anticipated may seek to locate in the town in order to provide for such situations a determination as to the appropriate classification of any new or unlisted form of land use shall be made when application is made for a use category or use type that is not specifically listed in subsection e table 31 of this section the procedure set forth below shall be followed 1 the community development director shall provide an interpretation as to the zoning classification into which such use should be placed in making such interpretation the community development director shall consider its potential impacts including but not limited to the nature of the use and whether it involves dwelling unit activity  sales  processing  type of product storage and amount and nature thereof  enclosed or open storage  anticipated employment  transportation requirements  the amount of noise odor fumes dust toxic material and vibration likely to be generated  and the general requirements for public utilities such as water and sanitary sewer 2 standards for new and unlisted uses may be interpreted as those of a similar use
