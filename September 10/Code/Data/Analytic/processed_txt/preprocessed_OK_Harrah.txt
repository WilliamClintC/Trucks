harrah are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  18103 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this part to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and

ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  dcontrol filling grading dredging and other
