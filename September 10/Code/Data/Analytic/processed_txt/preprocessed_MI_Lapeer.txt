for subdivisions set forth in land division 2 if the planning commission is not satisfied that the proposed subdivision open space plan is in compliance with this chapter or finds that the approval of said subdivision open space plan will be detrimental to existing development in the general area and should not be approved it shall communicate such disapproval to the city commission with the reasons therefor the proprietor shall be entitled to a hearing upon said proposal before the city commission upon written request filed with the clerk 3 if the city commission gives approval to the proposed subdivision open space plan it shall instruct its attorney to prepare a contract setting forth the conditions on which such approval is based which contract after approval by the city commission shall be entered into between the city and the proprietor prior to the approval of a preliminary plat a intent 1 the intent of this section is to permit the development of singlefamily residential patterns which innovation will provide for an alternative means for development of singlefamily areas to accomplish this modifications to the singlefamily residential standards as outlined in table  shall be permitted in the r2 and r3 districts 2 in r2 and r3 singlefamily residential districts the requirements of table  may be waived and the attaching of singlefamily dwelling units may be permitted subject to the standards of this section  7304 lapeer code  7305  b conditions for qualification 1 the planning commission may approve of the clustering or attaching of dwelling units on parcels of land under single ownership and control which in the opinion of the planning commission have characteristics which would make sound physical development under the normal subdivision approach impractical because of parcel size shape or dimension or because the site is located in a transitional use area or the site has natural characteristics which are worth preserving or which make platting difficult in approving an area for cluster development the planning commission shall find at least one of the following conditions to exist a the parcel to be developed has frontage on a major or secondary thoroughfare and is generally parallel to said thoroughfare and is of shallow depth as measured from the thoroughfare b the parcel has frontage on a major or secondary thoroughfare and is of a narrow width as measured along the thoroughfare which makes platting difficult c the parcel is shaped in such a way that the angles formed by its boundaries make a subdivision difficult to achieve and the parcel has frontage on a major or secondary thoroughfare d a substantial portion of the parcels perimeter is bordered by a major thoroughfare which would result in a substantial proportion of the lots of the development abutting the major thoroughfare e a substantial portion of the parcels perimeter is bordered by land that is located in other than an r singlefamily residential district or is developed for a use other than singlefamily detached homes f the parcel contains a floodplain or poor soil conditions which result in a substantial portion of the total area of the parcel being unbuildable g the parcel contains natural land forms which are so arranged that the change of elevation within the site includes slopes in excess of 10% between these elevations these elevation changes and slopes shall appear as the typical feature of the site rather than the exceptional or infrequent features of the site the topography is such that achieving road grades of less than that permitted by the city could be impossible unless the site were mass graded the providing of singlefamily clusters will in the opinion of the planning commission allow a greater preservation of the natural setting  7305 general provisions  7305  h the parcel contains natural assets which would be preserved use of cluster development such assets may include natural stands of large trees land which serves as a natural habitat for wildlife unusual topographic features or other natural assets which should be preserved 2 in order to qualify a parcel for development under 1f g or h above the planning commission shall determine that the parcel has these characteristics and the request shall be supported by written andor graphic documentation prepared by a landscape architect engineer professional community planner registered architect or environmental design professional such documentation shall include the following as appropriate soil test borings floodplain map topographic map of maximum twofoot contour interval inventory of natural assets 3 this option shall not apply to those parcels of land which have been split for the specific purpose of coming within the requirements of this cluster option section c permitted densities in a cluster development the gross densities permitted may be increased to the following maximums including streets 1 for those areas qualifying under 1a e six dwelling units per acre 2 for those areas qualifying under 1f g or h five dwelling units per acre 3 water areas within the parcel may be included in the computation of density provided that land adjacent to the water is substantially developed as open space 4 in those instances where a parcel qualifies under both 1 and 2 above the densities permitted under 1 may be permitted by the planning commission provided that the commission finds that such density is reasonable in that it does not preclude the application of 5 and does not result in the destruction or total removal of such natural assets as enumerated under 1f g or h above d development standards and requirements in areas meeting the criteria of 1 above the minimum yard setbacks heights and minimum lot sizes per unit as required by table  may be waived and the attaching of dwelling units may be accomplished subject to the following 1 the attaching of singlefamily dwelling units one to another may be permitted when said homes are attached by means of one of the following  7305 lapeer code  7305  a through a common party wall which does not have over 50% of its area in common with an abutting dwelling wall b by means of an architectural wall detail which does not form interior room space c through a common party wall in only the garage portion of adjacent structures d no other common party wall relationship is permitted and the number of units attached in this manner shall not exceed four 2 yard requirements shall be provided as follows a spacing between groups of attached dwelling units or between groups of four unattached units shall be equal to at least 20 feet in an r3 district and 15 feet in an r2 district measured between the nearest points of adjacent buildings b building setbacks from local streets shall be determined after consideration of potential vehicular traffic volume site design and pedestrian safety it is intended that setbacks for each dwelling shall be such that one car length space will be available between the garage or required offstreet parking spaces and the street pavement in determining the setbacks from local streets the planning commission may use the following guidelines  garages or required offstreet parking spaces shall not be located less than 20 feet from the rightofway of a public street unless such street or portion thereof is serving as access to not more than 16 residential units  where streets are private or the planning commission does not require the twentyfoot setback from a public rightofway garages or required offstreet parking spaces shall not be located less than 20 feet from the pavement edge of the street or the shoulder of a street c that side of a cluster adjacent to an arterial or collector street shall not be nearer to said street than 25 feet except that in those areas where topography meets the topographic conditions set forth in  7305b1g above on lands immediately adjacent to said streets having slopes in excess of 10% the front yard may be reduced by five feet but in no instance shall a structure be closer to the road rightofway line than 12 the front yard setback for the district in which it is located d any side of a cluster adjacent to a private road shall not be nearer to said road than 10 feet  7305 general provisions  7305  3 in computing the height of any individual dwelling unit in a cluster on a slope in excess of 10% and when the unit is constructed on posts the first 10 feet of height in the posts shall not be computed application of the definition of building height shall apply over and above the 10 feet of post height 4 the area in open space including subdivision recreation areas and water accomplished use of onefamily cluster shall represent

the standard would not provide substantial relief and be more consistent with justice to others   72202 general provisions  72204  3 the problem is due to circumstances unique to the property and not

still ensure that the spirit of the ordinance is observed public safety secured and substantial justice done f sign variances may be granted for any one of the following conditions 1 the applicant has demonstrated a variance is needed due to a practical difficulty on the site such as varied topography horizontal or vertical road curvature or presence of structures or desired trees that limits visibility of a sign on the premises compared to similar sites with conforming signs in the same zoning district  2 a variance is warranted due to the relatively large size of the site frontage or building in comparison to other establishments in the same zoning district  3 a variance would significantly improve the conformity of an existing sign  or 4 the variance would permit a sign with historic significance to be retained g to grant a sign variance for one of the conditions specified above in all of the following standards must also be met 1 the inability to conform with the regulations is due to a practical difficulty or unique condition that includes more than mere inconvenience or mere inability to attain a supposed higher financial return  2 that the alleged practical difficulties or unique condition or both are exceptional and peculiar to the property of the person requesting the variance and result from conditions which do not exist generally throughout the city  3 that allowing the variance will result in substantial justice being done considering the public benefits intended to be secured by the regulations the individual practical difficulties that will be suffered by a failure to grant a variance and the rights of others whose property would be affected by the allowance of the variance and will not be contrary to the public purpose and general intent
