supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 8 legislation can be tracked using the

reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered

waiver or reduction is required because imposition of such mitigation fees in full would cause inequities because prior mitigation lands have been donated findings must be based on written and other evidence submitted by the property owner substantiating the owners contention that the fee should be deferred waived or reduced findings must include facts supporting deferral waiver or reduction including without limitation findings that in the case of deferral 1 other properties to be benefitted by any fee will not be burdened by the review and delay in fee imposition and 2 alternative financing methods involving more than one owner have been proposed for review and will be approved prior to the payment of the fees in question and 3 delay will result in a more fair funding arrangement  and in the case of waiver or reduction the owner will receive insufficient or no benefit from the fee imposed and would therefore be required if the fee were imposed in full to pay more than their fair share for the benefit received  622015   exemptions the following types of construction shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter a existing improvements that are converted

determines that the writing spraying scratching etching or otherwise affixing graffiti or other inscribed materials on public or privately owned real or personal property without the consent or permission of the owner is injurious to the public health safety and welfare for the following reasons a graffiti markings are often placed on real or personal property or structures or components thereof by gangs to indicate illicit control over certain locations or areas for purposes of criminal activity b graffiti markings directly and indirectly encourage gang warfare including driveby shootings and other acts of violence that result in injuries and fatalities to gang members and innocent bystanders c graffiti markings are destructive to public and private property and cause depreciation of property values and depreciation in the value of adjacent and surrounding properties d graffiti markings result in blight and deterioration of property and business values in the community and lead to economic loss the city council also finds it necessary to enlist property owners to actively engage in immediately removing graffiti and preventing its spread in the past the city has provided unlimited free graffiti removal services while this is a valuable service to property owners the city council recognizes that such actions do not encourage property owners to deal directly with the problem of graffiti and formulate their own ideas solutions and defense strategies to prevent its spread in addition as a result of the citys limited financial resources and resulting reductions in available staff and crews directly assigned to graffiti removal the city council finds that it must develop alternative approaches to prevent the spread of graffiti in the city of colton therefore the purposes of this chapter are 1 to prohibit the defacement of public and private property with graffiti and declare graffiti to be a public nuisance  2 prohibit the possession of graffiti implements by minors  and 3 provide for the removal of graffiti and the recovery of costs incurred by the city in such removal by enacting the provisions contained herein the city council

been detained are then unavailable to carry out law enforcement duties in the field which decreases the level of police protection thereby decreasing public safety in the community one purpose of this

herein are on file and available for review in the offices of the city   purpose a the state legislature has found 1 that the waters of the state are of limited supply and are subject to ever increasing demands  2 that the continuation of californias economic prosperity is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses  3 that it is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource  4 that landscapes are essential to the quality of life in california by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water preventing erosion offering fire protection and replacing ecosystems lost to development  5 that landscape design installation maintenance and management can and should be water efficient  6 that of of the california constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use b consistent with the legislative findings the purpose of this model ordinance is to 1 promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that integrate and go beyond the conservation and efficient use of water  2 establish a structure for planning designing installing maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that requires crosssector collaboration of industry government and property owners to achieve the many benefits possible  3 establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing landscapes  4 use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied water allowance as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount  5 promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with neighboring local and regional agencies  6 encourage local agencies and water purveyors to use economic incentives that promote the efficient use of water such as implementing a tieredrate structure  and 7 encourage local agencies to designate the necessary authority that implements and enforces the provisions of the model water efficient landscape its local landscape ordinance c landscapes that are planned designed installed managed and maintained with the watershed based approach can improve californias environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability goals such landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face of climatic extremes consistent with the legislative findings and purpose of the conditions in the urban setting will be improved by 1 creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing compaction incorporating organic matter that increases water retention and promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon storage oxygen production shade habitat and esthetic benefits 2 minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water requirements reducing reliance on petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides and planting climate appropriate shade trees in urban areas 3 conserving water by capturing and reusing rainwater and graywater wherever possible and selecting climate appropriate plants that need minimal supplemental water after establishment 4 protecting air and water quality by reducing power equipment use and landfill disposal trips selecting recycled and locally sourced materials and using compost mulch and efficient irrigation equipment to prevent erosion 5 protecting existing habitat and creating new habitat by choosing local native plants climate

the amended provisions for reference purposes   statutory authorization the legislature of the state of california has in government  and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the city does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations  472015   findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss  472015   statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruptions  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  g ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  472015   methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due t water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas  472015   definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage

nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  472015   appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with

during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency  472015   conditions for ordinances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in  of this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in  of this chapter to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a e are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance g upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the city council

maintain and increase their net operating income from year to year in accordance with of this chapter a89  107c 4 1989   rebutting the presumption it may be determined that the base year net operating income yielded other than a fair return on property in which case the base year net operating income may be adjusted accordingly in order to make such a determination the hearing officer must make at least one of the following findings a the owners operating and maintenance expenses in the base year were unusually high or low in comparison to other years in such instances adjustments may be made in calculating such expenses so the base year operating expenses reflect average expenses for the property over a reasonable period of time the hearing officer shall consider the following factors 1 the owners made substantial capital improvements during 1986 which were not reflected in the rent levels on the base date  2 substantial repairs were made due to damage caused by natural disaster or vandalism which management has taken appropriate action to reduce  3 maintenance and repair was below accepted standards so as to cause significant deterioration in the quality of housing services  4 other expenses were unreasonably high or low not withstanding the following of prudent business measures b the rental rates on the base date were disproportionate due to enumerated factors below in such instances adjustments may be made in calculating gross rents consistent with the purpose of this chapter 1 the rental rates on the base date were substantially higher or lower than in preceding months by reason of premiums being charged or rebates being given for reasons unique to particular units or limited to the period determining the base rent 2 the rent on the base date was substantially higher or lower than at other times of the year by reason of seasonal demand or seasonal variations in rent 3 the rental rates on the base date were exceptionally high or low due to other factors which would cause the application of the base year net operating income to result in gross inequity to either the owner or tenant  1991  a89  107c5 1989   determination of base year net operating income a to determine the net operating income during the base year there shall be deducted from the annualized gross income being realized in 198 a sum equal to the actual operating expenses for calendar year 198 unless the owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the hearing officer that some other consecutive twelvemonth period is justified by reason consistent with the purpose of articles v and vi of this chapter b in the event the owner did not own the subject property during the base year the operating expenses for 1986 shall be determined by one of the following methods whichever the hearing officer determines to be more reliable in the particular case 1 the previous owners actual operating expenses as defined in c if such figures were available  or 2 actual operating expenses for the first calendar year of ownership discounted to 1986 by the schedule in of this chapter a89  107c6 1989   determination of current year net operating income to determine the current year net operating income there shall be deducted from the annualized gross income determined by annualizing the monthly rents in effect at the time of filing of a petition a sum equal to the actual operating expenses for the last calendar year unless the owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the hearing officer that some other consecutive twelvemonth period is justified by reasons consistent with the purposes of this section a89  107c7 1989   schedule of increases in operating expenses where scheduling of rental increases or other calculations require projections of income and expenses it shall be assumed that operating expenses exclusive of property taxes and management expenses increases at five percent per year that property taxes increase at two percent per year and that management expenses constitute five percent of gross income a89  107c8 1989   allowable special rent adjustment the commission may permit special rent adjustments unless otherwise prescribed by law such that the owners net operating income will be increased at the rate of sixty percent of the percentage increase in the consumer price index cpi over the base year the cpi for the base year shall be determined by use of the monthly figure for january 1987 january 1987 cpi   1134 for purposes of initiating a special rent adjustment the percentage increase in the cpi shall be calculated by dividing the most recently reported monthly cpi figure at the time of receipt of the owners petition for increase by 1134 the percentage increase in the cpi is the amount by which the resulting figure exceeds a base of 100 for example if the most recently reported monthly cpi figure at the time of receipt of the owners petition for increase were 1284 the percentage increase in the cpi would be thirteen percent 1284  1134   113  113  100 base   13% so that the hearing officer could permit in such instance an increase in the owners net operating income of up to 78 percent maximum allowable

commission may consider increased costs associated with refinancing of mortgage or debt when such costs are limited to increases in interest payments from those interest payments made during the base year which result from either 1 refinancing of the outstanding principal owed for the acquisition of a park where such refinancing is mandated by the terms of a financing transaction entered into prior to  eg termination of a loan with a balloon payment  or 2 increased interest costs incurred as a result of a variable interest rate loan used to finance the acquisition of the park and entered into prior to  b special rent adjustments based upon increased costs associated with refinancing shall be allowed only where the owner can show that the terms of the refinancing were reasonable and consistent with prudent business practices under the circumstances to the extent that refinancing does not benefit the subject park eg amounts of money are being used for the purpose of leveraging other investments rather than benefiting the park such amount shall not be considered  1991   limit on special rent adjustments pending hearing or litigation notwithstanding any other provisions of
