in a higher incident of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than workers in other establishments including a very high incidence of illegal prostitution or engaging in lewdness in violation of of the florida statutes operation without occupational licenses and illegal unlicensed massage v the practice of not paying or paying low wages to workers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and requiring them to earn their entire or most of their income from tips or gratuities from their customers who are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in an extremely high nearly universal incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers w sexually oriented businesses involve activities that are pure conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a profit rather than speech or expressive activity and therefore are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health welfare and safety of the community x requiring sexually oriented businesses to post a listing of services provided and restrict services to those listed as well as maintaining a transaction record in a daily register will discourage incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution thereby further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and will assist facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal acts do occur y sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments lead themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the establishments or businesses further there are presently no mechanisms or inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses

cc according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts dd sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities ee numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments where persons view adult oriented films ff removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters gg the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases hh it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to protect minors to assure correct identification of persons working in establishments to enable the effective deployment of law enforcement personnel to notify workers of conduct that is permitted and prohibited under this chapter and to detect and discourage the involvement of organized crime in the adult entertainment and sexually oriented business industry to have available for inspection from operators of establishments a limited amount of information regarding certain workers who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity the findings made herein raise important substantial and compelling governmental concerns sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have

drainage and development of land has a significant adverse impact upon the health safety and welfare of the indian harbour beach community further the city council finds more specifically as follows 1 stormwater runoff is capable of carrying pollutants into receiving bodies thereby degrading water quality  2 the increase in nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of receiving water bodies thereby adversely affecting flora and fauna  3 improperly channeling water increases the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing erosion and sedimentation  4 construction requiring the alteration of natural topography and removal of vegetation tends to increase erosion  5 siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases the capacity of such water bodies to hold and transport water interferes with navigation and harms flora and fauna  6 impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff and allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge  7 improperly managed stormwater runoff may increase the incidents of flooding and the level of floods which occur thereby endangering property and human life  8 improperly managed stormwater runoff may interfere with the maintenance of optimum salinity in estuarine areas thereby disrupting biological productivity  9 substantial economic losses may result from such adverse impacts upon the waters of the citys ecosystem  10 sound stormwater utility management practices result in the avoidance of future problems concerning the development of land and the maintenance of the quality of the citys environment b the purpose of this chapter is to protect maintain and enhance both the immediate and longterm health safety and
