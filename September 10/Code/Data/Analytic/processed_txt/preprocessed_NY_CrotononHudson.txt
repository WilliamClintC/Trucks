effect upon the use and enjoyment of adjacent areas special regulation of these business uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of

economic social and moral character of the existing community and adversely affect existing businesses and community and family life of particular concern is the location of these uses in areas where our youth may regularly assemble as other business activity drops off and the quality of life deteriorates merchants and families move away from the area leaving it in a vacant and depressed state c

slopes so as to maintain and protect the natural terrain and its vegetative features preserve wetlands water bodies and watercourses prevent flooding protect important scenic views and vistas preserve areas of wildlife habitat provide safe building sites and protect adjoining property by preventing surface erosion creep and sudden slope failure in this connection the village board finds as follows a protection of steep slopes is a matter of concern to the entire village the establishment of regulatory and conservation practices to prevent disturbance of steep slopes is needed to protect the public health safety and general welfare experience has demonstrated a need for effective protection of steep slopes including careful review and regulation and the implementation of stringent mitigation measures where in the opinion of the approving authority no practicable alternative to such disturbance exists however in all cases where the approving authority determines that total avoidance of steep slopes is not practicable such disturbance should constitute the minimum disturbance necessary to ensure the property owner a reasonable use of his property b the improperly managed disturbance of steep slopes can aggravate erosion and sedimentation beyond rates experienced in natural geomorphological processes erosion and sedimentation often include the loss of topsoil a valuable natural resource and can result in the disturbance of habitats degradation of the quality of surface water alteration of drainage patterns the gullying of land obstruction of drainage structures and intensification of flooding both on and off the subject site c the inadequately controlled disturbance of steep slopes can lead to the failure of slopes and the mass movement of earth danger to the natural environment manmade structures and the safety of persons and the degradation of aesthetics d steep slopes including vegetation and rock outcroppings located thereon are important environmental features that contribute significantly to the visual impression one forms while traveling onhudson areas that are highly visible from the roadways are particularly important in maintaining the villages semirural character overdevelopment of or improperly managed disturbance to these areas are detrimental to the visual character of the village e regulation of disturbance to steep slopes is consistent with the legitimate interests of landowners to make reasonable use of their land  1951 sewers  1951   1952 definitions as used in this chapter the following terms shall have

legislative findings it is hereby determined that  1962 purpose and objectives the purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing within this jurisdiction and to address the legislative findings in  1961 hereof this article seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives a land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species c clearing grading excavating soil disturbance or placement of fill during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat d improper design maintenance and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the village g stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities h the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety i regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development  1961 stormwater drainage erosion and  1962   1963 applicability a meet the requirements of

constitutes the water supply protection rules and regulations of the village of crotononhudson  22316 purpose  22317 groundwater zones a the village of crotononhudsons water supply is obtained from sand and gravel deposits laid down in the croton river valley this valleyfill aquifer is the primary source of drinking water for the village of crotononhudson and is located in the northern portion of the village the area which contributes water to this aquifer includes parts of both the village of crotononhudson and the town of cortlandt b river valley aquifers usually underlie the river and form a band on either side of the stream these bands extend for varying distances upstream of smaller tributaries groundwater flow in valleyfill aquifers is generally toward the river which forms the discharge point groundwater flow patterns are modified by pumping wells which create a cone of influence c pollution of groundwater is more difficult to clean up than pollution of surface water groundwater is afforded little dilution because of the laminar flow which resists mixing and because of the slow movement where water is withdrawn from the ground and then returned for disposal as with subsurface sewage disposal contaminants accumulate in the groundwater d normal domestic activities both residential and commercial result in the discharge on a widespread basis of small quantities of nondegradable metals salts hydrocarbons nitrates and other toxic substances even small quantities of soluble organic chemical substances when discharged at or below the land surface can migrate to the water table and seriously contaminate the groundwater limitations of future developmental density and strict management of the use of the land in the village of crotononhudson and the town of cortlandt specifically in the areas adjacent to the croton river and the well field are essential to control potential pollutants and prevent degradation of drinking water quality e the purpose of this to preserve protect and maintain the existing purity and quality of the groundwater within the village of crotononhudson it will establish protective land use regulations for the watershed affecting the well field  22315 vehicles unlicensed motordriven  22317  a there are three zones affecting the quality of the aquifer and a degree of regulation or management for each is required if the water supply source is to be protected from contamination the three zones are defined as follows and are hereby established in the map entitled zones of groundwater protection crotononhudson well field which is hereby made a part of this is to be kept on file in the village office of the village of crotononhudson amended 571990 by ll no 21990 1 zone 1 the wellhead protection area including the cone of influence 2 zone 2 the recharge area of the aquifer 3 zone 3 the watershed area tributary to the recharge area b this threezone system will be superimposed on existing land use zones the requirements of the underlying districts shall continue to apply permitted uses except where prohibited by this shall also continue to apply in the event of conflict between this any other regulation the more restrictive requirements shall control c the wellhead protection area is defined to be zone 1 in the map entitled zones of groundwater protection crotononhudson well field and includes at a minimum the area within 200 feet of the well and the cone of influence amended 571990 by ll no 21990 d the cone of influence is created when the drawdown caused by pumping of the groundwater creates a pressure gradient which induces a flow of groundwater toward the well any contaminant that reaches the groundwater within this cone of influence will be drawn to the well this cone of influence may cause a disruption of the normal groundwater flow patterns because water normally flowing parallel to the well or downgradient from the well may be directed toward the well e additional protection is needed for groundwater supplies which are vulnerable to contaminantgenerating activities outside the wellhead protection area such as area and river valley aquifers where the waterbearing formations extend to the surface controls over the recharge area and the watershed tributary surface water to the recharge area are needed f the recharge area is the area where precipitation rapidly infiltrates into the ground and into an aquifer where it will flow towards the points of withdrawal such aquifers are characterized by waterbearing deposits of sand and gravel with high permeability and porosity any contaminantproducing activity in this area will travel rapidly to the groundwater g river valley aquifers are replenished not only by direct infiltration of precipitation but also by runoff from that portion of the watershed  22317 crotononhudson code  22317   22318 sources of contamination tributary to the recharge area an area composed of relatively impervious consolidated and unconsolidated material typically runoff flows overland and in defined stream beds until reaching the recharge area where it seeps underground in large streams water may flow recharge area in times of high water tables and high flows the large stream will generally have a continuous flow of water the exchange between surface and ground water will take place either to the stream or to the aquifer depending upon water conditions the location of withdrawal points and the relative size of withdrawals a water supply sources are subjected to contaminants from the following sources 1 wastewater discharges to surface and ground water 2 improper handling and disposal of waste material 3 improper handling storage and use of materials which are or may be contaminating 4 accidental spills of contaminating material from storage during transit or during use 5 water land and air resource use which may adversely affect water quality b public water supply sources have been contaminated in numerous instances because of systems facilities and activities which were not properly managed or were not appropriately located in relation to public water supply sources the people of the state of new york have a right to expect and the new york state commissioner of health and westchester county commissioner of health are obligated to see that every reasonable precaution and measure is taken to protect water supply sources from contamination and that safe drinking water is available from public water supply sources and systems amended 571990 by ll no 21990 c the aquifer protection is hereby extended over the entire watershed as delineated in the map entitled zones of groundwater protection crotononhudson well field the severest
