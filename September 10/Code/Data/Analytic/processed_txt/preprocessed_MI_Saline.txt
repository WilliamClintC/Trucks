footnotes  1  cross reference businesses ch 22 article i  video providers footnotes  2  editors note adopted  amended the repealing former art i  3013029 and adding a new art i former art i pertained to franchise regulations and derived from adopted   and adopted  title and purpose a short title this article shall be known as the city of saline video providers  b declaration of findings and purpose 1 the city council finds that cable systems permanently occupy and extensively make use of scarce and valuable city public rightsofway in a manner different from the way in which the general public uses them video service providers also travel city streets and rightsofway in order to transact local business the city council finds that public convenience safety and general welfare can best be served by exercising the police powers vested in the city to protect the public and to ensure that any video franchise which issues is operated in the public interest 2 further the city finds that the average american home has a television on for nearly eight 8 hours per day this average is much higher than the average time listening to the radio or surfing the internet consequently video emergency alerts should be included in any effort made by the city to distribute emergency messages affecting city residents 3 further it is determined that wireline competition in the delivery of video and other services delivered by cable systems is desired by the city as such competition will lower prices for city residents improve customer service and increase innovation 4 further while competition in the delivery of cable services is desired and encouraged no wireline cable competition currently exists within the city as a consequence cable prices in the city continue to increase at a pace greater than inflation the regulation of customer service in the city is still deemed necessary due to a significant number of complaints and a low level of relative customer satisfaction prevails 5 further attacks on the public while congregated within public spaces and attacks on children while at school have recently occurred at a disturbing rate and it is imperative that the city require the development of cable systems that are reasonably capable of delivering emergency information to these public spaces 6 further the frequency of inperson interactions between a video service providers employees and its subscribers will increase as video service providers continue to offer a greater number of services to subscribers 7 given the lack of wireline cable competition in the city the city finds that it can improve and protect the general welfare and public interest of city residents by adopting policies and regulations pursuant to the citys police powers which regulate the manner in which cable operators transact local business within the city 8 in light of the foregoing the following goals among others underlie the provisions set forth in this chapter a cable should be available to as many city residents as possible b wireline cable competition should be encouraged and should be made available to as many city residents as possible c cable systems within the city should be constructed in a manner that permits the city to interrupt video programming in the event that an emergency message needs to be transmitted to city residents d cable systems within the city should be constructed in a manner that permits emergency messages and other information related to public safety to be exchanged privately between public buildings including police and fire stations e cable systems within the city should be constructed in a manner that permits the delivery of emergency messages to public classrooms and other public spaces where the public congregates and televisions may regularly be in use f video service providers should not utilize the public rightsofway to transact local business in the city in a manner which may deprive city subscribers of rights and interests that they may otherwise enjoy under the law g a cable operator should pay fair compensation to the city for the occupation and use of the local public rightsofway c the city council intends that all provisions set forth in this chapter be construed broadly to serve the public interest and the foregoing public purposes and that any franchise which may issue be construed to include the foregoing findings and public purposes as integral parts thereof  definitions for the purpose of this article the following terms phrases words and their derivations shall have the meaning given

vehicles and buildings and persons performing essential utility traffic control and emergency services 2 newsracks so located as to cause an inconvenience or danger to persons using public rightsofway and unsightly newsracks located therein constitute public nuisances 3 it is a matter of public necessity that the city protect children and unconsenting adults in and on its public streets sidewalks transportation facilities and other public rightsofway from viewing public displays of offensive sexual material such displays are thrust indiscriminately upon unwilling audiences of adults and children and constitute assaults upon individual privacy 4 these factors constitute an unreasonable interference with and obstruction of the use of public rightsofway constitute an unwarranted invasion of individual privacy are injurious to health offensive to the senses and constitute such an obstruction of the free use of property as to interfere in the comfortable enjoyment of life and property by the entire community 5 the council recognizes however that the use of such rightsofway is so historically associated with the sale and distribution of newspapers and publications that access to those areas for such purposes should not be absolutely denied the council further finds that these strong and competing interests require a reasonable accommodation which can only be

dfbc intent the zoning ordinance regulates the intensity and use of development which is appropriate in most parts of the city there are also areas within the city in which the master plan places greater emphasis on regulating form and character of development as well as use and intensity of use the downtown formbased dfbc districts use formbased provisions to accomplish this with a special sensitivity to the contextual relevance of two unique downtown subdistricts within the overall dfbc this unique zoning district allows the city to regulate land use in a more flexible format for this specific area to encourage a viable dynamic mix of uses physically the dfbc is intended to promote a unified vision for supporting the historic commercial core of the city of saline focused on increased and maintained land use intensity and improved public amenities that are oriented as much to the needs of the pedestrian as to those of the automobile the flexibility in use regulation inherent in the overall dfbc regulations paired with the prescriptive physical development regulations in the section will result in a compact walkable environment that creates new opportunities for investment while protecting quality attributes of the existing area specifically the dfbc will do the following a ensure that development is of human scale primarily pedestrianoriented and designed to create attractive streetscapes and pedestrian spaces b promote mixeduse development in both a horizontal and vertical form c ensure reasonable transition between higher intensity development and adjacent neighborhoods d provide economic development opportunities by allowing a wider range of potential uses and creative redevelopment techniques that will expand the employment base and value of land e provide a simple predictable efficient way to allow complex innovative development that would otherwise require special planning procedures f encourage the incubation of a residential element within the traditional downtown to foster a 24hour community g establish a development pattern in which new buildings and building modifications enhance the character of the existing built environment h orient building entrances and storefronts to the street to add visual interest put eyes on the street for enhanced crime surveillance increase pedestrian traffic and create memorable outdoor spaces i limit the impact of offstreet parking areas which interrupt the flow and consistency of the street wall j enhance a sense of place and contribute to the sustainability of the city k allow a pattern of development which will encourage transportation alternatives walking biking and transit l visually distinguish the downtown from the rest of saline by encouraging full use of property consistency and density while respecting adjacent residential areas  121712 applicability and organization any new use structure or expansion of an existing use or structure unless otherwise noted herein shall

by means of the smallest square circle rectangle triangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing representation emblem or other display together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop of structure against which it is placed but not including any supporting framework bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself where a sign has two or more faces the area of all faces shall be included in determining the total area of the sign a twofaced sign may include a v or wing type sign with the condition that the interior angle of the v not exceed 45 degrees to limit the visibility of the sign from a single viewing position if the interior angle of the twosided v type sign exceeds 45 degrees the sign will be considered a singlesided sign and not a double sided sign for the purpose of calculating sign area 2 computation of height the height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of a existing grade prior to construction  or b the newly established grade after construction exclusive of any filling berming mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign in cases where the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the

derived from adopted  article 14  access management intent the mdot has jurisdiction within the highways rightofway while the city has authority for land use and site plan decisions within individual parcels along the highway the access management standards were created to help ensure a collaborative process between the mdot and the city on access decisions along us12 to implement the recommendations of the us12 corridor access management plan and other adopted city plans such as the michigan avenue gateway strategic plan applicability the standards of this section shall apply to all lands with frontage along us12 and along adjacent streets within 100 feet of the us12 rightofway the standards herein apply in addition to and simultaneously with the other applicable regulations of the zoning ordinance permitted and special land uses on these lands shall be as regulated in the applicable zoning district as designated on the zoning map and shall meet the following additional provisions 1 the number of access points is the fewest needed to allow motorists reasonable access to the site 2 access spacing from intersections and other driveways shall meet the us12 access management standards and mdots guidelines 3 provision has been made to share access with adjacent uses either now or in the future including any necessary written shared access and maintenance

herein is demonstrated 6 any change in use that requires a site plan review per article 8 shall identify the extent of compliance with the standards herein and shall submit information to the mdot to determine if a new access permit is required 7 for building or parking lot expansions or changes in use the planning commission shall determine the extent of upgrades to bring the site into greater compliance with the access standards in making its decision the planning commission shall consider the existing and projected traffic conditions any sight distance limitations site topography or natural features impacts on internal site circulation and any recommendations from the mdot required improvements may include removal or rearrangement or redesign of site access points 8 the standards herein were developed collaboratively between the city and mdot where conflict occurs the more restrictive standards shall apply additional submittal information in addition to the submittal information required for site plan review in article 8 the following shall be provided with any application for site plan or special land use review the information listed in items 14 below shall be

site 7 traffic impact study a traffic impact study is a specialized study which assesses the effects that a particular developments traffic will have on the surrounding transportation network a traffic impact study will vary in range and complexity depending on the type and size of the proposed development such a study will determine the potential need for transportation improvements due to the changes in projected traffic and traffic movements submittal of a traffic impact study may be required for any special land use that would be expected to generate 100 or more vehicle trips during any peak hour or 1000 or more vehicle trips daily or where modifications from the generally applicable access spacing standards are requested the traffic impact study shall be prepared by a firm or individual that is a member of the institute of transportation engineers with demonstrated experience in production of such studies the methodology and analysis of the study shall be in accordance with accepted principles as described in the handbook evaluating traffic impact studies a recommended practice for michigan developed by the mdot and other michigan transportation agencies the city

coordination the applicant shall provide correspondence that the preliminary site plan has been submitted to the mdot for their information and comment any correspondence from the mdot on the general access design and geometrics not approval shall be considered during the preliminary and final site plan review processes the city may request attendance at coordination meetings with representatives of the mdot once a final site plan has been approved by the city the applicant shall request an access permit from mdot the approval of a land division or site plan does not negate the responsibility of an applicant to subsequently secure access permits from the mdot access management standards access points not including driveways that serve a single family home duplex or essential service facility structure shall meet the following standards these standards are based on considerable research in michigan and nationally and were prepared concurrent with guidelines promoted by the mdot 1 each lot shall be permitted one access point this access point may consist of an individual driveway a shared access with an adjacent use or access via a service drive or frontage road as noted above land divisions shall not be permitted that may prevent compliance with the access location standards 2 an additional driveway may be permitted by the planning commission upon finding the conditions a and b or c and d below exist the additional driveway may be required to be along a side street or a shared access with an adjacent site a the site has a frontage of over 660 feet and the spacing standards between access points listed below are met and b the additional access will not prevent adjacent lands from complying with the access spacing standards when such lands develop or redevelop in the future or c a traffic impact study prepared in accordance with accepted practices as described in this chapter demonstrates the site will generate over 300 trips in a peak hour or 3000 trips daily or 400 and 4000 respectively if the site has access to a traffic signal and minimum driveway spacing measurement d the traffic study demonstrates the additional driveway will provide improved conditions for the motoring public and will not create negative impacts on flow 3 access points shall provide the following spacing from other access points along the same side of the public street measured from centerline to centerline as shown on the figure based on the posted speed limit along the public street segment required spacing along us12 is greater than other roadways to acknowledge mdot access guidelines and that their primary function is to accommodate while the function of other roads is more balanced with access to properties minimum offset spacing posted speed limit mph along us 12 feet intersecting streets feet 35 or less 245 150 40 300 185 45 350 230 50 455 275 55 455 350  unless greater spacing is required by mdot or required to meet other standards herein 4 where the subject site adjoins land that may be developed or redeveloped in the future including adjacent lands or potential outlots the access shall be located to ensure the adjacent sites can also meet the access location standards in the future 5 access points along sections of us12 with an existing or planned median shall be located in consideration of existing or approved median crossovers a sufficient length for weaving across travel lanes and storage within the median shall be provided consistent with mdot published standards the city supports mdot policies to limit the number of median crossovers to maintain traffic flow and reduce the potential for accidents in some cases existing median cuts may need to be redesigned to meet current design standards 6 access points shall be aligned with driveways on the opposite side of the street or offset a minimum of 250 feet centerline to centerline the planning commission may reduce this to not less than 150 feet where each of the opposing access point generates less than 50 trips inbound and outbound during the peak hour of the public street or where sight distance limitations exist driveway spacing from intersections 7 minimum spacing of access points from intersections shall be in accordance with the table below measured from pavement edge to pavement edge as shown on the figure signalized locations along us 12 300 feet along other public streets 200 feet unsignalized locations along us 12 300 feet intersections with us 12 300 feet other intersections 150 feet  spacing shown for signalized intersections shall also be applied at intersections where mdot indicates spacing and approach volumes may warrant a signal in the future 8 where direct access consistent with the various standards above cannot be achieved access should be via a shared driveway or service drive and or side street in particular the planning commission may require development of frontage roads or rear service drives where such facilities can provide access to signalized locations where service drives may minimize the number of driveways and as a means to ensure that traffic is able to more efficiently and safely ingress and egress frontage roads or service drives shall be constructed in accordance with the following standards frontage road minimum setbacks a service drives and frontage roads shall be set back as far as reasonably possible from the intersection of the access driveway with the public street a minimum of 25 feet shall be maintained between the public street rightofway and the pavement of the frontage road with a minimum 60 feet of throat depth provided at the access point b the alignment of the service drive can be refined to meet the needs of the site and anticipated traffic conditions provided the resulting terminus allows the drive to be extended adjacent sites this may require use of aerial photographs property line maps topographic information and other supporting documentation rear service drive design c in cases where a shared access facility is recommended but is not yet available temporary direct access may be permitted provided the plan is designed to accommodate the future service drive and a written agreement is submitted that the temporary access will be removed by the applicant when the alternative access system becomes available this may require posting of a financial performance guarantee 9 driveways shall be located to provide safe sight distance or determined by the applicable road agency 10 no driveway shall interfere with municipal facilities such as street light or traffic signal poles signs fire hydrants cross walks bus loading zones utility poles fire alarm supports drainage structures or other necessary street structures the zoning administrator is authorized to order and effect the removal or reconstruction of any driveway which is constructed in conflict with street structures the cost of reconstructing or relocating such driveways shall be at the expense of the abutting property owner application to existing sites and modification of standards modifications by planning commission given the variation in existing physical conditions along the corridor modifications to the spacing and other standards above may be permitted by the planning commission as part of the site plan review process upon a finding that the following conditions apply 1 practical difficulties exist on the site that make compliance unreasonable sight distance limitations topography wetlands drain or water body woodlands that will be preserved existing development existing nonconforming width unique site configuration or shape or existing offsite access points make it impractical to fully comply with the standards 2 the use involves an access improvement to an existing site or a new use that will not generate any more traffic than the previous use or there is only one access point that is not being changed 3 the proposed modification is consistent with the general intent of the preceding standards the recommendations of the us12 corridor access management plan in the citys master plan andor the michigan avenue corridor preservation plan mdot guidelines and both city and mdot staff support the proposed access design 4 if deemed necessary by the planning commission a traffic study by a qualified traffic engineer has been provided that certifies the modification will improve traffic operations and safety along us12 and is not simply for convenience of the development roadway or intersection control or driveway design change improvements will be made to improve overall traffic operations prior to the project completion or occupancy of the first building 5 indirect or shared access has been provided to the extent practical the decision of the planning commission may be appealed to the zoning board of appeals in consideration of this variance the board shall also apply the standards above in addition to the other variance article 15  nonconforming uses structures and lots intent certain existing lots structures and uses of lots and structures were lawful before this ordinance was adopted

nonconforming use of the same or a more restricted classification provided that the board of appeals either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use in permitting such change the board of appeals may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the purpose and intent of this ordinance where a nonconforming use of a structure land or structure and land in combination is hereafter changed to a more restrictive classification it shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted classification repairs and maintenance on any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use work may be done in any period of 12
