facilities it is the city of vestavia hills express intent that the construction of new towers be an option of last resort  to the greatest extent feasible location of antennae on existing towers and other suitable structures should first be sought these standards are designed to ensure the compatibility of towers with and avoid adverse impacts to nearby properties and discourage the proliferation of towers throughout the city  applicability all telecommunication facilities are subject to these standards and to statutory review by the commission and council in accordance with of the alabama 197 as amended anything contained in this the contrary notwithstanding telecommunications facilities are conditional uses which require approval by the council  objectives the proposed locations and

rightofway given the topography of the proposed site and surrounding area 3 land use compatibility the proposed facility will be compatible with the surrounding land uses given the character of the use and development of the location 4 design harmony the proposed facility will be designed in harmony with the natural setting and the surrounding development pattern as well as to the highest industry standards 5 existing communication services the proposed facility will comply with fcc and other applicable standards so as not to interfere with existing communication services in the area 6
