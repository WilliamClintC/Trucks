registration and inspections adopted 7172017  1471 purpose the city intends to hold owners of multifamily dwellings accountable and responsible for the maintenance of safe living conditions by establishing a multifamily dwelling unit registration and inspections program many owners form limited liability companies and other various forms of proprietorships in order to have undisclosed and unidentifiable principals many individuals no longer have landlines and communicate mainly with cell phones which are mostly unlisted this makes the effort to locate the persons who owns the property extremely difficult and very time consuming by requiring the disclosure of ownership it provides a transparency to the citizens of saco and enables city officials to perform their duties the city intends to improve safety and sanitary living conditions for the residents of multifamily dwellings by establishing a program of regular inspections of such properties office the city seeks to assure properties come into compliance with current life safety codes and standards and that owners are alerted to any detrimental conditions that could place tenants at risk the city intends to work cooperatively and proactively with owners of such properties by setting a protocol for regular inspections as well as providing owners with clear standards for maintenance of their properties the city recognizes the public safety benefits of centrally monitored fire alarm systems and sprinkler systems by offering discounts for buildings that contain such systems  1472 findings multifamily properties comprise almost 25% of the housing stock in the city of saco and it is estimated that over 20% of city residents live within one of these units typically these properties are older and were built prior to the enactment of todays rigorous life safety codes in addition the city does not currently have a regular inspection program for such properties based on various risk factors such as the age of the existing housing stock the housing stock consisting of mainly wood frame construction and the lack of a proactive inspection program make the residents vulnerable to a significant life safety event fires in nearby communities where multiple fatalities have occurred affirm the importance of periodic safety inspections for these types of properties  1473 authority this proposed

of which is commonly called the saco auto mile substantial numbers of people many from outside saco and even some from outside of maine come to saco to see cars and shop at the auto mile these visitors can and do spend money throughout the community and the economic effect of the auto mile is both significant and beneficial to the city the corridor provides jobs for citizens results in direct taxes paid to the city and promotes income for other businesses located in the area the council finds that an economic cluster has been created here around the automobile industry including establishments involved in sales repair parts sales rental transportation and other aspects of the automotive industry the council also finds that autorelated businesses located within the auto mile

b the party has increased its employment at its saco office by at least one halftime position over the prior year or 2 that it has increased the number of vehicles it registered in saco by 5% over the prior year or 3 that it has registered at least 100 vehicles over the course of the year or 4 that it has expanded its operations and physical facilities within saco by $25000 in new property value a the city of saco has been blessed with a beautiful beach and beachfront residential community running from camp ellis to the border of old orchard beach at kinney shores sacos beachfront is an historic vibrant and diverse community the area bounded by the saco river a wildlife refuge of national significance a state park as well as the goosefare brook estuary is an ecological marvel it is one of the most desirable places in the city to both live and visit many people visit summer after summer enjoying the opportunity to live even temporarily in this wonderful beachfront community b comprehensive zoning and wetlands rules protect this area by limiting growth and development presently this is the citys most restrictive zone in part so that its beauty and unique residential atmosphere is adequately preserved the city recognizes however that many properties in the area have a long history of being rented for the summer season moreover many property owners in the beachfront area have come to depend on the supplemental income generated by  1725 saco city code  1731   1732 applicability these seasonal rentals thus while such rentals are beneficial to particular property owners they are simultaneously a burden upon the residential character of the area and produce an impact on a sensitive environment c of particular concern to the city is that seasonal rentals are occurring in properties which were designed and built as singlefamily homes not as transient rental units further many of these properties were built years before life safety and building codes came into enactment the city believes and has found that seasonal rentals no matter where found pose a substantial safety risk to our visitorguests no city official has ever inspected those properties for adequate ingress egress for fire extinguishers for smoke detectors for adequate electrical systems etc the city presently inspects every multiunit building hotel motel bedandbreakfast in the city but has never inspected seasonal rentals the council believes that the mere fact that properties in our community rented only for a short season does not mean that fire safety review and compliance is unnecessary on the contrary given the age and date of construction of many of these homes inspection is of great import and should begin as soon as possible d finally the council has found that not only are there more seasonal rentals occurring than previously believed but no limitations on occupancy are in place in one recent case the city learned of a singlefamily home being advertised as sleeping 14 such overburdening of properties places lives in jeopardy and affects surrounding residences adversely the council believes such use of property regardless of location within the city poses a risk to our visitorguests e therefore the council has found and determined that the welfare of visitorguests to our community requires the city license review and inspect lawful nonconforming properties offered for seasonal rental therefore pursuant to the citys home rule authority 30amrsa  300 as well its inherent powers to protect the health safety and welfare of those within its borders the city enacts the following ordinance provisions a those covered any person entity business partnership corporation etc which offers for lease or rents any singlefamily twofamily and multifamily dwelling units for periods of six days to four months in duration shall secure a seasonal rental license from the officer this chapter applies to all properties whether that portion of time is broken into a monthly weekly or other rental period of time only singlefamily twofamily and multifamily dwelling units within the area east of seaside avenue and camp ellis avenue and areas

and analysis involves the preparation and review of a detailed analysis of the existing conditions on the site the opportunities and constraints these conditions create for the use and development of the site and the factors that must be addressed in the development of the master plan for the master planned development the master plan phase involves the preparation and review of a conceptual master plan for the overall master planned development and the development standards that will apply to individual buildings subdivisions or phases of the development based upon the results of the site inventory and analysis approval of the master plan and development standards must occur before any application is submitted for site plan review or subdivision approval b the site plan or subdivision review phase involves the preparation and review of the detailed development plans for individual buildings subdivisions or phases of the development in accordance with the citys site plan review provisions andor subdivision in addition to conforming to the requirements of those chapters and the other zoning requirements a master planned development must demonstrate that it is consistent with the approved master plan and its development standards 2 in addition a developer or property owner considering a master planned development may go conceptual review as set forth in this review is optional the conceptual review is intended to be informational and the results of this review are not binding on the applicant or on the planning board b where permitted master planned developments are permitted only in those zones where they are expressly allowed by the standards of the zone c area included in a master planned development 1 the intention of these requirements is that a master planned development includes a substantial area that will allow for the master planning of a significant development activity if a parcel is less than 10 acres the entire area of the parcel must be included in the master planned development unless the planning board determines otherwise based upon the unique characteristics of the parcel or existing development on the parcel for lots with 10 acres or more the planning board may permit a portion of the parcel to be treated as a master planned development or the parcel to be treated as more than one master planned development if it finds that such treatment will be consistent with the provisions of this section and will result in a coordinated development approach for the entire holding if the planning board allows a master planned  230416 seasonal property rental  230416  development that is less than the entire parcel the master planned development must include at least five acres 2 if the planning board allows a master planned development to include less than the entire parcel or if it permits multiple master planned developments on a parcel the site inventory and analysis the conceptual site plan and preliminary infrastructure plan submitted for the initial master planned development must cover the entire area of the parcel unless the planning board determines that the areas of the parcel not included are unlikely to be developed in the future due to site constraints or legal restrictions on development such as easements the materials submitted for the entire site must allow the planning board to evaluate the overall utilization of the entire parcel and how the master planned development under consideration fits into the overall development plan d conceptual review 1 the purpose of the conceptual review is to allow the property owner or developer to discuss the preliminary concepts for the master planned development with the planning staff and planning board as such the review is intended to be informal and educational in nature the planning boards feedback on the preliminary concepts is nonbinding 2 if an applicant wants to go conceptual review process the applicant shall provide 12 copies of the following information to the planning staff a a map showing the location of the property under discussion b evidence of right title or interest in the property such as a deed lease option or purchase and sale agreement c a preliminary site analysis based on available information identifying the possible opportunities and constraints that the natural and built environments create for the use and development of the site this analysis should tentatively identify the portions of the site anticipated to be suitable for development as well as areas that are potentially unbuildable or suitable as open space or conservation areas d a narrative and accompanying sketches describing the potential development concept and how the development concept is consistent with the appropriate approval criteria e an indication of any submission requirements for which the applicant may be interested in requesting waivers 3 the planning board shall review the materials at a meeting of the planning board all property owners that are entitled to notice  230416 saco city code  230416  under 3 will be notified of the meeting the result of the planning board review will be to provide the applicant with guidance as to whether the potential development is consistent with the general intent of the master planned development provisions issues or questions that will need to be addressed in subsequent submissions and on the suitability of possible waivers of the submission requirements of e site inventory and analysis and master plan phase this phase consists of the preparation of a site inventory and analysis together with development of a master plan for the development based on the site analysis this section lays out the requirements for the site inventory and analysis and the master plan 1 site inventory and analysis a the site inventory and analysis is intended to provide the applicant planning board staff boards and utility districts and public with a

specific issues or questions in the site plan review process  230416 saco city code  230416  when additional information is available andor detailed design or engineering has been completed 1 the master plan must demonstrate that the development will result in the creation of highquality mixeduse neighborhood that is consistent with the vision for the planned mixed use development area set out in the citys 2011 update of the comprehensive plan 2 the overall development concept must provide for a mix of residential and nonresidential uses and must assure that both components of the neighborhood will be developed in a timely manner 3 the master plan must result in the creation of a mixeduse neighborhood in which residential and nonresidential uses are integrated both with designated development areas and within individual buildings a plan that proposes that part of the development area be exclusively residential while the balance of the development area is exclusively nonresidential is not consistent with this standard while some development areas may be devoted exclusively to one type of use the objective is that there be a mix of uses throughout the neighborhood 4 the residential uses proposed as part of the master plan should include a mix of housing types 5 the nonresidential uses proposed as part of the master plan must be compatible with and integrated into the overall neighborhood development provisions must be included in the master plan to minimize and mitigate any potential conflicts between residential and nonresidential uses large parking lots should be avoided and parking provided in smaller welllandscaped lots 6 if retail uses are proposed as part of the master plan these uses should be intended to either primarily serve residents and workers in the neighborhood or adjacent neighborhoods or offer goods and services that complement goods and services offered by the downtown business community or in other commercial districts the master plan must demonstrate how this standard will be met 7 the overall layout of the development including the street system must result in a neighborhood in which all or most buildings and other centers of activity are internally focused rather than focused on route 1 vehicle access to individual buildings or lots should be primarily from the internal street network the creation of curb cuts on route 1 to serve individual lots or buildings should be avoided 8 the proposed street system serving the development should create an interconnected network that allows vehicles to move about the neighborhood without having to use existing arterials or collectors the street network within the development should also be  230416 seasonal property rental  230416  interconnected and deadend streets should be avoided the internal street network should be connected to the existing street network at appropriate locations and should provide access to all adjacent arterials and collectors if feasible 9 the overall character of the development should be urban rather than suburban most buildings should be located close to the street and parking lots should be located to the side or rear of most buildings although provision for limited parking between a building and the street may be appropriate for convenience retail and service uses major buildings should be more than one story and should include a mix of uses the urban design standards of  230729 should guide the character of the neighborhood 10 the design of streets within the neighborhood should be urban in character with provisions for sidewalks or other pedestrianways street trees and lighting the master plan must demonstrate how this requirement will be met 11 the neighborhood must be pedestrianfriendly and provide a high level of pedestrian and bicycle facilities the master plan should provide for the creation of pedestrian and bicycle networks that allow people to move within the neighborhood the neighborhoods pedestrian and bicycle networks should connect to the citys existing facilities and to the eastern trail where feasible 12 the neighborhood must include a network of parks recreation areas and conservation landopen space at a minimum at least 15% of the total area of the development and at least 5% of the developable area of the master planned development must be set aside for these purposes the location and type of land should be based on the site inventory and analysis and should create an interconnected green network where feasible and consistent with the site analysis 13 the master plan should address opportunities for alternative transportation such as mass transit provisions for bus stops or other facilities should be incorporated into the master plan if appropriate a plan that proposes reducing the amount of parking provided in exchange for support for transit service is appropriate and may be approved by the planning board as part of the master plan h additional standards of approval for a master plan for a master planned development in the mu4 district in addition to the general standards of approval set out in 5 the planning board shall approve a master plan for a master planned development in the mu4 district only if it finds that the master plan conforms to all of the following additional standards the planning board may condition its approval of the master plan on the applicant addressing specific issues or questions  230416 saco city code  230416  in the site plan review process when additional information is available andor detailed design or engineering has been completed 1 the master plan assures that areas that are identified in the site inventory and analysis as being unsuitable or having significant limitations for development or use are preserved as open space to the extent practical that areas that are identified as having potential conservation or open space value have been considered for inclusion in any open space and that development in these areas is minimized to the extent practical 2 the master plan assures that the treatment of areas along the perimeter of the mu4 district that are adjacent to existing residential uses are done in a manner that minimizes any negative impacts on the adjacent residential uses including visual intrusion exterior lighting noise traffic or other external factors 3 the master plan assures that the treatment of areas adjacent to existing public streets creates an attractive urban streetscape that is compatible with the pattern of the adjacent neighborhood and results in the transition of the development into the adjacent neighborhood taking into consideration the scale and massing of any buildings or structures in this area the orientation of buildings to the street if they are located within 100 feet of the street the location of parking vehicular drives and service areas including limitations on parking between buildings and existing streets and any
