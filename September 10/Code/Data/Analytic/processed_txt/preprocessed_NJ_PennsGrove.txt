of their citizenry b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the borough of penns grove are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored cause damage in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly floodcontrol projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions   2478 penns grove code  2521   2522 definitions 5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains

flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  4 controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 preventing

grove finds that it is in the public interest to require the separation of designated waste materials from trash garbage and other waste products which are collected by the borough and are disposed of in a solid waste landfill facility obvious environmental and cost benefits will be derived from practicing waste minimization and its importance as part of a comprehensive solid waste management plan cannot be overestimated hence the borough encourages all residents along with commercial and institutional solid waste generators to reduce waste at the source to reuse materials when practical and to recycle waste when possible b the borough also recognizes its obligation to establish a mandatory recycling program under the provisions of pl 198 c 102 as amended34 in order to fulfill its obligations under state statute to conserve recyclable materials for sale and reuse to the public benefit and to reduce the amount of solid waste to be disposed of in a sanitary landfill and thus to
