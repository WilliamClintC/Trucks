provision for buffer areas between incompatible uses to minimize the harmful impacts of noise dust odors artificial light intrusion and other objectionable impacts created as a result of incompatible abutting uses  to promote a harmonious interface between differing land uses with the intent of protecting and preserving the best visual appearance character and economic value of neighboring properties  to set forth guidelines for various categories of landscape screening and buffer areas in conjunction with established yard setbacks to soften the transition for one use of lesser intensity to that of another of higher intensity  and more importantly to promote efficient land development site planning with attention to landscape screening and buffering in an effort to preserve and promote the health safety and general welfare of the public within the city applicability this ordinance provides within the district regulations a requirement describing certain landscaping standards to apply where districts abut various other districts as specified where the ordinance specifies a certain landscaping standard that ordinance shall be met by installation and maintenance of plant and other material in accordance with the virginia beach landscape screening and buffering specifications and standards categories of landscape screening types a for purposes of this section there shall be eight 8 categories of screening to be employed as specified in district regulations to satisfy the screening and buffering requirements of proposed uses of higher intensity to those existing of lower intensity b existing screening materials when a lot is to be developed such that screening is required and where that lot abuts an existing hedge wall or other durable landscape barrier on an abutting property the existing structure or hedge may be used to satisfy the screening requirements of this section provided that the existing structure meets the minimum standards set forth herein and protection against vehicular encroachment is provided however the burden to provide the necessary screening remains with the use to be screened and is a continuing obligation which runs with the land so long as the original relationship exists provisions of acceptable alternatives amy person who may be required to install screening in conjunction with land development and who believes that by virtue of special consideration of site design topography unique relationships to other properties or existing natural vegetation the application of the specific standards are ineffective in fulfilling the requirements of this section may submit to the planning director a specific plan for development showing how the purposes of this section may be met by measures other than those listed above the planning director after consulting with appropriate city officials may approve modifications to established standards so long as the effect and intent of the established standards are achieved  maintenance responsibilities the owner and tenant if any of any property where screening is required shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all screening materials so as to present a healthy neat and orderly appearance and be kept free from litter and debris shrubs or trees planted as a part of any required screening which subsequently dies shall be replaced in accordance with the minimum standards of this section all screening and landscape areas shall be protected from encroachment by motor vehicles or pedestrians which could damage vegetation or reduce the effectiveness of the screening h  optional street setbacks in strategic growth areas purpose a the purpose of this is to establish interim regulations to allow the development of highquality urbanstyle development in the citys strategic growth areas sgas pending the adoption of zoning regulations that provide specific direction regarding the form of development in each such sga  findings the city council finds that a in the 2003 comprehensive plan the city established strategic growth areas as areas designed to absorb most of the citys future growth both residential and nonresidential sgas were planned to contain uses that are more intensive than in most other areas of the city but are integrated into compact yet compatible mixes of uses including office retail service hotel and where appropriate residential uses the 2003 plan also set forth five common planning principles applicable to all sgas 1 efficient use of land resources  2 full use of urban services  3 compatible mix of uses  4 a range of transportation opportunities  and 5 detailed humanscale design b the 2009 comprehensive plan retained the same strategy and guiding principles as are set forth hereinabove that strategy has been refined and expanded by means of separate implementation plans that were specific to each of the citys sgas and were adopted only after an extensive public outreach program was employed in each instance the plans for all of those sgas retain the five 5 basic planning principles set forth in subsection a in addition the 2009 plan noted that the city has identified sgas as 1 providing opportunities for continued physical and economic growth  2 helping to prevent urban sprawl  3 protecting our established residential neighborhoods and rural areas from incompatible development due to growth pressures  4 maximizing infrastructure efficiency  and 5 creating unique and exciting urban destinations c traditional suburbanstyle development typically lacks significant connectivity to mass transit systems and bicycle or pedestrianoriented features instead depending almost exclusively upon automobile traffic such dependence upon the automobile results in large expanses of asphalt or other impervious parking surfaces that are rarely if ever fully utilized and has significant undesirable effects including among others 1 inefficient use of land  2 greater adverse environmental impacts notwithstanding compliance with applicable regulations than verticallyoriented mixeduse development  3 incompatibility both functional and architectural with adjacent communities  4 increased traffic congestion  and 5 a lack of uniqueness and sense of place differentiating virginia beach from other cities d while the citys vision for the sgas is welldeveloped in the comprehensive plan and in the implementation plans for the sgas not all of the strategic growth areas contain updated development standards implementing the city councils vision among the development standards that contribute to the achievement of the urban form contemplated by the comprehensive plan are lesser setbacks from streets as such setbacks activate the street frontage by locating building facades close to the street thereby providing a walkable pedestrianoriented streetscape however the setback regulations currently applicable to the various zoning districts located within the remaining sgas generally require large street setbacks and as a result have the effect of preventing byright development that is consistent with the goals and objectives of the sgas e in light of the foregoing considerations it is necessary advisable and in the public interest for the city council to adopt optional setback regulations in order to encourage and promote development that conforms to and advances the citys vision for the sgas such regulations should remain in effect until such time as individual codes and other zoning tools that are specific to each of the sgas and responsive to the city councils vision can be developed and adopted by the city council after having received the benefit of extensive public comment  applicability the provisions of this shall apply to property in apartment hotel office business and industrial districts located within a strategic growth area  optional byright minimum front and front side setbacks a notwithstanding any contrary provision of the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located property that is subject to the provisions of section 282 may optionally be developed in accordance with the

regulations title this article shall be known as the air installations compatible use zones aicuz overlay the city of virginia beach  purpose and intent the purpose of this article is to regulate in a manner consistent with the rights of individual property owners and the requirements of military operations at naval air station nas oceana development of uses and structures that are incompatible with military operations  to sustain the economic health of the city and hampton roads region  to protect and preserve the public health safety and welfare from the adverse impacts associated with high levels of noise from flight operations at nas oceana and the potential for aircraft accidents associated with proximity to airport operations  and to maintain the overall quality of life of those who live work and recreate in the city of virginia beach  findings the city council hereby finds that a naval air station nas oceana was first established as an auxiliary airfield in 1943 and was designated as a major navy jet air base in the 1950s it is now one of the largest navy air bases in the country and is the master jet base for the navys atlantic fleet nas oceana is a vital component in the architecture of the defense departments joint service method of operational planning and execution and in the newlyemerging interagency approach to meeting homeland defense requirements  b nas oceana is the single largest employer in the city of virginia beach in 200 it had a gross annual payroll of over seven hundred fifty million dollars $75000000000 and spent another four hundred million dollars $40000000000 for goods and services in that year over twelve thousand 12000 personnel comprised of nearly nine thousand eight hundred 9800 military and over two thousand five hundred 2500 civilian employees were employed there most of those employees live within the community infusing additional benefits into the local economy primarily spousal employment salaries when considering the personal impact of the military in the community the economic benefit exceeds one billion dollars $100000000000 annually  c there are more than thirty thousand 30000 acres of land in areas within the 7075 db dnl or >75 db dnl noise zones and approximately 16500 acres of land within the 6570 db dnl noise zone approximately four thousand three hundred 4300 acres of this land is encumbered by easements or restrictive covenants that limit the uses of the land to those that are not incompatible with flight operations arising out of nas oceana  d since the installations inception development of a type deemed incompatible under the navys aicuz program has occurred such that the navy has voluntarily modified flight arrival and departure procedures thereby resulting in flight procedures and training that do not replicate actual aircraft carrier operating procedures e in august 200 the base realignment and closure brac commission added to the list of installations to be closed or realigned the recommendation to realign nas oceana by relocating the atlantic fleets east coast master jet base to cecil field in jacksonville florida if among other things the cities of virginia beach and chesapeake fail to enact and enforce legislation to prevent further encroachment of nas oceana by the end of march 2006 by adopting zoning ordinances that require the governing bodies to follow air installations compatibility use zone aicuz guidelines in deciding discretionary development applications for property in noise level 70 db day night average noise level dnl or greater  f the closure or realignment of nas oceana would have serious adverse economic consequences to the city and the region  and g in 2004 and 200 the city of virginia beach along with the cities of norfolk and chesapeake joined with the navy and the hampton roads planning district commission to craft a regional joint land use study jlus among the recommendations of the jlus was that the city adopt an ordinance applicable in all noise zones greater than 65 db dnl to help prevent encroachment at nas oceana the jlus was accepted by resolution of the city council in may of 2005 and the city council directed that appropriate ordinances implementing the recommendations of the jlus be brought forward for its consideration    applicability a area of applicability the provisions of this apply to

yard spacing and maximum lot coverage for residential dwellings and commercial structures are set forth in of this ordinance  article 21  workforce housing purpose and intent the purpose and intent of this article is to encourage the development of highquality housing that is affordable by households with annual incomes falling within a prescribed range for prospective purchasers and prospective renters of workforce housing respectively set forth in the workforce housing provisions of chapter 16 of the city who live or work in virginia beach because such households generally although not uniformly consist of one 1 or two 2 working members such housing is termed workforce housing in order to accomplish that goal this article establishes incentives for the construction of workforce housing in areas of the city including strategic growth areas in which the comprehensive plan recognizes increased density to be appropriate equally importantly this article also ensures that workforce housing will be welldesigned of high quality and wellintegrated into the overall development of which it is a component    findings the city council hereby finds that a housing prices have risen much faster than incomes during the past few years thereby eliminating for many people the option of purchasing a home and for others the option of renting without causing an undue financial burden  b the most effective approach to preserving the quality of the citys housing and neighborhoods is to maintain and improve upon their diversity this diversity includes the type value and design of housing and neighborhoods which in turn helps the city meet its goals for a quality physical environment family and youth opportunities and economic vitality in addition people from a variety of cultures backgrounds ages races and capabilities will have greater opportunities to find and retain safe decent and affordable housing  c the planning and creation of mixedincome and mixeduse developments will advance the citys goal of providing diverse highquality and affordable housing in desirable neighborhoods allowing a greater mix of incomes within neighborhoods increases the affordability of housing and reduces the isolation of income groups further mixeduse developments are beneficial in the long run because they broaden housing opportunities increase residents access to nearby employment and provide a better land use arrangement to accommodate alternative costeffective transportation systems d without an adequate supply of workforce housing employees of local businesses would be forced to live in places that are distant from the workplace thereby causing financial and social stress upon the families of such employees in addition an inadequate supply of workforce housing would discourage prospective businesses from locating in virginia beach  and e workforce housing is not housing of inferior quality or design nor will it adversely affect the value of homes in the vicinity as required by the provisions of this article the exterior of workforce housing units will be essentially indistinguishable from nonworkforce housing units of the same housing type and the overall quality of construction of the interior of workforce housing units will be comparable to that of nonworkforce housing units workforce housing units within mixeduse developments will be subject to applicable design standards set forth in the comprehensive plan in addition workforce housing units will be integrated into the residential component of a mixeduse development rather than being located in discrete areas within that component  definitions as used in this article the following terms shall be defined as follows a affordable housing is considered affordable if no more than approximately thirty 30 percent of the gross household income of the purchaser or renter is spent on direct housing costs as set forth in article viii of chapter 16 of the city buyers such costs include mortgage principal interest taxes homeowners insurance mandatory homeowners association dues and condominium fees but do not include utilities or other related housing costs for renters such costs include rent payments and an allowance for tenantpaid utilities other than cable television and telephone service but do not include other related housing costs b affordability

income ami the area median income for the virginia beachnorfolknewport news virginia metropolitan statistical area msa published annually by the us department of housing and urban development hud and adjusted for household size d bonus density an increase in the maximum allowable dwelling unit density on a property attributable to the provision of workforce housing on that property e eligible buyer a person whose workforce housing application has been approved and who meets the home ownership requirements of the workforce housing program these requirements center on gross annual income financial assets and location where the prospective buyer works and lives f eligible renter a person whose workforce housing application has been approved and who meets the rental requirements of the workforce housing program these requirements center on gross annual income financial assets and location where the prospective renter works and lives g strategic growth area sga areas of the city that are designated in the comprehensive plan to absorb most of citys future growth both residential and nonresidential these areas which are planned for more intensive uses than most other areas of the city are characterized by the integration not separation of diverse but compatible uses including where appropriate residential uses h workforce housing wfh housing that is generally affordable to

regulations applicable to development within the central business core district such district shall be designated on the official zoning map as cbc b in the event of a conflict between the provisions of this any other provision of the city zoning the provisions of this apply unless expressly otherwise provided c the provisions of this be severable such that in the event one 1 or more of the provisions of this be adjudged to be invalid or unenforceable the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired by such adjudication  purpose a the purpose of this to establish regulations implementing the vision of the city council for the central business districtcore area portion of the pembroke strategic growth area as expressed in the pembroke strategic growth area implementation plan sga plan adopted on  such regulations are intended to foster the continued development of a central urban core with a vertical mix of urban uses mobility and transit alternatives urban gathering places environmental and neighborhood protection green buildings and infrastructure opportunities providing a variety of civic commercial artistic and ethnically diverse areas  findings the city council finds that a in the 2003 comprehensive plan the city established strategic growth areas sgas including the pembroke sga as areas designed to absorb most of the citys anticipated future growth both residential and nonresidential the sgas were planned to contain uses that are more intensive than in most other areas of the city but are integrated into compact yet compatible mixes of uses including office retail service hotel and where appropriate residential uses the 2003 comprehensive plan also set forth five common planning principles applicable to all sgas 1 efficient use of land resources  2 full use of urban services  3 a compatible mix of uses  4 a range of transportation opportunities  and 5 detailed humanscale design b the 2003 comprehensive plan also set forth guidance concerning the implementation of the vision embodied in the various sgas it stated of equal importance will be how the sgas develop in regard to the form that they take the sgas are intended to be urban in form with a mixture of uses commonly found in urban settings the areas however that are designated as sgas are largely either undeveloped or developed in the same suburban pattern found throughout the city how we reshape these undeveloped and suburban areas will be critical if we are to create memorable urban places where people desire to live work play and learn as the various implementation plans are developed for the sgas we must develop design guidelines and new zoning tools such as form based codes that provide specific direction to those who own property in the sgas regarding what the form of those places will be if the form of the sgas does not match our vision for the sgas we will have lost much this plan therefore provides fundamental guidance regarding the proper form of urban places and the principles of design that can be used as we move forward to create an active and vibrant urban corridor from newtown to the oceanfront c the 2009 comprehensive plan retained the strategy and guiding principles set forth hereinabove that strategy has been refined and expanded by means of separate plans that were specific to each of the eight sgas within the city and that were adopted only after an extensive public participation in each instance the plans for all of those sgas retain the five basic planning principles set forth in subsection a in addition the 2009 plan noted that the city has identified sgas as 1 providing opportunities for continued physical and economic growth  2 helping to prevent urban sprawl  3 protecting our established residential neighborhoods and rural areas from incompatible development due to growth pressures  4 maximizing infrastructure efficiency  and 5 creating unique and exciting urban destinations d traditional suburbanstyle development typically lacks significant connectivity to mass transit systems and bicycle or pedestrianoriented features instead depending almost exclusively upon automobile traffic such dependence upon the automobile results in large expanses of asphalt or other impervious parking surfaces that are rarely if ever fully utilized and has significant undesirable impacts including among others 1 inefficient use of land  2 greater adverse impacts on air and water quality notwithstanding compliance with applicable regulations than

the intent of the sign regulations set forth in this section is to 1 encourage signage that enhances the overall aesthetics of the central business core district  2 ensure that the public benefits derived from past and future expenditures of public funds for the infrastructure improvements and beautification of the streets and public spaces are protected by preventing visual clutter caused by excessive or poorly placed signage  3 encourage signage that is reflective of the aesthetics and character of its location and compatible with and integrated into the buildings architectural design and with other signs on the property  4 provide incentives for highquality signage by increasing signage allowances for signs that conform to the central business core district design guidelines  and 5 encourage creativity by providing flexibility to utilize signage not only as a means of identifying a business establishment but as a decorative feature to enhance the appearance of a building as well b findings the city council finds that 1 signs have a strong visual impact on the character and quality of a community they are an integral part of the cityscape and as such can enhance or detract from the citys image and character as a prominent part of the cityscape they can attract or repel the viewer and affect the safety of vehicular traffic and their suitability helps to define the way in which a community is perceived because the city of virginia beach relies on the attractiveness of the town center area to attract tourists and commerce aesthetic considerations are directly related to economic value apart from economic considerations however there are intangible benefits for a community in which signage is orderly and attractive  2 the citys current sign regulations address characteristics such as the size and number of signs but generally do not address other characteristics such as design that are equally important in promoting an attractive urban downtown area 3 design standards for signage are used in many other localities that are known for their attractiveness and appeal to residents and visitors alike and have been wellaccepted by both businesses and the general public as a means of enhancing the overall appearance and prosperity of the community  and 4 providing incentives for businesses to display signage that conforms to voluntary design guidelines is an appropriate means of encouraging those businesses to use welldesigned highly attractive signs that harmonize with the buildings on which they are displayed the surrounding neighborhood and other signage in the area c establishment of special sign district the central business core district is hereby declared a special sign district in which the provisions of this

wetlands zoning ordinance app a 400 et seq  coastal primary sand dune zoning ordinance app a  1600 et seq title this ordinance shall be known as the southern rivers watershed management the city of virginia beach  findings of fact a the watersheds of the north landing river the northwest river the small coastal south watershed and back bay collectively referred to herein as the southern rivers watershed of the city and the waterways they contain constitute a unique and sensitive environment inclusive of coastal primary sand dunes tidal wetlands nontidal wetlands and sensitive soils b extensive floodplains and marsh fringes bordering the waterways within the southern rivers watershed provide a unique and valuable habitat lands adjacent to waterways have an intrinsic water quality value due to the ecological and biological processes they perform or which occur within them c much of the land area comprising the southern rivers watershed currently supports forestal agricultural recreational and conservation activities any future development must be undertaken in a manner which encourages harmony among development agriculture recreation and conservation d the primary topographic feature characterizing the southern rivers watershed is the flatness of the lands surrounding back bay the north landing river the northwest river and the small coastal south watershed and their respective tributaries the lack of topographic relief is a unique characteristic of the southern river watershed which must be considered when undertaking development and agricultural activities within the watersheds e submerged aquatic vegetation certain migratory waterfowl and finfish populations have seriously declined within the back bay watershed proper management of existing wetland habitats and the reestablishment of aquatic vegetation can improve habitat conditions for both migratory waterfowl and aquatic life f back bay is generally shallow with a few narrow channels winddriven tides often inundate the lower floodplains wind tides coupled with storm events influence the physical conditions of the bay including salinity suspended solids and nutrient levels g the increase of nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of receiving waters adversely affecting plant and animal communities h landdisturbing activities resulting in the alteration of natural topography and removal of vegetation tends to increase erosion i vegetated areas adjoining waterways and wetlands protect those resources by reducing the generation and transport of sediment j indigenous ground cover especially forested floor area is effective in holding soil in place thereby preventing site erosion and in filtering stormwater runoff by minimizing impervious cover and land disturbance rainwater infiltration is enhanced and stormwater runoff reduced k unstable ditch and canal banks and eroding marsh areas contribute sediment and nutrients to receiving streams l the major hydraulic pathways by which pollutants generated by agricultural activities enter receiving streams are surface runoff and groundwater discharge the major pollutants are sediment and nutrients m for agriculture tillage and cropping systems nutrients animal waste management irrigation drainage pest management and other factors must be considered in conjunction with each other n the implementation and assessment of agricultural best management practices bmps must be performed within the framework of the entire farming system o a realistic program for the implementation of agricultural bmps cannot be developed in the absence of a holistic assessment of bmp effectiveness and impacts including environmental economic social and other motivational factors p the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes program generally requires a reduction of pollutant loads in stormwater runoff to the maximum extent practicable q periodic water quality monitoring has indicated elevated levels of fecal coliform bacteria in several canals connected to back bay adjacent to the sandbridge community these canals have in the past been classified class i health hazards in violation of health department standards for primary contact waters r the north landing river from the north carolina line to the bridge at route 165 the pocaty river from its junction with the north landing river to the blackwater road bridge west neck creek from the junction with the north landing river to indian river road bridge and blackwater creek from the junction with the north landing river to the confluence approximately 42 miles of an unnamed tributary approximately 175 miles more or less west of blackwater road have been designated by the virginia general assembly as components of the virginia scenic rivers system the wetlands of the north landing river northwest river and back bay support high concentrations of natural heritage resources and migratory waterfowl making this area a national conservation priority s in 199 the united states fish and wildlife service completed an environmental assessment and land protection plan that established an acquisition boundary within which lands that are nationally important for wildlife could be purchased for inclusion in the national wildlife refuge system when acquired these environmentally sensitive lands would be managed as part of the back bay national wildlife refuge t there is not an absolute relationship between soil type and topographic elevation some poorly drained soils such as acredale may occur both at low elevations adjacent to back bay and at higher elevations in the interior portions of the city these hydric soils of different elevations are not equally suitable for development conversely there are a few areas of welldrained soils that occur at relatively low elevations u much of the area within the southern rivers watershed lies within natural areas identified in the virginia beach natural areas inventory and contains significant natural heritage resources    objectives this ordinance is intended to protect enhance and restore the quality of waters within the southern rivers watershed of the city in order to protect maintain and enhance both the immediate and the longterm health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city of virginia beach this ordinance has the following objectives a to encourage productive and enjoyable harmony among agricultural recreational developmental and conservation interests and the natural resources of the city  b to enhance restore and protect the chemical physical and biological integrity of waters within the southern rivers watershed  c to encourage the construction of drainage systems which maintain or functionally approximate existing natural systems and to prevent the alteration of existing drainage systems where such activities may adversely affect water quality or natural heritage resources  d to encourage the protection of watercourses and the use of them in ways which do not impair their beneficial functioning  e to minimize or reduce the transport of pollutants to the waters of the southern rivers watershed  f to protect groundwater  g to minimize or reduce erosion and sedimentation  h to prevent damage to wetlands and criticaledge habitat  i to prevent damage from flooding while recognizing that natural fluctuations in water levels are beneficial  j to protect restore and maintain plant and animal including fish communities in the southern rivers watershed  k to improve drainage systems
