regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen building fifteen  fire prevention s note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances  the comparative is included to show the disposition of every ordinance included in the codified ordinances it indicates whether a given ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more sections cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a

some information redacted the law director shall be consulted passed 32105 10907 records not information the law of ohio requires public records not public information to be released it does not require the creation of records that do not exist nor the interpretation of information in public records village employees are directed to refrain from these activities and direct the inquirers for information rather than documents to appropriate official eg administrative director finance director law director police chief or mayor passed 32105 10908 goal of policy the village recognizes that the records it possesses belong to the public not to village officials however village officials have an obligation to preserve these records in an orderly manner to avoid making copies of records not requested which is a waste of taxpayers money and not to release any record that is either not a public record or contains information which is not public information unless that information has been redacted from the record passed 32105 10909 reasonable time while the term reasonable time is not subject to precise definition in the abstract it is used in two senses in the law records must be made available for inspection at all reasonable times during regular business hours a request to inspect records just before the end of regular business hours need not be honored if it would require the employee to work overtime the applicant should be directed to return during business hours copies are also to be provided within a reasonable time while an exact time limit cannot be set the volume of the request as well as other duties of the employee are factors to be considered generally requests should be processed within three workdays but voluminous record requests may take longer effort should be made to fill requests as soon as possible particularly if the request is for only a few pages but reasonable time does not mean immediately compliance with records requests is not given by law priority over other duties of the employee passed 32105 10910 conclusion the purpose of this policy is to allow the village to fully comply with ohio rc 14943 in a manner that will promote the availability of public records and maintain the efficiency and economy of village administrative operations passed 32105 chapter 111 identity theft policy 11101background 11102purpose 11103scope

chapter pursuant to of the ohio revised the lexington village council hereinafter council makes the following statement of intent and findings 1 adult entertainment establishments require special supervision from the public safety agencies of the village of lexington in order to protect and preserve the health safety morals and welfare of the patrons and employees of the businesses as well as the citizens of the village of lexington 2 council finds that adult entertainment establishments are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature 3 the concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of council that demands reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by council in the specified manner and expanded authority for reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by local governments in order to protect the health and wellbeing of the citizens 4 minimal regulations enacted by council are a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation 5 there is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment establishments because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them cause increased crime particularly in the overnight hours and downgrade property values 6 council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects by regulating adult entertainment establishments in the specified manner and by minimizing and controlling these adverse effects council seeks to protect the health safety and welfare of the citizenry  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of urban blight 7 council has determined that current local zoning and other locational criteria do not adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of the people of the village of lexington and that expanded regulation of adult entertainment establishments is necessary 8 it is not the intent of council in enacting this act to suppress or authorize the suppression of any speech activities protected by the first amendment but to enact contentneutral statutes that address the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments 9 it is not the intent of council to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material and council recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages state law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against any such illegal activities in this state bit is the intent of council in enacting this chapter to regulate in the specified manner adult entertainment establishments in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the village of lexington and establish reasonable regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments within the village of lexington the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent of council in enacting this chapter to restrict or deny or authorize the restriction or denial of access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny or authorize the denial of access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult entertainment and adult materials to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of council in enacting this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of obscene material c based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on communities presented in

council hereinafter council makes the following statement of intent and findings 1 adult entertainment establishments require special supervision from the public safety agencies of the village of lexington in order to protect and preserve the health safety morals and welfare of the patrons and employees of the businesses as well as the citizens of the village of lexington 2 council finds that adult entertainment establishments are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature 3 the concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of council that demands reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by council in the specified manner and expanded authority for reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by local governments in order to protect the health and wellbeing of the citizens 4 minimal regulations enacted by council are a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation 5 there is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment establishments because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them cause increased crime particularly in the overnight hours and downgrade property values 6 council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects by regulating adult entertainment establishments in the specified manner and by minimizing and controlling these adverse effects council seeks to protect the health safety and welfare of the citizenry  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of urban blight 7 council has determined that current local zoning and other locational criteria do not adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of the people of the village of lexington and that expanded regulation of adult entertainment establishments is necessary 8 it is not the intent of council in enacting this act to suppress or authorize the suppression of any speech activities protected by the first amendment but to enact contentneutral statutes that address the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments 9 it is not the intent of council to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material and council recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages state law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against any such illegal activities in this state b it is the intent of council in enacting this chapter to regulate in the specified manner adult entertainment establishments in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the village of lexington and establish reasonable regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments within the village of lexington the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent of council in enacting this chapter to restrict or deny or authorize the restriction or denial of access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny or authorize the denial of access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult entertainment and adult materials to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of council in enacting this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of obscene material cbased on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on communities presented in hearings and in reports made available to the legislature and subsequently adopted by the

councils independent review of the same council finds 1 adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments 2 certain employees of adult entertainment establishments as defined in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at adult entertainment establishments especially those that provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows the couch dances or lap dances that frequently occur in adult entertainment establishments featuring live nude or seminude dancers constitute or may constitute the offense of engaging in prostitution under of the revised 4 offering and providing private or semiprivate booths or cubicles encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity within the premises of those adult entertainment establishments 6 numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hiv aids genital herpes hepatitis salmonella campylobacter and shigella infections chlamydial myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections trichomoniasis and chancroid 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states 600 in 198 2200 in 198 4600 in 198 8555 in 198 and 253448  8 a total of 10255 aids cases had been reported in ohio as of january 1999 ohio has required hiv case reporting since 199 and the reported information shows 7969 people living with hiv 4213 and aids 3756 in the state 9 since 1981 and to the present there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the hiv antibody test in ohio 10 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen 33613 cases were reported in 198 and 45200 cases were reported  11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 12 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse and exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 the findings noted in subsections c1 to 14 hereof raise substantial governmental concerns 16 adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics that require or mandate subject them to reasonable government regulation in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 17

performance standards for stormwater management drainage control and sediment control aintroduction this section provides performance standards that apply to all earth disturbing activities subject to these regulations an engineered plan must also be submitted pursuant to e if earthdisturbing activities will disturb soil on one or more acres of land on a single lot or tract or on less than one acre that is part of a larger common plan of development or sale eg a subdivision if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb at least one acre some projects whether or not required to submit engineered plans must comply with the post construction standards in enter into an inspection and maintenance agreement where necessary to control stormwater after completion of construction bapplicability 1the performance standards in this section apply to all developments that have any of the following characteristics athe development will involve at least 3000 square feet of earth disturbing activities  bthe development is part of a larger common plan that will involve at least 3000 square feet of earthdisturbing activities such as a subdivision or subdivided land  cthe development will 1create at least 2000 square feet of impervious surface 2add impervious surface to a development already possessing at least 2000 square feet of impervious surface or 3add impervious surface that in combination with existing impervious surface creates a total of at least 2000 square feet of impervious surface  dthe proposed development will significantly change the use eg from residential to commercial of a development previously subject to this section  or ethe development will involve earthdisturbing activities within 100 feet of a stream a wetland or special flood hazard area see the richland county floodplain regulations for additional requirements for developments in progress on the effective date of these regulations in which at least the threshold amount of the activities identified in subsection b1 hereof will occur after the effective date the activities occurring after the effective date are subject to the newly promulgated requirements of other activities subject to the previous regulations shall continue to comply with the standards and other requirements of the previous regulations and any permits plans agreements and other obligations established pursuant to the previous regulations eg if 5000 square feet of a 20000 square foot development are disturbed before the effective date that 5000 square feet would be subject to the previous regulations while the remainder would be subject to the new regulations 2where a performance standard in this section is expressly limited to earth disturbing activities of a specific acreage that performance standard applies only to earthdisturbing activities of that size cinitiation of work 1at least 30 days prior to initiating earthdisturbing activities for which swmsc engineered plans are not required under the ownersoperators shall submit to the stormwater manager a permit application by completing an application form provided by the stormwater manager and submitting the information required by the checklist for applications contained in the appendix to these regulations the stormwater manager shall review and act on the approval or disapproval of these permit applications no earthdisturbing activities or construction shall commence prior to the issuance of the permit 2the ownersoperators shall notify the stormwater manager at least 48 hours prior to commencement of earthdisturbing activities for all developments subject to these regulations the ownersoperators shall notify the stormwater manager within 24 hours after project completion dprotection of adjacent properties 1properties adjacent to the site of land disturbance including public lands streets roads and waters shall be protected from sediment deposition this shall be accomplished by preserving a wellvegetated buffer strip around the lower perimeter of the land disturbance by installing perimeter controls such as sediment barriers filters dikes or sediment basins or by a combination of such measures 2prior to conducting earthdisturbing activity that may affect village county or township streets roads or rightsofway outside of the village the ownersoperators shall consult with the village engineer or the affected township official for selecting measures to protect public streets roads and rightsofway from adverse effects caused by sedimentation the ownersoperators shall contact the village engineer or affected township official to arrange a time and place for the consultation evegetative cover 1a permanent vegetative cover shall be established

contaminants treatment must occur and remain on the development site to comply with subsection d hereof 2ownersoperators shall control waste such as discarded building materials chemicals litter and sanitary waste to prevent them from reaching water resources any cleaning or washing of concrete trucks well drilling equipment and related equipment shall be conducted in a manner that shall prevent the wash water and pollutants from reaching water resources 3vegetated filter strips of a correct width and length may be utilized when sheet or overland flow is planned ie when stormwater is not collected whenever a vegetated filter strip alone is ineffective in stopping sediment movement onto adjacent property additional perimeter controls shall be provided 4roof drains shall be a reasonable distance from the property line to avoid flooding and excess discharge of water into road ditches or storm drains splash pads should be used whenever possible hsediment basinstraps when five or more contiguous acres are disturbed in one watershed stormwater runoff from that development area shall pass sediment basin or other suitable sediment trapping facility the sediment basins shall be designed with the equivalent of 67 cubic yard unit per acre or greater storage capacity the stormwater manager may require sediment basins or traps for smaller disturbed areas where deemed necessary the sediment basin requirement may be eliminated if the stormwater manager finds that site conditions do not warrant its construction sediment basins or traps are temporary and shall be removed

qstormwater controldesign methods 1to provide adequate stormwater management for 5000 square feet or larger construction projects the following criteria shall be used to control the increased peak rates and volumes of runoff athe peak discharge rate of runoff from the critical storm event shall be controlled the drainage area and runoff volumes under post development conditions shall not exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff occurring under predevelopment conditions for a oneyear frequency 24hour storm bstorms of less frequent occurrence longer return periods than the critical storm up to and including the 100year storm shall have peak runoff discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size storms under predevelopment conditions calculations of the 1 2 5 10 25 50 and 100year storms shall be considered adequate in designing and developing to meet this standard 2the critical storm for a specific development drainage area is determined as follows ause the natural resources conservation service nrcs tr55 urban hydrology for small watersheds or tr 20 to determine the total volume acrefeet of runoff from a one year 24hour storm occurring on the development drainage area before and after development bafter the volumes have been determined using subsection q2a hereof use table 1 to determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to development and using this percentage select the 24 hour critical storm from the following table  if the percentage of increase in volume of runoff is equal to or the critical storm greater than less than will be  10 1 year 10 20 2 years 20 50 5 years 50 100 10 years 100 250 25 years 250 500 50 years 500  100 years to calculate the critical storm   post developed 1 yr storm q  predeveloped 1 yr storm q  x 100               predeveloped storm q   % change for critical storm table 1 for example if the percent increase between the predevelopment and post development runoff volume for a one  year storm is 35% the critical storm is a 5year storm the peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the oneyear frequency storm under predevelopment conditions in the development drainage area the postdevelopment runoff from all less frequent storms need only be controlled to meet the predevelopment peak discharge rate for each of those same storms 3methods for controlling increases in the rate volume and discharge of stormwater runoff shall include the following athe use of grasslined road ditches rather than paved street gutters where practical and discharging roof water to vegetated areas or grass andor rocklined drainage channels bgrading and construction of terraces or diversions to

from the separate fund shall be approved by village council after consideration of recommendations from the village engineer 4maintenance fund characteristics and calculations athe maintenance funds for the stormwater management facilities shall be derived from an annual assessment levied against all benefiting owners of lots within the subdivision and are accumulated until they are needed to perform maintenance repair or replacement as the facilities age the amount of the maintenance fund is based on the original construction cost of the stormwater management facilities in the subdivision the maintenance fund may never have an unencumbered balance of more than twenty percent 20% of the cost of the original stormwater management facilities as adjusted to current costs once the fund has reached the 20% maximum assessments shall abate until such time as monies are withdrawn from the fund to maintain repair or replace some element of the stormwater management facilities the annual assessment is determined by dividing the maximum maintenance fund balance by six years the entire maintenance fund amount is apportioned to the lots within the subdivision on a fair and equitable formula in order to establish the appropriate amount to be assessed to each property bupon special request the rate of assessment may be partially abated over the initial five year period following subdivision approval this abatement allows developers time to sell individual lots without creating an undue strain on cash flow during the early phases of development beginning with the fifth year of the schedule the assessment shall be collected at the full rate generally when using this assessment schedule where payments in the first five years are partially abated it requires between nine and

that is responsive to the natural and environmental assets and liabilities of a given site the osd provides an alternative zoning category that is intended to encourage imaginative design of development the osd should be a wellintegrated development in terms of major design elements such as roads drainage systems utilities and open space the osd allows greater design flexibility so that natural features may be protected and development concentrated in an innovative and efficient manner 113502 general requirements and osd district designation subsequent to the approval of the village council the designation of osd may be applied to any existing zoning district with the limitations described herein there are two types of osds a osd may be a predominantly residential development and in which case is referred to as a osdrs a osdrs may only be applied to an existing residential district a osd may also be a mixed use development referred to as a osdmx a osdmx may be applied to any existing nonresidential zoning district upon the approval of the final development plan according to this chapter the village zoning map shall be amended to designate the property osdrs or osdmx the tract of land proposed to be developed as a osdmx must be owned leased or controlled by one person or single entity and must be at least five contiguous acres in size the tract of land proposed to be developed as a osdrs must be owned leased or controlled by one person or single entity and must be at least five contiguous acres in size 113503 permitted uses the permitted uses in both the osdrs and

maintenance shall be submitted to the village the village council may require as a condition of final approval any evidence deemed necessary to document that the required common space will remain in its stated condition as long as the development exists including such as legal documents as deed restrictions conservation easements etc bclustering residential density to achieve a clustering of residential density and to provide for the required common open space the lot area requirements for residential land uses may be reduced from the densities required under the districts applying to the property at the time of application by up to twenty percent 20% the lot width and yard requirements for residential lots may be also be reduced as needed to accommodate a variety of structural patterns clustering designs and housing types cresidential dwelling types along with clustering residential density a osdrs may include a mixture of dwelling types including singlefamily detached

form such as rectangle square circle or oval is often preferable to a more elaborate shape or combination of shapes b color colors used should provide sufficient contrast between the message and the background of the sign to assure readability use of no more than four 4 colors including black and white and the background color of the sign is preferable use of bright colors as accents is preferred to their use as dominant colors dark subdued hues are preferred to deemphasize visible support structures like pylons or projecting sign hangers especially if such structures are not ornamental c materials the simple classic beauty of traditional natural materials like wood stone or brick is often preferable if such materials are largely unpainted but rated for exterior exposure so that their natural beauty is exposed d lettering size lettering on signs intended to be read from the street should be no larger than required for readability from the street taking into account the prevalence of vehicular or pedestrian traffic traffic speeds and setback of the sign in most cases letter heights exceeding 15 feet should not be needed for legibility on signs intended to be read by motorists in the street lettering too small to be safely readable at prevailing traffic speeds should be avoided use of no more than two sizes of lettering excluding lettering on changeable copy areas is preferred e fonts type faces or styles use of no more than two type fonts on a sign is preferred the number of fonts used for tenant wall signs in multitenant properties like shopping centers should not be excessive and such signs should share a common base line use of simpler fonts or highly legible versions of stylized fonts is preferable for readability for longer words and messages upper and lower case letters are more readable than all upper case f blank space the sign should contain sufficient blank space around the copy for legibility gsupports poles or other bases for ground signs should be part of the overall sign design they should be ornamental in nature to complement the sign face and of a material such as brick stone wood or ironwork or color and of proportions that enhance the sign face supporting structures for projecting signs should be ornamental hsigns shall contain the minimum amount of information and different elements and the number of letters symbols logos etc should be consistent with the amount of information that can be absorbed by the viewer when approaching the sign avoid visual clutter and improve legibility since motorists have only seconds to absorb and react to a signs message the number of words and symbols should be kept to a minimum on signs designed to be read by motorists in the street symbols can sometimes be used as substitutes for words the sign should not appear busy cluttered or crowded signs intended to be read primarily by pedestrians or motorists in stopped or slowly moving vehicles may have more extensive messages the sign should be oriented around a single dominant symbol word or unified combination of symbols andor words with all other elements clearly subordinate ithere should be no secondary signage or objects attached to a sign face or sign structure which may detract from the primary sign jno flashing or revolving or intermittent light source is permitted and no moving parts either mechanical or wind
