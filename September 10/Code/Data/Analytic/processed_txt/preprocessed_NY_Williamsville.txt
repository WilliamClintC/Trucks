associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition 2 this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species 3 clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitats 4 improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation 5 impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow 6 substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the village 7 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities 8 the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety 9 regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development  11227 general provisions  11228  b purpose the purpose of this section is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing within this jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in  11228a of this chapter this section seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives 1 meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the new york state department of environmental conservation state pollutant discharge elimination system spdes general permit for stormwater discharges

requirements of the new york state department of environmental conservation state pollutant discharge elimination system spdes general permit for construction activities permit no gp015003 as amended or revised  amended 11262018 by ll no 132018 3 minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development activities in order to reduce flooding siltation increases in stream temperature and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels  4 minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land development activities which would otherwise degrade local water quality  5 minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to the maximum extent practicable  and 6 reduce stormwater runoff
