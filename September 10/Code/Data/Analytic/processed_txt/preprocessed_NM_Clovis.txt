hazard areas footnotes  11  prior history   ords 116881 and 115380   findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss part 1987   purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by

of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  g to insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h to insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions part 1987   content in order to accomplish its purposes this ordinance includes methods and provisions for a restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwater  d controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas part 1987   interpretation in the

and conical zone such areas and zones are shown on the clovis municipal airport zoning map consisting of one sheet prepared by lydick engineers and surveyors and dated  which is attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and is made a part hereof as though set forth in this chapter the various zones are established and defined as follows a noninstrument approach zone a noninstrument approach zone is established at each end of all runways for noninstrument landings and takeoffs the noninstrument approach zone shall have a width of five hundred feet at a distance of two hundred feet beyond each end of the runways widening thereafter uniformly to a width of two thousand five hundred feet at a distance of ten thousand two hundred feet beyond each end of the runway its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway b transition zones transition zones are established adjacent to each runway and approach zone as indicated on the zoning map transition zones symmetrically located on either side of runways have variable widths as shown on the zoning map transition zones extend outward from a line two hundred fifty feet on either side of the centerline of the runways for the length of such runways plus two hundred feet on each end and are parallel and level with such runway centerlines the transition zones along such runways slope upward and outward one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the point where they intersect the surface of the horizontal zone further transition zones are established adjacent to the noninstrument approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones these transition zones have variable width as shown on the zoning map such transition zones flare symmetrically with either side of the runway approach zones from the base of such zones and slope upward and outward at the rate of one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the points where they intersect the

1999 part 1996   nonresidential uses in neighborhood conservation nc districts commercial uses may exist while the input received from the community in drawing the district boundaries indicated no desire to have additional commercial uses no serious concern with eliminating the nonconforming uses arose the intent of this title is to encourage those landowners with nonconforming uses to use to convert their use to a conforming conditional use therefore all existing nonconforming uses created by the designation of an nc district should be considered eligible for conditional use status in the district even though no designation in table  is shown part 1996   planned redevelopment overlay pro district uses the pro is a planned district in which the applicant must submit a site plan similar to a preliminary plat as required by the subdivision regulations of the city in addition the developer shall specify the uses that will actually be permitted in the proposed development once the plan is approved those uses shall be considered permitted as part of the conditional use process  all other uses not specifically cited in the approval of the pro district shall remain as shown in table  part 1996 a  established a planned unit development district is established and may be requested on any property within the city there is no minimum size requirement for property to be considered for

friction between various types of land uses g design incentives 1 to further certain goals and objectives that the city has determined should be promoted the following design incentives may be requested by the petitioners at the time a planned unit development is submitted for consideration a for developing property using the planned unit development requirements and promoting the objectives stated in maximum allowable densities may be increased up to ten percent b for the preservation of natural features such as floodways and flood channels with natural vegetation maximum allowable densities may be increased up to fifteen percent c for the use of landscaping or screening materials to serve as a buffer between different land uses maximum allowable densities may increase up to ten percent d for the preservation of the floodway or floodplain maximum allowable densities may be increased up to ten percent 2 if the planning and zoning commission or city commission finds

purpose many nonconformities have been in neighborhoods for a long time some may have only recently become nonconforming in many instances the use is an integral part of the neighborhoods function zonings purpose is to protect neighborhoods therefore if the community is comfortable with the particular use or structure the term nonconformity may not be what the community desires under such conditions the use may be mitigated and made conforming to remove the stigma typically associated with the obtainment of loans for a nonconforming use provide the procedures for making a nonconformity conform part 1996   procedure any major or minor nonconforming use building or structure lot or sign may apply for a conditional use permit for the use building or structure lot or sign part 1996   criteria for approval in addition to the criteria for a conditional use approval set forth in the applicant shall meet the following requirements a demonstrate that the use has minimal incompatibilities that have been integrated into the neighborhoods function factors to evaluate this criteria include 1 that the neighborhood residents patronize or are employed at the use for

by which the city evaluates the allegation that there is no beneficial use and can provide relief from the regulations by granting additional development potential to provide a beneficial use of the property it is also the intent of this section that such relief not increase the potential for damaging the health safety or welfare of future users of the property or neighbors that might reasonably be anticipated if the landowner were permitted to build b in the event that a landowner in clovis is of the opinion that all beneficial use of that landowners property has been denied or taken by the application of this title then the procedures of shall be used prior to seeking relief from the courts in order that any denial of beneficial use of property may be remedied nonjudicial forum part

regarding the sale of such property part 1996   deprivation standards in determining if a landowner has been deprived of beneficial use of property the hearing officer and the city commission shall take into account the following factors a diminution in value the value of the property prior to adoption of this title which caused the landowner to apply for relief shall be compared to the value of the property with the regulations as applied a mere diminution in value does not deprive the landowner of a beneficial use  the diminution must be so drastic that it effectively deprives the landowner of any significant use or enjoyment of the property b common land uses a use common to the city andor the area of the subject site although it may not involve further development of the land is considered a beneficial use attention shall also be given to land uses that are considered to be the lowest intensity in the city or adjoining areas but which uses still provide for occupation and living by the landowner these land uses shall be considered beneficial uses c unique treatment whether or not the property is being singled out for different treatment than similarly situated properties under this title d subsidy a minimum beneficial use of the land should be one that does not have any governmental subsidy attached to the use or longterm safe occupation of the property if such a subsidy exists then it should be reflected in considering minimum beneficial use on a valuation basis the public costs of a subsidy should be considered as a payment to the landowner for the restriction on the property if there is an annual subsidy that enhances the economic return of the existing use to the landowner to reflect the degree to which a subsidy enhances the property value the value of a proposed use shall be adjusted by determining value of the use without the subsidy e adverse impacts the extent to which the regulations protect users or neighbors from threats to health or safety shall be fully accounted for a use that seriously threatens the health of future residents or neighbors is not a beneficial use f expectations expectations shall in general not be considered expectations shall only be considered if they are backed by investments made prior to the adoption of the restrictions in question that are substantially above the cost of the land and normal planning investments shall they be considered g nuisances in no case shall a use that is a nuisance per se or a use that in that particular location constitutes a nuisance be granted as relief such uses are not legal uses of the land and thus no taking of beneficial use of the land can occur the hearing officer shall recommend denial if the proposed use or current use to be discontinued is a nuisance part 1996   granting of relief if the hearing officer finds a landowner has been denied all beneficial use of his property then he shall recommend that relief be granted a minimum increase in granting relief the landowner shall be given the minimum increase in use intensity or other possible concessions from this title to permit a beneficial use of the land the highest use or even an average reasonable expectation is not required or intended as the appropriate remedy the following guidelines shall be used for determining the minimum beneficial use of property and therefore the amount of relief to be granted a landowner to reach that minimum 1 the standards of be used to indicate the need for additional density or uses 2 the limited development potential given the natural condition of the property shall not be attributed to the regulations applied to the property if the property is such that it cannot safely accommodate development with normal grading and clearing practices this fact shall be taken into account in identifying the best site for development that minimizes costs of development any savings to the developer in land modification shall be considered in determining the beneficial use 3 the potential for damages to either residents or property shall be assessed in determining a beneficial use conditions shall be placed on sites where damage from building on hazardous conditions is likely the conditions may include location restrictions size limitations construction practices and shall require a building to be built so it will not be damaged b granting of relief the decision of the hearing officer shall be ratified by the city commission at its next regularly scheduled meeting the ratification shall be by resolution if the city commission does not ratify a grant of relief recommended by the hearing officer it shall conduct a public hearing to amend this title in accordance with the standards of no conditions shall relief be granted
