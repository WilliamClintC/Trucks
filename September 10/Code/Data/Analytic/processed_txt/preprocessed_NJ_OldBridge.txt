the flood hazard areas of the township of old bridge are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b the flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored causes damage in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruptions  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f help

property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  d controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers

conditions relating to a lot or lots proposed for development may be accommodated the standards herein establish the limits of discretionary action which may be taken by the approving board these standards are adopted pursuant to the authority of njsa d39b and c and no deviation from these standards may be granted pursuant to njsa d70 prior to the submissions of an application for development which proposes the utilization of an alternative development option set forth in this the developer is encouraged to take advantage of the concept plan review procedure under  optional development techniques generally as an alternative to conventional development the approving board may authorize one of the three alternative development options set forth herein in accordance with the standards herein established a density transfer option the density transfer option provides for reduced lot sizes in order to preserve a portion of the land in an open undeveloped state in contrast to a conventional subdivision the technique concentrates the allowable number of dwellings onto smaller lots occupying a lesser portion of the tract  this technique leaves other portions of the land undeveloped with a conventional subdivision some portions of the tract may be undevelopable and this will reduce the number of dwellings to less than that theoretically possible under the allowable density with the density transfer option the allowable density may still not be achieved but would be more achievable than conventional subdivision the density transfer option is intended to be employed on small tracts which contain critical lands and environmental constraints warranted and where development of extensive active recreation areas is not desirable or practicable b cluster option the cluster option expands on the concept of the density transfer option by further reducing lot sizes to provide special amenities it is intended to be employed to create suitable areas for organized outdoor recreation a pedestrian path network linking all parts of a development and a closed traffic circulation system these amenities are to be furnished in addition to protecting special environmental features covered by the density transfer option a special density bonus available under the cluster option is intended to encourage the development of housing for adult members of families whose children have moved from their households and who wish to have a lifestyle which will offer them less maintenance to house and grounds  25059 vehicles and traffic  25060   25061 density transfer option the approving board may authorize the use of reduced lot sizes for density transfer in accordance with the schedule of alternative development options attached hereto as appendix h and made a part hereof178  provided that where the proposed development meets the following qualifying criteria  25062 cluster option the approving board may authorize the use of reduced lot sizes for cluster development in accordance with the aforesaid schedule of alternative c planned development option the planned development option further expands on the density transfer and cluster options by allowing appropriate nonresidential uses to be incorporated into large scale residential development planned developments shall be composed of individual residential clusters each of which must individually satisfy the requirements for the cluster option a class i planned development may provide for convenience commercial facilities to be incorporated into a neighborhood scale residential development a class ii planned development may provide for more extensive nonresidential development to be incorporated into a larger community scale residential development both classes may provide for public and quasipublic land uses but only a class ii planned development may provide for a full range of neighborhood and community commercial facilities along with industrial land uses a the minimum tract size shall be five acres b allowable dwelling units may not be transferred between differing zones c the total number of lots created shall not exceed the allowable density multiplied by

contained in appendix i184 which is incorporated herein by reference and the proposals and conditions shown in the master plan 2 hierarchy in any major subdivision it shall be the duty of the approving board to classify proposed streets according to their 184 editors note appendix i schedule of required street dimensions is included at the end of this chapter  25071 old bridge code  25072  types in making a determination as to the classification of a particular street the board shall take into consideration the provisions of the master plan and the existing and proposed conditions within the subdivision a arterial roadways this class of roadway is primarily intended to form an interconnected system serving lengthy trips and linking major traffic generators the first and most important function of arterial roadways is to carry traffic and provision of access to adjoining property is relegated to a secondary function and is minimized with traffic volumes exceeding 10000 trips per day noise levels will normally exceed 65 decibels and with truck traffic can increase to 80 decibels or more  any residential units should therefore be set back at least 100 feet arterial roadways shall be assigned to one of the following three subclasses based on the volume of traffic they are intended to carry and shall satisfy the following standards in addition to those otherwise set forth in this chapter  major arterials this class of arterial roadway is intended to carry 25000 to 40000 trips per day traffic turning onto and off these road can reduce capacity and access points should be restricted as much as possible  minor arterials this class of arterial roadway is intended to carry 15000 to 25000 trips per day  light arterials this class of arterial roadway is intended to carry 10000 to 15000 trips per day b collector roadways collector roadways differ from arterials in that they should not form an interconnected system they should simply carry traffic to the arterials and should not form linkages and interconnections which would accommodate traffic which is unrelated to the uses which adjoin them this class of street is intended to siphon traffic from local streets before their capacity is exceeded and the two functions of traffic movement and property access are of equal importance traffic on collector roadways should be given priority over local streets and not interrupted by sharp turns or stop signs onstreet parking is undesirable and should be avoided where possible this class of collector roadway is intended to carry up to 10000 trips per day c local roadways local roadways differ from other roadways in that they are not intended to carry any traffic whatsoever the intended function of this class of roadway is to provide direct access to adjoining properties  traffic capacity is of only secondary importance 3 alignment  25072 vehicles and traffic  25072  a general  roads shall be related appropriately to the topography local roads
