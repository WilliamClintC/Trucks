merced to the year 2030 will result in traffic volumes in excess of capacity on the regional system of arterials highways and freeways as designated in this chapter b the city council finds that failure to expand the capacity of the existing circulation system will result in new development causing unacceptable levels congestion on the arterials highways and freeways of the regional system c the city council also finds and declares that in the absence of this chapter imposing a fairshare traffic fee upon new development existing and future sources of revenue are inadequate to fund substantial portions of the regional transportation system improvements needed to avoid unacceptable levels of congestion and related adverse impacts caused by new development  6212005 purpose a the city council finds and determines that adoption of this regional transportation impact fee ordinance will raise additional revenues needed to construct improvements to accommodate traffic that will be generated by new development within the county and city of gustine b the city council also finds and declares that the regional transportation impact fee study as amended has determined the extent to which the new development of land will generate traffic volumes impacting the roadway system and that this chapter establishes a fair and equitable method for distributing unfunded costs of transportation improvements necessary to accommodate traffic volumes generated by such development  6212005 specific findings the need for regional transportation improvements and for the regional transportation impact fee established by this chapter are based on the finding of the regional transportation impact fee study as amended prepared by the merced county association of governments whose governing board is composed of city council members and county supervisors from the countys six cities and the county board of supervisors the study has established that growth to the year 2030 will affect the entire regional transportation system and therefore that the area of impact for future development is appropriately the entire county of merced the study made the following additional findings 1 population and employment within the county of merced is anticipated to increase by 98 percent and 82 percent respectively by the year 2030 and will result in levels of service e and f as defined in the 1994 highway capacity manual on existing arterials highways and freeways 2 the regional transportation plan mcag 2004 modeled and evaluated the effect of projected growth to the year 2030 on all major arterials highways and freeways in merced county and found that without expansion the transportation system would suffer severe congestion further the plan showed that the recommended transportation improvements would accommodate the traffic anticipated in the year 2030 at the desired level of service d 3 existing and future sources of public revenues are insufficient to fund all the needed transportation improvements 4 the revenues generated by this regional transportation impact fee will provide additional funds necessary to construct the transportation improvements and will help provide the additional capacity needed in the year 2030 to accommodate the traffic generated by new development in the six cities and county of merced 5 the regional transportation impact fee is a fair and equitable method of distributing the cost of transportation improvements among the development that will generate the increased traffic  6212005 definitions

all signs a sign area measurement the measurement of sign area to determine compliance with the sign area limitations of this occur as follows 1 the surface area of a sign shall be calculated by enclosing the extreme limits of all framing writing logo representation emblem or other display within a single continuous perimeter composed of squares or rectangles with no more than eight lines see figure 39 2 supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself shall not be computed as sign area 67170  gustine ca zoningsubdivision 3 the area of a doublefaced backtoback sign shall be calculated as a single sign face if the distance between each sign face does not exceed 18 inches and the two faces are parallel with each other 4 where a sign consists of one or more threedimensional objects ie balls cubes clusters of objects sculpture or statuelike trademarks the sign area shall be measured as their maximum projection upon a vertical plane see figure 310 5 b the area of any time andor temperature device incorporated into a sign shall not be included in the calculation of total sign area freestanding sign height measurement the height of a freestanding sign shall be measured as the vertical distance from the lowest point of the base of the sign structure to the highest point of the structure where the lowest point of the base of the structure does not include fill planters or other material artificially placed to allow increased sign height see figure 311 c sign location requirements 1 all signs shall be located on the same site as the subject of the sign except as otherwise allowed by this sign in the downtown area may project over an adjacent public rightofway only when authorized by an encroachment permit and maintains a minimum of eight feet clearance 2 no sign shall be located within the public rightofway except as otherwise allowed by this the location of all signs shall be evaluated to ensure a that the setback is appropriate for the height and area of a freestanding or projecting sign  b that flush or projecting signs relate to the architectural design of the building signs that cover windows or that spill over natural boundaries andor cover architectural features shall be discouraged  d c that signs do not unreasonably block the sight lines of existing signs on adjacent properties  and d pedestrian and vehicular safety design criteria for signs the following design criteria shall be used in reviewing the design of individual signs substantial conformance with each of the following design criteria shall be required before a sign permit or building permit can be approved 1 color colors on signs and structural members should be harmonious with one another and relate to the dominant colors of the building or buildings being identified contrasting colors may be utilized if the overall effect of the sign is still compatible with the building colors and prevailing colors in the surrounding neighborhood where a theme can be identified 2 design and construction a proposed permanent signs should be designed by professionals eg architects building designers landscape architects interior designers or those whose principal business is the design manufacture or sale of signs or others who are capable of producing professional results 68170  gustine ca zoningsubdivision b all permanent signs should be constructed by persons whose principal business is building construction or a related trade including sign manufacturing and installation businesses or others capable of producing professional results the intent is to ensure public safety achieve signs of careful construction neat and readable copy and durability so as to reduce maintenance costs and to prevent dilapidation 3 materials and structure a sign materials including framing and supports should be representative of the type and scale of materials used on the site of the sign sign materials should match those used on the building and on other signs b materials for permanent signs shall be durable and capable of withstanding weathering over the life of the sign with reasonable maintenance c the size of the structural members eg columns crossbeams and braces should be proportional to the sign panel they are supporting in general fewer larger supporting members are preferable to many smaller supports d the use of individual letters incorporated into the building design is encouraged rather than signs with background and framing other than the building wall e the use of reflective materials or surfaces may be approved only where the review authority determines that these materials will not distract motorists or create other hazards and should be minimized in all cases 4 street address the review authority may require that a sign include the street address of the site where it determines that public safety and emergency vehicle response would be more effectively served than if the street address were displayed solely on one or more buildings on the site e copy design guidelines the city does not regulate the message content copy of signs  however the following are principles of copy design and layout that can enhance the readability and attractiveness of signs copy design and layout consistent with these principles is encouraged but not required 1 sign copy should relate only to the name andor nature of the business or commercial center 2 permanent signs that advertise continuous sales special prices or include phone numbers etc should be avoided 3 information should be conveyed briefly or by logo symbol or other graphic manner the intent should be to increase the readability of the sign and thereby enhance the identity of the business f 4 the area of letters or symbols should not exceed 40 percent of the background area in commercial districts or 60 percent in residential districts 5 freestanding signs should contain the street address of the parcel or the range of addresses for a multitenant center sign lighting the artificial illumination of signs either from an internal or external source shall be designed to minimize light and glare on surrounding rightsofway and properties 1 the city prefers that a sign be illuminated by lights within the sign although signs comprised of individually mounted internally lit letters are also acceptable in the case of a sign comprised of a metal cabinet with a face of plastic or similar material the face material shall be opaque except for the letters and artwork that convey the message it is the intent of the city that a cabinet sign be designed and constructed to appear as much as possible as illuminated individual letters 2 external light sources shall be directed and shielded so that they do not produce glare on any object other than the sign andor off the site of the sign 3 the light from an illuminated sign shall not be of an intensity or brightness that will interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of residential properties in areas with low ambient nighttime illumination levels ie areas of the city with little or no illuminated signing a sign should be designed to use light illuminated copy against a dark or opaque background 4 sign illumination shall not blink flash flutter or change light intensity brightness or color 5 colored lights shall not be used at a location or
