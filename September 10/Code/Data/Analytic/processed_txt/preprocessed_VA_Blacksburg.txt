the virginia stormwater management act virginia 16031 et seq and all other state or federal regulations governing stormwater management   61014 eff 1115  findings and purpose the town council finds that an adequate sustainable source of revenue for stormwater management activities is necessary to protect the general health safety and welfare of the residents of the town further the council finds that property with higher amounts of impervious area contributes greater amounts of stormwater and pollutants to the stormwater management system and waters of the commonwealth and should carry a proportionate burden of the cost however stormwater runoff is associated with all improved properties in the town whether residential or nonresidential and the individual property impacts of runoff are correlated to the amount of impervious surface on the property and landdisturbing activities on the property the elements of stormwater management infrastructure provide benefits and services to properties within the town protection of property control of flooding and protection of the towns natural environment therefore the council determines that it is in the best interests of the public to establish a stormwater management utility and stormwater utility fees that allocate program costs to all property owners based on impervious area   61014 eff 1115  definitions the following words and

apartments are not by right uses and have not been permitted for many years however the blacksburg town council has determined that under certain circumstances it may be appropriate to allow an accessory apartment in conjunction with a detached single family home annual permit program done successfully an accessory apartment permit program can promote home ownership owner residency affordable housing aging in place mixed age and income neighborhoods and university related student or faculty housing b the majority of virginia tech students live off campus in different types of housing based on its experience with absentee landlords and single family homes rented by students the blacksburg town council has found that owner occupied properties in the town are better maintained and cause fewer problems in residential neighborhoods the owner occupancy requirement in this accessory apartment permit program exists as a counterbalance to prevent neighborhood problems such as noise and trash that may be created by the additional housing that will be permitted owner occupancy is also consistent with a primary goal of this program which is to provide aginginplace options it is for these reasons that the town council finds that the owner occupancy requirement will prevent the deterioration of neighborhoods and is substantially related to land use impact making it a land use regulation instead of a regulation of the land owner because of the importance of owner occupancy in the towns creation of this accessory apartment permit program this requirement shall not be considered to be severable c because of these concerns about residential overoccupancy and impacts on neighborhood character accessory apartments shall be permitted only under the conditions set forth in this division and zoning    41117  general provisions a accessory apartments are permitted only in the rr1 rr2 and r4 zoning districts b are nonconforming with regard to minimum lot size

instead a vital and lively streetscape created by commercial buildings with windows and entrances oriented to the street is an important goal of this district while residential uses are allowed in the district under some circumstances such uses should complement the commercial uses that serve as the primary intent in this district  1 21219 permitted uses a the following uses and structures are

allow greater development latitude districts should be proposed and planned for areas that provide for adequate development and expansion space landscaped parking areas and service utilities and other facilities because the development of the planned commercial district takes place in accordance with an approved development plan adequate separation from adjacent areas of incompatible land use can be achieved b planned commercial districts can be a visual asset to the community buildings within the district are to be architecturally similar in style and the tract well landscaped parking and loading areas are to be screened and pedestrianvehicular separation achieved the relationship among individual establishments is to be harmonious since the character of the principal tenants the size of the land to be developed the relationship of the development to the community and prospects for economic success of the project have much to do with the physical character of the development these

housing for student organizations including greek organizations and service clubs or other chartered groups bound by a common purpose or national organization ideally special housing would be among the most attractive and wellmaintained housing in a college community special housing use also may serve to preserve older residences and contributing historical structures within the town preserving the residential character of a neighborhood as well special housing poses significant challenges to the harmony of a neighborhood these challenges stem from the number of people living together within the residence the number of nonresident members of the organization that visit the house for organization business and the number of people who attend social and entertainment events sponsored by the organization in addition use special housing can fall into disrepair through the conditional use permit requirements contained in this overlay district the town seeks to permit special housing and to address the unique challenges that this type of housing entails in this way the town seeks to facilitate the creation of a convenient attractive and harmonious community  41409 applicability the
