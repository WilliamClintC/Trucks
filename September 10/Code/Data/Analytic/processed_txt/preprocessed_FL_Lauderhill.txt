crash statistics report five hundred fifty 550 pedestrians were killed on florida roadways in 2007  sixtyfive 65 of those pedestrians were killed on roadways in broward county  and 3 based upon statistics collected by the surface transportation policy project the miamifort lauderdale area is one of the most dangerous areas in the united states for pedestrians  and 4 the city has experienced

children adolescents and adults who seek to collect money for school and community activities  vendors who sell flowers newspapers and other products  and people who seek donations or distribute written information  and 6 rightofway solicitors peddlers and canvassers approach motorists and passengers in motor vehicles engaged in travel on roads and are particularly susceptible and vulnerable to serious injury or death due to the speed and number of motorists who operate vehicles on busy roads within the city  and 7 roads are primarily designed for vehicular traffic and are not suited to

the city is substantially burdened by a high volume of traffic and road design frequently includes complex vehicle turn movements that demand a drivers strict attention  and  lauderhill fl ordinances 500653 11 it is the intention of the city commission to use the least restrictive means to advance the significant governmental interests of traffic safety and public safety and consequently the city

and rightofway solicitors peddlers and canvassers and pose the greatest threat to traffic and public safety in reference to activities and use by rightofway solicitors peddlers and canvassers and therefore the city commission has determined that such activities and use by rightof way solicitors peddlers and canvassers shall be prohibited on the roadways listed in subsection c below  and 12 it is the finding of the city commission that many other alternative channels of communication other than rightof way solicitation peddling and canvassing on the prohibited roadways exist for persons who seek to exercise their first amendment freedoms such as but by no means limited to solicitation of funds or distribution of literature mail or at alternate locations such as houses of worship shopping areas and special events  the sale andor distribution of newspapers or office delivery vending machines and retail stores  and the sale of goods and services at retail stores internet and from vending machines  and 15 the city commission desires to preserve and protect the personal safety and quality of life of its residents and of those who use streets within the city both pedestrians and motorists alike  and 14 the city commission has reviewed the proposed regulations provided by this section and finds that such regulations accomplish the purposes intended while utilizing the least restrictive means to further and protect the health and safety of its residents and those who use the citys designated roadways  and 15 the city commission finds that it is in the best interests of

expressions it is therefore the purpose and intent of the city commission to try to strike a reasonable balance and achieve a reconciliation of such uses which occasionally compete with each other by the enactment of regulations which are content neutral as to the subject matter of expressions of opinions or of the viewpoints of a person or a group furthermore the city commission wishes to ensure that such regulations are tailored to avoid undue restrictions upon or intrusions into personal freedoms of expression and to further ensure that reasonable alternative modes of communications are available in addition the city commission is aware that use of the parks and recreation facilities by commercial and forprofit users may result in damage to the parks and recreation facilities greater

conclusions and intent the city commission makes the following findings conclusions and intent 1 the finding that before march 28 th  200 vehicularrelated uses were allowed within the zoning district as a special exception use  and 2 the finding that before february 25 th  200 a special exception use development order for a vehicular related use at a specific location could be transferred from one owner to another  and 3 the finding that provides that effective february 25 th  200 a special exception use development order for a vehicular related use cannot be transferred from one person to another  and 4 the finding that provides that effective march 28 th  200 any vehicularrelated use within the cpo zoning district is a prohibited use  and 5 the conclusion that an internal inconsistency exists between the cpo zoning district and the cw zoning district because the cw zoning district allows indoor and outdoor vehicular related uses including auto wreaking while the cpo zoning district prohibits such use  and 6 the conclusion that to resolve the internal inconsistency the cw zoning district provisions must be amended to prohibit vehicular related uses including auto wreaking services  and 7 the finding that three vehicular related use businesses are operating at a location where a special exception use development order was issued to allow such use at such location  however all three businesses operate a use that was prohibited by the development order a fourth vehicular related use business is operating at a location different from that authorized in the special exception use development order but within the same building  and 8 the finding the city issued an occupational license to each of these four businesses before april 1 st  200 effectively allowing the operation of the vehicular related uses and the finding the city subsequently has granted annually a renewal of the occupational license for each business  and 9 the conclusion that case law provides that a land use is not vested simply because the local government has mistakenly issued an occupational license for the use  and 10 the conclusion that terminating these longstanding business on the mistaken issuance or renewal of an occupational license would create significant hardship financial loss and lost jobs and that additional time should be granted to allow for the relocation of the businesses from the district  and 11 the intent of this to allow those businesses along nw 38 th avenue to continue to operate as legal nonconforming uses until september 30 th  2017 can make significant investments that these investments would be lost if the city immediately terminates the business and that these businesses should be provide additional time to relocate b legal nonconforming use amortization any person operating an illegal nonconforming vehicular related use within the cwcpo zoning district or any successor zoning district who was issued an occupational license before april 1 st  2000 and who has annually received a renewal of their occupational license shall be classified as a legal nonconforming vehicular related use and shall be allowed to continue to operate at the currently licensed location until september 30 th  201 provided conformance with one of the following factors is established 1 the person was granted a special exception use development order to operate a vehicular related use at a specific location but is now operating at a different business address  or 2 the person is operating a vehicular related use pursuant at the location specified in an effectively transferred special exception use development order for a vehicular related use but the person is operating a specific vehicular related use outside the scope of

facilities in a specific area if upon completion of the new facilities the prescribed levels of service will be met  112601 editors note formerly  41 determination of available capacity a for purposes of these regulations the available capacity of a facility shall be determined by a adding together 1 the total design capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service  and 2 the total design capacity of new facilities that will become available concurrent with the impact of the development the capacity of new facilities may be counted only if one 1 or more of the following is shown a the necessary facilities are in place at the time a plat approval issued or a plat approval is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities will be in place when the impacts of development occur b construction of the new facilities is under way at the time of application c the new facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for the construction of the facilities to be constructed within a period of time as stipulated in the contract or the provision of services at the time the development permit is issued d the new facilities have been included in the city capital improvement program annual budget e the new facilities are guaranteed at a specific time in an enforceable development agreement such facilities must be consistent with the capital improvements element of the city comprehensive plan and approved by the city engineer f the developer has contributed funds to the city or county necessary to provide new facilities consistent with the capital improvements element of the city comprehensive plan commitment that the facilities will be built must be evidenced by an appropriate budget amendment and appropriation by the city or other governmental entity g the proposed development does not place any trips on the over capacity roadway link h there is an approved action plan to accommodate the traffic impact of the

service and recordable instruments guaranteeing the construction consistent with calculations of capacity above 2 the proposed project may be altered such that projected level of service is no less than the adopted level of service d concurrency monitoring system generally the following method of ensuring concurrency shall be known as the system for the management of concurrency symcon the symcon is based upon the city comprehensive plan especially the capital improvements element and adopted level of service standards the system is designed to ensure that the issuance of a final development order will not result in a degradation of the adopted levels of service for specified public facilities and services the symcon also includes a monitoring system for determination of the availability of adequate capacity of public facilities and services to meet the adopted level of service standards adopted levels of service shall not be degraded general rule 1 all applications for development orders shall demonstrate that the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service in the city 2 an application for a development permit shall demonstrate that the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service if there exists no development order under which the permit is sought and no development order is required prior to the issuance of the permit eg a residence on a parcel of unplatted land 3 the latest point at which concurrency is determined is the final development order if no development is required the latest point to determine concurrency is the first development permit on a site exception notwithstanding the foregoing the prescribed levels of service may be degraded during the actual construction of new facilities if upon completion of the new facilities the prescribed levels of service will be met 1 responsibility the director of planning and zoning or whomever is designated by the city manager in the absence of the director of planning and zoning duties and authority as chairman of the development review committee shall be responsible for monitoring development activity to ensure the development is consistent with the city

reserved at time of final action of an approved site plan or enforceable developers agreement for those concurrency matters within the authority of the city of lauderhill applications for development approval shall be chronologically logged to determine rights to available capacity the concurrency time limit for plats after  will be five 5 years for water sewer roadways drainage and solid waste developers agreements as described in offer a valid concurrency period for five 5 years or as modified by the florida local government development agreement act site plans must be submitted for approved plats within two 2 years of plat approval and the effective time limit for site plans will be six 6 months an extension of six 6 months may be issued by the director of community development

construction recreation concurrency shall be in effect forever building and engineering permits will have a concurrency time limit of one hundred eighty 180 days with renewals of one hundred eighty 180 days as long as construction and inspection continues all renewals must be applied for in writing prior to the appropriate expiration date 5 infrastructure construction if infrastructure construction is necessary to meet adopted levels of service the developer must complete construction and issue performance bonds to insure completion of work within the concurrency time limit or risk forfeiture of favorable concurrency status if a developer in the area wishes to complete offsite infrastructure construction that may or may not be a part of other effective developers agreements he may do so in accordance with a new developers agreement that may entail reimbursable clauses for offsite work and facility oversizing to meet area needs the original developer will be contacted concerning the changes in work from the approved agreement it shall first be determined by the city that modifying the original developers agreement is in the best interests of the city in this case the original developer must pay reasonable infrastructure costs to new developer under the terms of the original or modified developers agreement 6 development permit approval or disapproval

renumbered the former sections 12 and 117 as a new section 140 dynamic displays 151 findings and conclusions the city commission makes the following findings of fact and conclusions to support schedule i 0 a studies show that there is a correlation between dynamic displays on signs and the distraction of highway drivers distraction can lead to traffic accidents drivers can be distracted not only by a changing message but also by knowing that the sign has a changing message drivers may watch a sign waiting for the next change to occur drivers also are distracted by messages that do not tell the full story in one look people have a natural desire to see the end of the story and will continue to look at the sign in order to wait for the end additionally drivers are more distracted by special effects used to change the message such as fadeins and fadeouts finally drivers generally are more distracted by messages that are too small to be clearly seen or that contain more than a simple message time and temperature signs appear to be an exception to these concerns because the messages are short easily absorbed and become inaccurate without frequent changes b despite these public safety concerns there is merit to allowing new technologies to easily update messages except as prohibited by state or federal law sign owners should have the opportunity to use these technologies with certain conditions or restrictions the conditions or restrictions are intended to minimize potential driver distraction and to minimize proliferation in those zoning districts where signs can adversely impact the character of the area within the zoning district c local spacing requirements could interfere with the equal opportunity to use such technologies and are not included without those requirements however there is the potential for numerous dynamic displays to exist along any roadway if more than one dynamic display can be seen from a given location on a road the minimum display time becomes critical if the display time is too short a driver could be subjected to a view that appears to have constant movement this impact would obviously be compounded in a corridor with multiple signs if dynamic displays become pervasive and there are no meaningful limitations on each signs ability to change frequently drivers may be subjected to an unsafe degree of distraction and sensory overload therefore a longer display time is appropriate d a constant message is typically needed on a sign so that the public can use it to identify and find an intended destination changing messages detract from this wayfinding purpose and could adversely affect driving conduct second lane changes stops or turns which could result in traffic accidents accordingly dynamic displays generally should not be allowed to occupy the entire copy and graphic area of a sign e in conclusion the city commission finds that dynamic displays should be allowed on signs but with significant controls to minimize their proliferation and their potential threats to public safety 152 regulatory conditions or restrictions dynamic display signs are allowed subject to the following conditions a one 1 doublefaced dynamic display pylon sign is allowed within a unified development that is located within the open space and recreational s1 and commercial recreation cr

out herein see also the table of amendments introduction the city of lauderhill design standards are intended to supplement the existing lauderhill land development regulations these standards take into consideration the distinct character of florida and more specifically the city of lauderhill they are formulated to facilitate the development of a viable city design which is conducive to the overall enjoyment and safety of residents and visitors the standards also seek to keep intact the elements that lend lauderhill its unique character while improving the overall aesthetic and functional quality of the city sample images for lauderhill street and intersection improvements the lauderhill design standards and guidelines are divided into nine 9 sections accompanied by a foreword and two 2 appendices each section is preceded by a brief introduction followed by a categorized enumeration of development standards and guidelines design standards are the performance criteria used to evaluate and approve any new development or alterations to an existing development which standards must be complied with in order to secure a site plan or site plan modification community appearance committee development order and building permit further these design standards and guidelines are supplemented with photographs diagrams and sketches where relevant to help assist in interpreting the intent of the standard and guidelines the design standards and guidelines are organized into nine sections that may be summarized as follows introduction this is a brief overview or outline of the various sections representing the lauderhill tropical design standards and guidelines general design standards the general design standards applies to all nonresidential developments and is an overarching framework within which site specific and detail recommendations can be made it establishes effective design paradigms and focuses on determining techniques for best practice it also addresses the necessary procedures required for certification and approval by organizations such the us green building council and american with disabilities act ada standards architectural standards architectural standards provide standards and guidelines for effective massing techniques with respect to architecture they are a mechanism by which aesthetic control may be exercised when designing sites with building clusters this section also includes standards for building distances and height limits and setbacks as well as guidelines for treatment of building faades and frontages street level standards the street level standards are oriented toward fostering positive relationships between the public and their environment by specifically addressing elements within the pedestrian realm they are intended to govern the functional and aesthetic quality of streets and other corridors these standards pertain to aspects such as plaza design water features sculpture and art and sidewalks landscape and irrigation standards the landscape and irrigation standards is a guide to open space development within the city this section enumerates the requirements for landscaped areas in lauderhill and provides suggestions for development the landscape and irrigation standards aim to improve the overall vegetative aesthetic of lauderhill with a specific focus on streetscape and parking areas given that they comprise a significant percentage of open space in the city they are also intended to promote efficient irrigation systems and to perpetuate sustainable water conservation practices signage and graphics standards the signage and graphics standards address the role played by signage and its influence on the visual environment it includes principles and requirements for public signage such as informational and directional signs this section addresses standards for entry and gateway signage as well as signage for retail establishments site furnishings standards site furnishings play an important role in the overall quality and experience of a space the site furnishings standards outline principles and requirements for the proper selection and placement of elements such as benches bike racks trash receptacles planters etc the suggested furnishings are part of the city standard helping to provide continuity in the overall environment lighting standards the lighting standards provide a set of standards which ensure a coordinated and efficient lighting system within lauderhill it addresses issues of safety adequate illumination scale and location this section is divided into streetscape lighting pedestrian lighting and landscape lighting road and parking design standards the road and parking design standards provide principles and requirements that aim to create an integrated system of circulation that is conducive to pedestrian and vehicular safety these standards outline the design requirements for typical rightsofway and provide illustrations for further clarification this section also enumerates basic parking requirements for the city of lauderhill the sections are meant to promote development redevelopment and improvements that fulfill all the desired criteria with respect to image scale and livability  2222010 general design standards the design standards and guidelines contained herein in schedule p shall apply when one 1 or more of the following circumstances occur  new development  or  redevelopment which is defined as the demolition of any structure or building or a portion thereof and the construction of new improvements on a site or sites intended to be  or  substantial improvements which is defined as any repair reconstruction or improvement of a structure which increases the building area or size of the original structure by ten 10 percent of more  or  any development or improvements within the rt15 zoning district  or  service station rebranding or reimaging 21 design objectives specific site design objectives will be drawn up based on the conclusions and observations derived from the site analysis however all design shall aim toward fulfilling the following basic goals  encourage appropriate building massing where scale function and light requirements are well respected  provide appropriate transitions between pedestrian and vehicular zones in order to ensure safety and mobility  minimize negative environmental impacts such as air light and noise pollution excessive surface drainage etc effective landscape design  provide efficient systems of circulation which are compliant with existing development codes and parking standards  create a strong and viable community environment where outdoor activities and positive interaction between neighborhoods is enhanced design 22 contextual relationships any new development redevelopment substantial improvements or service station rebranding shall contribute positively to existing neighborhoods and communities therefore it is important that all plans and proposals take into account the value architectural quality physical connectivity and landscape character of adjacent sites all plan documents shall show in adequate detail neighboring buildings and important site features of adjacent areas such that they facilitate the evaluation of relationships between any proposed development and the context within which it is situated when considering connectivity to adjacent areas it is required that existing street patterns and sidewalks extend to connect to existing circulation patterns this measure is to ensure a continuous and cohesive circulation system throughout the city it is also important to link new development to established existing areas in order to encourage internal circulation by pedestrians bicycles and motorized vehicles such measures guarantee that proposed development does not occur against the grain of the existing fabric but is instead conducive to it specifically all applicants for new development redevelopment substantial improvements or service station rebranding are required to submit a complete analysis of existing conditions both on site and on adjacent properties such an analysis will include an examination of the sites physical elements amenities and opportunities and constraints this analysis shall be executed by a licensed design professional although the process and submittal requirements might vary by project the following basic information would usually be required  general location map  and  overall adjacent land use map and views ie street elevations  and  property boundaries  and  street and rightofway locations  and  existing built structures  and  existing vegetationspecies counts location and sizes  and  existing topography and drainage 23 purpose or intent the city of lauderhill design standards and guidelines are intended to implement the comprehensive plan supplement these existing land development regulations and conform to the most recent edition of the building codes 24 florida building proposed development redevelopment building and structural improvements are required to comply with and conform to the most recent version of the applicable florida building as amended from time to time site design recommendations shall adhere to the planning codes enumerated in the sections on building florida residential other standards the ones pertaining to building heights location of exterior walls dwelling unit separation exterior coverings and exterior wall finishes are particularly relevant and shall be used as a general foundation for all site design 25 ada standards for accessible design all site design has to take into account the standards enumerated in the ada standards for accessible design handbook this handbook includes standards for various categories of design involving both interior and exterior spaces all site design shall adhere to accessible sites and exterior facilities which lists the necessary requirements for any new construction including but not limited to accessibility ground surfaces parking and signage all building design shall conform to the latest edition of the federal ada or local municipal requirements 26 leed design standards site design shall aim toward conforming to leadership in energy and environmental design leed standards as much as possible the leed for new construction and major renovation rating system shall be utilized for all buildings constructed and intended for city use the city strives for leed silver certified buildings leed for neighborhood development which is in its pilot phase shall also serve as a guiding principle under which design recommendations will be made the following are the primary mandates of the leed system  reducing urban sprawl  encouraging healthy living  protecting threatened species  increasing transportation choices and decreasing automobile dependence  creating sustainable sites  enhancing water efficiency  optimizing energy performance  recycling materials  creating innovative design solutions these objectives are accompanied by a detailed checklist that includes parameters such as bicycle networks restoration of habitat diversity of uses walkable streets percentage wateruse reduction storm water design construction waste management daylight and views etc all design shall be assessed against such criteria and attempts shall be made to adhere closely to the list and to avoid shortfalls this checklist shall serve not only as a measure of successful design but also as a guiding document governing the design for most situations it is suggested that all design development and redevelopment projects seek out design professionals with leed certified team members it is also recommended that relevant examples be researched and used as inspiration for projects where applicable these projects could range from instate sites to national examples with similar contexts more information can be found on the us green building council website  27 cpted standards crime prevention through environmental design cpted is an important factor in determining the efficiency of any site design cpteds goal is to prevent crime by designing a physical environment that positively influences human behavior these standards include aspects such as access control and surveillance means such as landscaping and street design these include techniques such as keeping pathways unobstructed discouraging landscaping that avoids blind spots or hiding spots keeping opengreen spaces in visual proximity to homes and effective lighting it is important that neighborhoods promote a sense of safety and comfort and cpted standards therefore become an integral part of good design  2222010   2 4252011   3312014   1122015 architectural standards architectural standards aim to guide the articulation of buildings with regards to massing faade treatments and elements all these aspects form a significant part of the expression of individual buildings and in their totality affect the overall quality of the built environment 31 massing architectural massing standards are intended to create variation and interest in the positioning of buildings within the prescribed restrictions for heights setbacks and distances building mass should reinforce the importance of the street  building heights building height refers to the vertical distance from the average finished grade of the adjacent ground to the top of the structure at the highest roof beams of a flat roof the deck of a mansard roof or the mean level of the highest gable or slope of a hip roof maximum building heights are summarized in schedule c zoning district development standards and are described in more particularity in the zoning district regulations contained in base or underlying zoning districts and overlay zoning districts this maximum might be exceeded by up to fifteen 15 feet in order to accommodate unoccupied hierarchical architectural structures which might include aesthetic features such as cupolas or infrastructural elements such as camouflaged telecommunication antenna height is measured from adjacent average finished grade to the highest point on the building design standards  allowable maximum building heights vary by zoning districts and occasionally by land use classifications the maximum allowable building height within higher intensity residential multifamily districts is one hundred 100 feet or eight 8 stories but may be higher it mixed use zoning districts within nonresidential zoning districts the most intensive zoning district allows a maximum building height of seventyfive 75 feet maximum building heights may exceed seventyfive 75 feet within that area designated in the comprehensive plan as transit oriented corridors  the allowable maximum height of parking lot light poles is twentyfive 25 feet design guidelines  new development shall be scaled to conform to existing development by stepping down building heights in order to promote greater neighborhood compatibility  when building heights exceed five 5 stories it is recommended that the vertical plane is moderated by introducing a horizontal dimension this may be done by creating stepbacks along the building faade these horizontal moderators are especially important along two 2 to four 4 lane streets in order to create the illusion of fragmented building mass  the stepback transition may be achieved by adding a balcony or terrace on the sixth level plants and soft landscape elements should be introduced along this transitional line in order to create visual interest these stepbacks should serve as outdoor living spaces that provide a more humanistic aspect to tall uniform structures a 15 stepback on a building higher than 5 stories  setbacks building setbacks are required in all zoning districts although minimum build to lines may be established within the state road 7 community redevelopment area ldr establishes a list of structures and features that are allowed within the building setbacks sidewalks street trees and signage are all approved features for setbacks 32 faade treatment and materials buildings should relate to the streets in a manner that enhances and strengthens pedestrian activity streetlevel architectural development should be scaled to the pedestrian and should be attractive and inviting the prevailing character of the design is generally found in the elevation of the building with the use of molding quoins and fretwork they come together to form what is the faade of the project successful designs are typically strong and simple with clear intent and detail treatment a colonnade or veranda is consistent with this tropical vernacular and assists in identifying a strong entrance design standards  all building elevations are required to have at least three 3 different material applications for visual interest  faades shall impart traditional themes of colonial architecture setbacks or protrusions in the faade can give visual relief brick coursework should have some detail and depth or should use traditional methods that enhance elevations and frame fenestration and door openings  materials for faade shall be of stucco smooth or textured hardboard brick zinc precast concrete or other suitable material that is appropriate to the florida tropical theme and the south florida climate detailed molding around fenestration and door openings is recommended the use of decorative railing of ornate lines and themes is strongly encouraged along flat roof parapets or along large linear expenses of the faade small or broken shed roofs accents or awnings are also encouraged along a blank faade simulated or nonarchitectural stonework such as applied river stone or scored brick face is not permitted  new construction shall have the maximum amount of transparent window area on the street front elevations or a percentage relative to the square footage of the building wall in which it is contained as determined by development review a minimum of forty 40 percent opening is required  storefront offices in structures originally designed for retail should be maintained or restored to its original configuration as long as that is consistent with the citys design theme  infill storefront design shall be compatible with these design standards for architecture of this building type in the area details and architectural features should relate to the entire building or block a design theme consistent with the tropical environment is expected to be employed at the time of renovation addition or update  roll down gates security shutters and bars are not permitted without approval from the planning and zoning board iron work or shutters shall be of design vernacular or design elements that conceal the primary use of the element as security  storm shutters may be deployed upon the issuance of a storm warning from the governing agency authorized to issue such warning  columns and posts are recommended as the perimeter support element for the covered entrances verandas and walkway areas a series of columns in wood steel or concrete with arches or beams are strong elements in creating scale and passive barrier  surface treatment shall include ceramic tile with designed patterns and strong colors crests textured stucco finishes and painting techniques employed to provide character accents repetition in accent elements along a faade or wall is encouraged as a simple way to tie a design together provide a strong base and establish a datum line at the user scale  lighting fixtures shall be of materials design colors and image as provided

pedestrians from inclement weather  sidewalks should not be composed of materials that might be dangerous or uncomfortable under any conditions  sidewalks must be safely separated from vehicular circulation routes by provision of a curb andor landscape treatment  minimum sidewalk width must be five 5 feet in all neighborhoods and commercial areas  the attitude of tropical design in an urban setting encourages the shift of the building back towards the street side while relocating the parking to the rear of the complex this reverts the hierarchal component back to the pedestrian community a paved pedestrian walk or colonnade to provide cover and intermittent landscaping would be the end solution streetscapes should include desirable elements such as planters shade structures site

contributing to the tropical feel of the region plantings should provide a common framework and be governed by both the aesthetic qualities of the varying materials and the functional concerns of different areas within the city in addition there should be a consideration towards preserving existing plant material and attempts should be made to utilize native species as much as possible landscape plantings will provide important spatial definitions to the city of lauderhill they will aid in establishing a strong identity for the city while visually unifying its streets sidewalks medians open spaces and yards full and healthy plantings will also help mitigate the south florida climate and will create year round habitable spaces plantings also help in the screening of unsightly views of parking garages and lots exposed utility areas and loading zones proper use of landscape plantings will also aid in directing pedestrian traffic city 51 purpose the intent of these regulations is to protect preserve and enhance the natural environment and the beauty of the city it will provide landscape for green spaces trees and other plants and arranging them in a pleasing manner in relation to paved areas and structures the planting of native materials is highly desirable and preferred these objectives are defined in general terms and the realization can only be obtained by proper design and location of trees shrubs plants and grass 52 streetscape planting streetscape planting will serve two 2 major purposes within the city of lauderhill namely the provision of shade along sidewalks and the creation of visual connectivity between different parts of the city design standards  the location of street trees should provide a strong buffer between vehicular traffic zones and pedestrian zones  continuous street tree trenches should be encouraged throughout the city to provide soil area for roots to spread and water to penetrate trenches should be approximately thirty 30 inches deep and six 6 to eight 8 feet wide running continuously parallel to the curb street tree trenches promote a healthier tree canopy which in turn provides more shade and stronger roots systems to fight overturning during storms street trees should provide shade and separation from vehicular zones street planting should be consistent in spacing and quality design guidelines  a strong tree program should be created along primary and secondary roadways  street trees should be at a consistent distance from each other and should be of the highest quality  shade trees should be encouraged in order to create outdoor spaces that are habitable all year 53 buffering and screening when properly planted landscaping can be an effective technique to screen utility areas and to protect building elements dense planting along parking structures and busy streets can soften edges and buffer noise from habitable areas such as residential neighborhoods open spaces schools etc proper placement of understory plantings coupled with climbing vines medium shrubs palms and trees are strongly desired to minimize views design standards  situations where screening interferes with function and circulation within spaces must be avoided for example when screening cars in a parking lot allowance must be made for vehicle dimensions such as open door radii and vehicle overhangs screening should not interfere with function the following is a list of plant materials considered acceptable for screening purposes palms botanical name common name acoelorrhaphe

proper species selection and planting placement can funnel breezes to desired areas efforts should be made to identify and locate areas that might detract from the overall visual quality of a space and to effectively screen these planting techniques 54 perimeter landscaping perimeter landscaping should be used to separate different land uses from one another and to create boundaries between utility zones and other use areas design standards  perimeter strips at a minimum of five 5 feet in width must be introduced between the abutting property line and any offstreet parking areas except that this standard may be waived if it is zoned under the citys smartcode one 1 tree and a hedge or other durable landscape material must be planted for every thirtyfive 35 lineal feet within this

establishing a sense of security and unity throughout the city of lauderhill although the primary function of site lighting is to provide nighttime orientation and security light fixtures become visible site elements that contribute significantly to the overall urban character light fixtures should therefore be cohesive with thematic variations consistent between streetscape lighting pedestrian lighting and any added decorative fixtures the city of lauderhill strives to adhere to lighting guidelines established by the international dark sky association ida the guidelines outline ways to preserve and protect the night sky the ida recommends light bulbs and fixtures that abide by these standards the city of lauderhill urges new development and any amendments to existing development to utilize lighting design that is dark sky compliant light fixtures must be scaled based on the spaces within which they are being implemented in general the larger the scale of the use the higher the mounting light will be the size of the fixture should also be in proportion to the height of the pole it is mounted on various uses require different types of lighting light is measured in footcandles this unit measures the intensity of light falling on a surface equal to one 1 lumen per square foot and originally defined with reference to a standardized candle burning at one 1 foot from a given surface the following suggested minimum average maintained footcandle levels should be provided for the city  intersections 10 fc  side streets 08 fc  parking lots 10 fc  promenade 10 fc  sidewalks 06 fc  landscape lighting varies several different light sources are available for site lighting with characteristic advantages and disadvantages to each the following general standards are included for selection of an appropriate light source  high pressure sodiumbecause of its high efficiency and long lamp life highpressure sodium should be the predominant light source throughout the city of lauderhill it should be used on all streets and parking lots it should however be avoided in areas of high pedestrian use because of its poor rendition qualities  metal halidealthough not as efficient as highpressure sodium metal halide is much more pleasant in high pedestrian areas because it illuminates with true colors it should be considered for large scale gathering spaces such as plazas and major pedestrian routes  color corrected mercury vapormercury vapor is less efficient than metal halide and should be used only in low voltage situations where efficiency is not critical it may also be used to accent landscape plant material because of its ability to emphasize green foliage  compact fluorescentcfls give off the same amount of light as incandescent lighting but use less power and have a longer rated life cfls may be used in lowlevel pedestrian scale fixtures at building entries or in small courtyards  led lightingled lights are an energy efficient technique to light areas with more diffuse lighting requirements these lights utilize much less power and provide softer lighting they are thus effective in highlighting architectural and hardscape elements in the dark and in providing mellow lighting that can be well incorporated into landscape and plantings led lights also last longer than other lighting types and is thus easier to maintain led lights can be used in signage building and landscape accent lighting 81 streetscape lighting the main objective of streetscape lighting is to provide sufficient illumination for vehicular and pedestrian safety and to improve the aesthetic quality of the citys streets design guidelines  lighting should be hierarchical varying in intensity between major thoroughfares and side streets  fixtures along streets shall be

ambience differentiating pedestrian facilities from adjacent vehicular zones pedestrian lighting should create a positive ambience design standards  the fixtures poles and bollards must have a human scale and should compliment hardscape and other streetscape elements 83 landscape lighting in many instances appropriate light levels and pleasant accent effects may be achieved use of landscape lighting accent spotlight fixtures provide low intensity but often dramatic illumination of nearby pedestrian areas design standards  when used landscape accent lights should be unobtrusive in appearance or hidden from view or both  all landscape lighting should be placed where beams are directed away from pedestrians vision cones  lights mounted directly in trees should be discouraged unless means of attaching the fixture and conduit are sensitively handled to protect the plants health and ensure a pleasing appearance appropriate lighting can highlight planting and other landscape elements design guidelines  down lighting with fixtures attached to free standing poles or neighborhood buildings is advantageous when more than one 1 tree is to be lit or when a less concentrated effect is desired  although it is impossible to provide definitive standards regarding the quantity of illumination or exact placement of fixtures desired effects usually require between onehalf 05 and one 1 ambient footcandles depending on design objectives color of foliage surrounding light levels etc 84 materials and colors light fixtures are available in many materials and colors design standards  cast aluminum or cast bronze is the most durable and aesthetically pleasing material option  standard box light fixtures are prohibited  fixture fittings of cast aluminum fixtures should be stainless steel  poles and bollards for lighting should be aluminum fiberglass decorative concrete or cast iron these poles provide a narrow profile and require little maintenance depending on location and thematic considerations decorative poles may be selected design guidelines  during daylight hours lighting fixtures should blend into the landscape and appear well coordinated with other site furnishings  finishes should preferably be powder coatings that minimize maintenance  2222010 road and parking standards creating a vibrant exciting urban environment where pedestrians feel safe

on the smartcode overlay transect zone map it supplements the engineering standards and procedures for land development activities in schedule j of these land development regulations  the urban landscape is characterized by a set of interdependent elements that help create a sense of place these include thoroughfare type building type frontage type and the form and disposition of landscaping and lighting thoroughfares provide the city with moving lanes for vehicles bicycles and pedestrians and public open space  a thoroughfare is associated with a particular type of movement and is endowed with two 2 attributes movement and character the movement type of the thoroughfare refers to the number of vehicles that can move safely segment within a given time period  it is physically manifested by the number of lanes and their width by the centerline radius the curb radius and the superelevation of the pavement the character of the thoroughfare refers to its suitability as a setting for pedestrian activities and it is physically manifested by the associated frontage types as determined by location within the transect  thoroughfares can be assigned appropriately to transect zones with calibrated rightofway widths movement types design speeds number of travel lanes pavement width curb radius and verge type a in zone t4 generally sidewalks occur at the edge of the rightofway b in zones t5 and t6 sidewalks occur at the edge of the rightofway and are given the additional dimensions of the tenfoot setback in the first layer as an easement  the following assumptions govern the thoroughfares shown here a to clear sight line for drivers visibility triangles shall be required as described in specifically see table 13 b pavement widths are measured inside of curb to inside of curb c curbs and gutters may range from one 1 foot six 6 inches for city thoroughfares to two 2 feet zero 0 inches for some county thoroughfares d regular parking space widths range from seven 7 feet zero 0 inches to nine 9 feet zero 0 inches  they should be wider on higher speed thoroughfares but may be restricted by existing rightofway dimensions e right turns may be taken from the parking lane f tree spacing are twentythree 23 feet on center to match parallel parking or centered to match lot line spacing g tree planters have a minimum dimension of four 4 feet by four 4 feet  increased where possible to a four 4 foot by eight 8 foot dimension h bulbouts may be added where thoroughfare widths are wide and design speed high or where sidewalks are narrow in order to facilitate pedestrian safety  thoroughfares must evolve with the needs of the area encompassed within the smartcode overlay transect zone map as the abovedescribed area continues to develop and redevelop a thoroughfare may change in character reflecting new density or conversely a return to a historic dimension for example a continuous lawn planter may be replaced with individual tree wells for additional sidewalk space or a wide neighborhood street may be narrowed to control traffic intrusion  the accommodation of bicycles and transit requires detailed response to the existing thoroughfare condition and thus is not illustrated here specifically 52  general principles  thoroughfares are intended for use by vehicular transit bicycle and pedestrian traffic and to provide access to open spaces  thoroughfares consist of lanes for vehicles transit bicycles and public frontages the lanes may have a variety of widths for movement and parking the public frontages contribute to the character of transect zones they may include swales sidewalks curbing planters bicycle paths and street trees see tables 2 3 3a  3i 6 and 13  thoroughfares should be designed in context with the urban form and the desired speed of the transect zones they pass the public frontages that pass from one 1 transect zone to another should be adjusted accordingly  bicycles are a sustainable and viable mode of transportation and recreation within the area encompassed by smartcode overlay transect zone map bicycle use of thoroughfares should be as follows bicycles and vehicles may share use of lanes on all thoroughfares thoroughfares that have sufficient paving width to accommodate bicyclists safety should included dedicated bicycle lanes greenways waterfront walks and other civic spaces should include bicycle usage  a bicycle plan may designate an interconnected network serving bicyclists with a series of marked routes that include bicycle lanes as well as bicycle routes that give bicycles priority such as those thoroughfares which parallel major corridors or include major corridors which can be reconfigured to limit conflicts between vehicles and bicycles  pedestrian comfort should be a primary consideration of thoroughfare design and dimensions design conflicts between and among vehicular bicycle and pedestrian movement should be decided in favor of the pedestrian 53  thoroughfares  this the guidelines for thoroughfares typical thoroughfares are assembled from the vehicular lane elements that appear in table 2 3 and 3a  3i and the public frontages of table 4 and table 5 through the waiver process additional thoroughfare assemblies may be proposed on a plat or site plan  the thoroughfare network should be designed to prioritize connectivity defining blocks not exceeding the maximum block perimeter for the affected transect zone the block perimeter shall be measured as the sum of lot frontage lines thoroughfare closing shall not be allowed  instead traffic calming designs should be deployed to control traffic volume and speeding notwithstanding thoroughfare closings may be deployed to discourage access to certain institutionalcivic uses eg community blood banks in order to protect the general health safety and welfare  all thoroughfares should terminate at other thoroughfares to form a network culdesacs should be allowed only when supported by natural site conditions thoroughfares that provide view corridors shall not be vacated  in t5 and t6 zones public and private frontages should be coordinated with a single paving and landscape design as provided in tables 4 5 and 6 54  connections plan map  in palm beach county v wright 641 so2d 50 fla sct 1994 the florida supreme court approved the validity of a thoroughfare map designating for planning purposes roads that are likely to be widened and future roads that are to be built like the palm beach county thoroughfare map the connections plan map referenced herein is intended to a protect existing and future rightsofway including pedestrian passages from building encroachments and to preserve and acquire existing and future rightsofway  b place property owners on notice as to the necessity and location of future thoroughfares  and c allow land developers adequate time to plan their developments with proper thoroughfare interfacing requirements  the connections plan map is displayed in map number 2 and shows the general locations for thoroughfares including pedestrian passages consistent with the standards requirements and guidelines established herein the exact thoroughfare locations thoroughfare types and widths have not been finally determined and shall be determined on a casebycase basis so as to allow flexibility to ameliorate any hardships  the city may require the dedication of easements and rightsofway in order to implement the connections plan map the city may allow a thoroughfare to be initially developed as a private driveway and when circumstances are appropriate to be converted into a public rightofway 55  public frontages  public frontage should be designed as shown in tables 4 and 5 and allocated within transect zones as specified in table 11  within the public frontages the arrangement of street trees and street lights should be as provided in tables 4 and 5  the public frontage in transect zones t4 t5 t6 should include trees planted in a regularly spaced alle of single or alternated species with shade canopies of a height that at maturity clears the first story the introduced landscape should primarily be of a durable species tolerant of soil compaction 56  vision clearance  intent it is the intent of these regulations to provide protection from traffic hazards at intersections for motorized vehicles and their passengers and for cyclists and pedestrians including small children  material impediment to visibility construed given the above intent the phrase material impediments to visibility as used here is to be construed as any material obstruction to visibility which would result in concealment of a child over two and onehalf 212 feet in height approaching an intersection or would conceal an approaching motorized vehicle or cyclist from such a child in determinations as to whether or not there is a material impediment to visibility the speed direction and duration of movement to point of potential collision or contact shall be considered  adjacent to thoroughfares nothing shall be erected placed planted or allowed to grow in such a manner as to form a material impediment to visibility
