department strongly recommends that all new retrofit installations of reducedpressureprinciple devices and doublecheckvalve backflow preventers include the installation of strainers located immediately upstream of the backflow device the installation of strainers will preclude the fouling of backflow devices due to both foreseen and unforeseen circumstances occurring to the water supply system such as water main repairs water main breaks fires periodic cleaning and flushing of mains etc these occurrences may stir up debris within the water main that will cause fouling of backflow

accountant investment management services  printing services involving extensive writing editing or art work management of municipality owned property  and computer software or programming services for customized programs or services involved in substantial modification and customizing of prepackaged software b emergency purchases pursuant to  103 subdivision 4 of the general municipal law due to the nature of this exception these goods or services must be purchased immediately and a delay in order to seek alternate proposals may threaten the life health safety or welfare of the residents this does not preclude alternate proposals if time permits c purchases of surplus and secondhand goods if alternate proposals are required the village is precluded from purchasing surplus and secondhand goods at auctions or advertised sources where the best prices are usually obtained it is also difficult to try to compare prices of used goods and a lower price may indicate an older product d goods and services under $250 the time and documentation required to purchase policy may be more costly than the item itself and would therefore not be in the best interests of the taxpayer in addition it is not likely that such de minimis contracts would be awarded based on favoritism e purchase orders goods and services valued at $250 or above will be contracted for use of a purchase order a blanket purchase order will be issued for no more than $500  a2063 palmyra code  dl1 a ll no adoption date subject disposition 12004 1152004 streets and sidewalks amendment ch 163 22004
