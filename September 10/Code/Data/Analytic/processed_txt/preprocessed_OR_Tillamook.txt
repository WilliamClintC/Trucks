following findings of fact a the secondary effects of the activities defined and regulated in this chapter are detrimental to the public health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city and therefore these activities must be regulated b regulation of the adult entertainment industry is necessary because in the absence of the regulation significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred this history of criminal activity in the adult entertainment industry has included prostitution illegal employment of minors narcotics and alcoholic beverage law violations breaches of the peace tax evasion and the presence within the industry of individuals with hidden ownership interests and outstanding arrest warrants c proximity between entertainers and patrons during adult entertainment performances can facilitate sexual contact prostitution and related crimes concerns about crime and public sexual activity are legitimate and compelling concerns of the city which demand reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments in order to protect the public health safety and general welfare d the activities described in divisions b and c of this section occur in the absence of regulation regardless of whether the adult entertainment is presented in conjunction with the sale of alcoholic beverages e it is necessary to license entertainers in the adult entertainment industry to prevent the exploitation of minors  to ensure that each entertainer is an adult  and to ensure that the entertainers have not assumed a false name which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible f it is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of establishments offering adult entertainment at such times as the establishments are offering adult entertainment so that there will at all necessary times be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the adult entertainment establishment including the actions of patrons entertainers and other employees g the license fees required in this chapter are necessary as nominal fees imposed as necessary regulatory measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the city in regulating the adult entertainment industry h hidden ownership interests for the purposes of skimming profits and avoiding the payment of taxes have historically occurred in the adult entertainment industry in the absence of regulation these hidden ownership interests have historically been held by organized and white collar crime elements in order for the city to effectively protect the public health safety morals and general welfare of its citizens and effectively allocate its law enforcement resources it is important that the city be fully apprised of the actual ownership of adult entertainment establishments and identities and backgrounds of persons responsible for management and control of the adult entertainment establishment i it is not the intent of this chapter to suppress or censor any expressive activities protected by the adult businesses 33 first amendment of the united states constitution or of the state constitution but rather to enact time place and manner regulations which address the compelling interests of the city in mitigating the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments j in an undercover

charged for acts occurring while the officers were inside deja vu police officers repeatedly observed managers ignoring criminal law violations committed inside deja vu within a short distance from

request a variance to the riparian setback as a replacement to of this development code granting of a variance requires findings that 1 the proposed development represents a reasonable and legal use of the lot or parcel considering the zoning district requirements  and 2 strict adherence to the riparianwetland area setback and other applicable standards would effectively preclude a use of the parcel that could be reasonably expected to occur in similarly zoned parcels  and 3 the property owner would be precluded a substantial property right enjoyed by the majority of landowners in the vicinity and has exhausted all other options available under this relieve the hardship  and 4 the variance is the minimum necessary to retain a use of the property and to afford relief considering the potential for increased flood and erosion hazard and potential adverse impacts on native vegetation fish and wildlife habitat and water quality  and 5 granting the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or be injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood of the premises and no significant adverse impacts on water quality erosion or slope stability will

areas  g to ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions 2 findings of fact the flood hazard areas of tillamook city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare a these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately flood proofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss b methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this ordinance includes methods and provisions for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at

tillamook city planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this  1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  rev

records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal insurance administration upon request 2 conditions for variances a generally the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing 7d1 c111 been fully considered as the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set forth in this section c variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief e variances shall only be issued upon 1 a showing of good and sufficient cause  2 a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  3 a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense rev uh 174 create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare g variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of flood proofing than water tight or dry flood proofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with
