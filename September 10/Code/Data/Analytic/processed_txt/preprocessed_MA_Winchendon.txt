values protected by this bylaw in accordance to the riverfront area the commission will presume that this area is important to all the resource area values unless demonstrated otherwise and no permit will be issued unless the applicant having met all applicable requirements of this bylaw has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that 1 there is no practicable alternative to the proposed activities with less adverse effects and that 2 such activities including proposed mitigation measures will have no significant adverse impact on the areas and values protected by this bylaw the commission shall regard the overall project and alternatives in which are practicable and reasonable and capable of being done after taking into consideration the proposed property use overall project purpose eg residential institutional commercial or industrial logistics existing technology costs for the alternatives and overall project costs to prevent a loss of resource areas and minimize alteration  the commission shall require applicants to avoid alteration wherever feasible  to minimize alteration and where alteration is unavoidable the commission will bylaws of the town of winchendon  authorize or require replication of wetlands these replication areas must have professional design specific plans and proper safeguards there must be professional monitoring and reporting to ensure its success the commission may require a wildlife habitat study of a proposed project area at the expense of the applicant regardless of the location of the resource area the decision shall be based on vital information of actual or possible presence of rare plant or animal species in the area the work shall be done by someone who meets the qualifications listed in the wildlife habitat section of the wetlands protection act regulations 310 cmr 1060 the commission will accept all areas meeting the definition of vernal pools see definitions under this bylaw to include adjacent areas

below these setbacks are the minimum and may be extended further if deemed necessary for the protections of the interests of the bylaw by the commission example seasonal high water line topography industrial verses residential the setbacks shall be as follows a 0foot setback for wetlanddependent structures drain outfalls weirs etc fences and structures necessary for upland access where reasonable alternative access is unavailable b 50foot setback of undisturbed natural vegetation c 75foot setback of no buildstructure zone bylaws of the town of winchendon  when in the opinion of the commission compliance with these setbacks will result in greater harm to the interests of this bylaw or that no harm would be done to the interests of this bylaw by the proposed action eg nonmotorized boat shed mooring the commission would then waiver by degree these setbacks the conservation commission is permitted to grant such waivers preexisting activities or structures not meeting the setbacks set forth prior to this law need not be discontinued or removed but are deemed to be nonconforming no new activity shall be commenced and no new structure shall be located closer to the edge of wetlands or vernal pools than this bylaw allows unless such activity or structure will not affect the interests protected by the bylaw no more adversely than the existing activity or structure  erosion and sedimentation control where activities are proposed within the buffer zone erosion and sedimentation barriers and other erosion controls as necessary shall be installed between the area of activity and the wetlands or vernal pool to prevent sediment into said areas similarly the same erosion controls shall be installed when activities outside the buffer zone create a significant

amendment 121 1310 planning board associate member 121 town of winchendon zoning bylaw adopted  last amended on  6 article 1 introduction  11 purpose and spirit of the bylaw in the early years of the united states the perception of the vast spaces of the country allowed landowners in their log cabins remote from civilization to do pretty much as they pleased with their properties and zoning was not of much interest however the desire to have access to the goods services and functions of civilization eg like water sewage healthcare and so forth overcame the desire for unfettered freedom as long as individual pursuit of goods services and functions did not impact their neighbors any more than their neighbors pursuit all was relatively copasetic people cooperated with their neighbors before building or planting for the sake of community unfortunately over time people began to abuse the cooperative spirit for individual gain polluting factories were constructed in the middle of dense urban residential area zoning was first enacted to counteract the health implications of these incompatible landuses in 19th century england zoning has thus been inclined to regulate landuses rather than the direct cause of the pollution or impact in more recent times the sophistication of technology has enabled zoning to directly manage the actual impacts and performance of a given landowner or user upon hisher neighbors recognizing this as more directly what is objectionable to the neighborhood one could imagine for instance a beautiful clock factory building that would not pollute or adversely affect its neighbors and might in fact employ much of the neighborhood within walking distance increasing both land appeal and value but zoning by landuse alone would probably disallow this type of admittedlyrare arrangement mission this bylaw is thus enacted to encourage the most appropriate use and performance of land throughout the town to eliminate or mitigate the adverse impacts of this use to conserve the value of land and buildings to preserve and protect lakes streams wetlands aquifers watersheds and other environmental resources of the town to provide careful recognition of variable soil conditions throughout the town to prevent overcrowding of land to preserve the historical character of the town and to preserve and increase amenities so that all citizens shall have access to the fruits of living in winchendon and to a quality of life that they choose without preventing their neighbors from doing the same  it is the intention of this bylaw to encourage practices which will make winchendon a sustainable community these include practices that will contribute to the reduction of global warming discourage the generation of greenhouse gases and encourage their absorption discourage unnecessary energy use and encourage the use of renewable energy sources this bylaw is enacted with reasonable consideration for the towns unique physical characteristics and its unique suitability for particular uses with a view toward providing direction to the land development policies and proposals of the planning board including making the town of winchendon a more viable and more pleasant community in which to live work and play consistent with the objectives laid forth in the master plan for the town of winchendon including its rural character and easy access to modern amenities 12 authority this bylaw is enacted under rights of local selfgovernment granted by the massachusetts constitution and by the authority granted under of

encourages minimization of impervious surfaces protection of critical environmental resource areas and preservation of naturallyvegetated buffers any reductions in impervious cover result in reduced stormwater runoff and consequently smaller land consumption areas and lower construction costs in an effort to apply a more holistic approach to stormwater management five specific nonstructural practices called lid design criteria for better environmental site design are provided for designers that will significantly reduce the size and cost of structural practices nonstructural practices are increasingly recognized as a critical feature of effective stormwater management particularly with respect to site design in most cases nonstructural practices will need to be combined with structural practices to meet stormwater requirements the key benefit of nonstructural practices is that they can reduce the generation of stormwater from the site in addition they can provide partial removal of many pollutants and contribute to groundwater recharge the five nonstructural lid design criteria are criterion 1 environmentally sensitive development criterion 2 disconnection of rooftop runoff criterion 3 disconnection of nonrooftop runoff criterion 4 stream buffers criterion 5 grass channels this section describes each of the criteria for the five groups of nonstructural practices and specifies minimum standards for their application to a site the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep will need to validate the volume reductions in order to ensure compliance with the massachusetts wetlands protection act the application of these criteria does not relieve the design engineer or reviewer from the standard of engineering practice associated with safe conveyance of stormwater runoff and good drainage design several of the stormwater criteria apply towards meeting the massachusetts stormwater policys recharge requirement the massachusetts stormwater policy currently only recognizes a volume based approach to meeting this standard recently however it has been demonstrated that disconnecting impervious area to drain over pervious areas can result in significant recharge to groundwater therefore some jurisdictions most notably the states of vermont and maryland have developed recharge criteria that credit recharge based on an area method as opposed to strictly a volume method to better understand this approach both the volume method and area method are described as follows the intent of the recharge criteria which is often denoted as rev is to maintain predeveloped groundwater recharge rates at development sites to preserve existing water table elevations winchendon lid regulations  21   thereby helping to support baseflow to streams and wetlands as well as to help augment drinking water supplies the objective of the criteria is to mimic the average annual recharge rate for the prevailing hydrologic soil groups hsg present at a development site therefore the recharge volume can be determined as a function of annual predevelopment recharge for a given soil group average annual rainfall volume and amount of impervious cover at a site being a function of site impervious cover the criterion provides an incentive to engineers and developers to reduce site imperviousness the recharge can be satisfied by one of two methods or a combination of both the first is designated as the percent volume method and is based on infiltrating the recharge volume using one or more of the approved structural practices such as infiltration trench infiltration basins or drywells the second method is designated as the percent area method and is based on draining runoff from some or all of a site impervious area or more of the approved nonstructural practices based on this approach the percent volume method is as follows rev   fai12 where rev   recharge volume acrefeet f   recharge factor in inches see below a   site area in acres i

requirement the following applies 1 calculate both the rev and rea for the site  2 the site impervious area draining to an approved nonstructural practice is subtracted from the rea calculation from step 1 above  3 the remaining rea is divided by the original rea to calculate a prorated percentage that needs to be met by the percent volume method  4 the prorated percent is multiplied by the original rev to calculate a new rev that must be met by an approved structural practices with this basic understanding of how the recharge requirement can be met on a project it is now appropriate to review the suite of lid design criteria that can meet both recharge water quality and in a few cases some of the water quantity controls as well winchendon lid regulations  23   criterion no 1 environmentally sensitive development this practice is utilized when a group of environmental site design techniques are applied to lower density or rural residential development the criterion eliminates the need for structural practices to treat both the rev and water quality and can reduce required volumes for peak control of the 2year 10year and 100year storms minimum standards the rev and water quality requirements are completely met without the use of structural practices in certain low density less than 1 dwelling unit per acre residential developments when the following conditions are met  the total impervious cover footprint is less than 15 % of lot area   a minimum of 25% of the site is protected in natural conservation areas   rooftop runoff is disconnected in accordance with the specifications outlined under criterion 2   grass channels are used to convey runoff versus curb and gutter for roads andor driveways with no specific constraints on water quality volume velocity or minimum retention time  and  stream buffers are incorporated into the site design on both perennial and intermittent streams where applicable the designer must still address

infiltrate into the soil or flow over it with sufficient time and velocity to allow for filtering the standard is typically met by grading the site to promote overland flow channels or by providing bioretention1 areas either onlot or in common areas if a rooftop is adequately disconnected the disconnected impervious area can be deducted from total impervious cover therefore reducing water quality volume requirements in addition disconnected rooftops can be used to meet the recharge requirement as a nonstructural practice under the percent area method restrictions on application of the criterion the rooftop disconnection criterion is subject to the following restrictions  disconnection must be designed to adequately address the issue of basement seepage   the contributing length of rooftop to a discharge location shall be 75 feet or less   the rooftop contributing area to any one discharge location cannot exceed 1000 ft2   the length of the disconnection shall be equal to or greater than the contributing rooftop length   disconnections will only be allowed for residential lot sizes greater than 6000 sq feet    the entire vegetative disconnection shall be on a slope less than or equal to 50%   where provided downspouts must be at least 10 feet away from the nearest impervious surface to discourage reconnection to the drainage network   where a gutterdownspout system is not used the rooftop runoff must drain as either sheetflow from the structure or drain to a subsurface drain field that is not directly connected to the drainage network   disconnections shall be used on relatively permeable soils hsgs a and b  therefore no soil evaluation is required   in less permeable soils hsgs c and d the water table depth and permeability shall be evaluated by a responsible professional engineer to determine if a spreading device is needed to provide sheetflow over grass surfaces in some cases dry wells see figure 2 french drains or other temporary underground storage devices may be needed to compensate for a poor infiltration capability   for those rooftops draining directly to a stream buffer one can meet either the rooftop disconnection criterion or the stream buffer criterion criterion 3 not both  and 1 bioretention systems also referred to as rain gardens or biofilters are socalled low impact development stormwater management systems that manage and treat stormwater runoff using a conditioned planting soil bed and planting materials to filter runoff stored within a shallow depression the method combines physical filtering and adsorption with biogeochemical processes to remove pollutants the system consists of an inflow component a pretreatment element an overflow structure a shallow ponding area less than 9 deep a surface organic layer of mulch a planting soil bed plant materials and an underdrain system to convey treated runoff to a downstream facility winchendon lid regulations  26    to utilize rooftop

it to pervious areas where it is either infiltrated into the soil or filtered by overland flow this criterion can be satisfied by grading the site to promote overland vegetative filtering these disconnected areas can be subtracted from the site impervious area when computing the water quality treatment volume in addition disconnected surface impervious cover can be used to meet the recharge requirement as a nonstructural practice under the percent area method restrictions on application of the criterion the criterion is subject to the following restrictions  the maximum contributing impervious flow path length shall be 75 feet   runoff cannot come from a designated hotspot land use   the length of the disconnection must be equal to or greater than the contributing length   the entire vegetative disconnection shall be on a slope less than or equal to 50%   the surface impervious area to any one discharge location cannot exceed 1000 ft2   disconnections shall be used on

engineer to determine if a spreading device such as a french drain gravel trench or other temporary storage device is needed to compensate for poor infiltration capability  and  for those areas draining directly to a wetlands or stream buffer only the nonrooftop disconnection criterion or the stream buffer criterion can be used not both winchendon lid regulations  29   criterion no 4 stream buffer these standards apply to treat stormwater runoff by a stream buffer effective treatment constitutes capturing runoff from pervious and impervious areas adjacent to a stream buffer and treating runoff overland flow in a natural vegetative or forested buffer the use of a filter strip is also recommended to treat overland flow in the green space of a development site see figure 4 the standards include  the impervious area draining by sheet flow to a stream buffer is subtracted from the sites initial impervious area in the water quality calculation  the impervious area draining to stream buffer contributes to the recharge requirement rev under the percent area method restrictions on application of the criterion the criterion is subject to the following conditions  the minimum stream buffer width ie perpendicular to the stream flow path shall be 50 feet as measured from the bank elevation of a stream or the boundary of a wetland   the maximum contributing path shall be 150 feet for pervious surfaces and 75 feet for impervious surfaces   the average contributing overland slope to and across the stream buffer shall be less than or equal to 50%   runoff shall enter the stream buffer as sheet flow a level spreading device shall be utilized where local site conditions prevent sheet flow from being maintained   the criterion is not applicable if rooftop or nonrooftop disconnection is already provided ie no double counting  and  stream buffers shall remain ungraded and uncompacted and the overstory and understory vegetation shall be maintained in a natural condition winchendon lid regulations  30   figure 4 example of application of stream buffer criterion criterion no 5 grass channel winchendon lid regulations  31   open grass channels may be used to reduce the volume of runoff and pollutants during smaller storms ie 10 inches and less use of a grass channel will automatically meet the minimum recharge rev requirement under the percent area method

storage volumes can be achieved when many criteria are combined together eg disconnecting rooftops and utilizing grass channel for drainage design however criteria cannot be claimed twice for an identical area of the site eg claiming credit for stream buffers and disconnecting rooftops over the same site area draining to the same location other strategies to reduce impervious cover site planning practices that reduce the creation of impervious area in new residential and commercial developments and therefore reduce the water quality requirements for the site should be encouraged whenever feasible2 examples of progressive site design practices that minimize the creation of impervious cover include  narrower residential road sections   shorter road lengths   smaller turnarounds and culdesac radii   permeable spillover parking areas these areas should be valued as 50% impervious unless designed specifically for infiltration   smaller parking demand ratios   smaller parking stalls for a percentage of lots   angled one way parking   cluster subdivisions   smaller front yard setbacks   shared parking and driveways  and  more creatively designed pedestrian networks where these techniques are employed it may be possible to reduce stormwater storage volumes for example since the water quality treatment volume is directly based on impervious cover a reduction in impervious cover reduces required storage for 2year 10year and 100year management the designer can compute curve numbers cns based on the actual measured impervious area at a site using the following equation adopted from tr55 1986 98 i + cn p   cn where i   percent impervious area at the site p   percent pervious area at the site 2 the reader is referred to the following two references for a more

pervious overflow parking spaces and use of vegetated stormwater practices such as filter strips and bioretention areas though not all land use types and developments are amenable to every approach

building sites because of its location its accessibility the relative ease of development and viewscapes both from and to the property 2 land that may return an economic benefit to its owner should probably be kept in private hands subject to an appropriate easement rather than being transferred to the town or a conservation entity for whom it will have little value 3 open space should be dedicated to its highest and best use within the confines of its being kept undeveloped this may be agriculture land well suited for agricultural purposes should probably be included in the open space land that was once tillage or pasture land but has been allowed to revert to woods should be considered for preservation the question of suitability of land for agricultural purposes may be referred to the winchendon agricultural commission for its opinion 4 it may be advantageous to include protected open space and developable land in a single parcel if such a combined parcel will have greater value for agricultural or commercial recreational uses a community center combined with protected open recreational space to be owned by a homeowners association will be considered the addition of protected open space to an individual house lot simply to produce a larger lot for strictly residential purposes will not be allowed 5 the availability of access to open space will be a consideration
