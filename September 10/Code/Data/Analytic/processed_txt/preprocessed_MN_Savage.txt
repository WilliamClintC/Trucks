events sporting events with musical components art festivals and student fundraisers on property owned or leased by the school or used pursuant to a written agreement with the city a permit

without any corresponding benefit to the community 2 the city and other governmental agencies acting within the scope of their functions sponsor many public assemblies payment of permit fees for each city or other governmental agency sponsored event would adversely impact the events and would represent an internal transfer of public monies for no justifiable reason b exemptions from permitfees for

the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city c wetlands overlay district wetlands and public waters help maintain water quality  of 30 serve to reduce flooding and erosion act as sources of food and habitat for a variety of fish and wildlife and are an integral part of the community s natural landscape wetlands provide the aesthetic benefits of open space and can be used to provide a natural separation of land uses it is the intent of this overlay district to establish a policy of sound stewardship of regulations which conserve protect enhance and result in the no net loss of

covered by this outlined in this precedence over minnesota rules as amended in situations where the city more restrictive than minnesota rules as amended b purpose through the adoption of this the city shall promote the general health safety and welfare of its residents by both conserving and protecting wetlands and requiring sound management practices as provided for in minnesota rules  the intent of this to avoid alteration and destruction of wetlands by implementation of this the city seeks to accomplish the following 1 balance the need to preserve and protect natural resources and systems with both the rights of private property owners and the need to support the efficient use of land within the city 2 promote water quality by maintaining the ability of wetlands to recharge ground water and receive the discharge of ground water to prevent soil erosion and to retain sediment nutrients and toxicants in wetland buffer strip areas before it discharges into community wetlands lakes and streams thus avoiding the contamination and eutrophication of these water features  3 reduce human disturbances to wetlands by providing a visual and physical transition from surrounding yards  and 4 provide wildlife habitat and thereby support the maintenance of diversity of both plant and animal species within the city c definitions the following definitions shall apply unless the

during the development review process wetland preserve preserve wetlands have an exceptional vegetative diversity and integrity function based on the results ofmnram they typically have an undisturbed plant community or a plant community that is sufficiently recovered from past disturbances such that it closely represents preeuropean settlement conditions the wetlands contain an abundance of different plant species with dominance evenly spread among several species they will contain very few nonnative species and they may have or previously had rare threatened or endangered plant species invasive or exotic plant species are either absent or limited to small areas where some disturbance has occurred these wetlands exhibit no evidence of significant man induced water level fluctuation wetlands manage one manage one wetlands have a high vegetative diversity and integrity function based on the results ofmnram and are still generally in their natural state they tend to show less evidence of adverse effects of surrounding land uses exotic and invasive plant species may be present and species dominance may not be evenly distributed among several species there tends to be little evidence of water level fluctuation due to storms and their shorelines are stable with little evidence of erosion they show little if any evidence of human influences resulting in higher levels of species diversity wildlife habitat and ecological stability wetlands manage two manage two wetlands have a moderate vegetative diversity and integrity function based on the results of mnram they have a slightly higher number of native noninvasive plant species present than low quality wetlands often with small pockets of indigenous species within larger areas dominated by non native invasive exotic or weed species their relatively greater species diversity results in slightly better wildlife habitat they exhibit evidence of relatively less fluctuation in water level in response to storms and less evidence of shoreline erosion than low quality wetlands they also exhibit relatively less evidence of human influences and therefore tend to be of a higher aesthetic quality than low quality wetlands wetlands manage three manage three wetlands have a low vegetative diversity and integrity functions based on mnram and have been substantially altered by activities such as agricultural or urban development that caused overnitrification soil erosion sedimentation and or water quality degradation as a result of these factors these wetlands exhibit low levels of vegetation diversity  overcrowding and dominance of invasive or nonnative species such as reed canary grass cattails and purple loosestrife  and a related reduction in the quality of wildlife habitat these wetlands may also tend to exhibit extreme water level fluctuations in response to  of 30 rain events and show evidence of shoreline erosion these wetlands do provide for water quality and serve an important role

23 11  passed 9 4 2001  passed 4 7 2008  passed 10 17 11 penalty see   152 471 dynamic displays a studies show that there is a correlation between dynamic displays on signs and the distraction of highway drivers distraction can lead to traffic accidents drivers can be distracted not only by a changing message but also by knowing that the sign has a changing message drivers may watch a sign waiting for the next change to occur drivers are also distracted by messages that do not tell the full story in one look people have a natural desire to see the end of the story and will continue to look at the sign in order to wait for the end additionally drivers are more distracted by special effects used to change the message such as fade ins and fade outs finally drivers are generally more distracted by messages that are too small to be clearly seen or that contain more than a simple message time and temperature signs appear to be an exception to these concerns because the messages are short easily absorbed and become inaccurate without frequent changes b despite these public safety concerns there is merit to allowing new technologies to  of 24 easily update messages except as prohibited by state or federal law sign owners should have the opportunity to use these technologies with certain restrictions the restrictions are intended to minimize potential driver distraction and to minimize proliferation in residential districts where signs can adversely impact residential character c local spacing requirements could interfere with the equal opportunity to use such technologies and are not included without those requirements however there is the potential for numerous dynamic displays to exist along any roadway if more than one dynamic display can be seen from a given location on a road the minimum display time becomes critical if the display time is too short a driver could be subjected to a view that appears to have constant movement this impact would obviously be compounded in a corridor with multiple signs if dynamic displays become pervasive and there are no meaningful limitations on each signs ability to change frequently drivers may be subjected to an unsafe degree of distraction and sensory overload therefore a longer display time is appropriate d a constant message is typically needed on a sign so that the public can use it to identify and find an intended destination changing messages detract from this wayfinding purpose and could adversely affect driving conduct second lane changes stops or turns which could result in traffic accidents accordingly dynamic displays generally should not be allowed to occupy the entire copy and graphic area of a sign e in conclusion the city finds that dynamic displays should be allowed on signs but with significant controls to minimize their proliferation and their potential threats to public safety 1 regulations dynamic displays on signs are allowed subject to the following conditions a dynamic displays are allowed only on advertisingbillboardnon accessory signs monument signs and pylon signs dynamic displays may occupy no more than 40% of the actual copy and graphic area the remainder of the sign must not have the capability to have dynamic displays even if not used only one contiguous dynamic display area is allowed on a sign face b a dynamic display may not
