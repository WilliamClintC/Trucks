and off roadways typically have the greatest impact on traffic flow and crash frequency therefore where driveways are to be located in a segment defined in adopted corridor or other plans or studies as having a high crash rate or significant traffic congestiondelays or where leftturn access is available means of access the zoning administrator or planning commission may require driveway design and signing which discourages certain turning movements where driveways are intended to control specific left andor rightturn ingress and egress the designs shown in figure 143 shall apply similar

taper deceleration lane andor leftturn bypass lane may be required 2 where site frontage allows and a rightturn lane is warranted a taper between 50 and 225 feet may be required see example in figure 144a 3 where the amount of frontage precludes the construction of a deceleration lane and taper combination entirely within the property lines of a parcel a request shall be made to the adjacent owner of the parcel to allow the installation of a rightturn bay and taper which extends beyond the property line if permission cannot be obtained from the adjacent property owner for an extension onto that parcel a taper of at least 75 feet shall be constructed as shown in figure 144b 4 a continuous rightturn lane as shown in figure 144c may be required where driveway spacing requirements restrict the use of consecutive turn bays and tapers and a traffic engineer concludes it can be constructed without being used as a  for driveways located along streets without an exclusive leftturn lane a bypass lane may be required such a lane shall be designed to the standards in the michigan department of transportation traffic and safety notes #77 and as shown in figure 144d c acceleration lanes 1

requirements charter township of marquette zoning  article 19 performance requirements  purpose traditionally zoning ordinances have been designed to minimize land use conflicts by attempting to group compatible land uses together these land use groups are then relegated to districts which have been prearranged into patterns intended to minimize the differences between adjacent districts the districting system has not always worked efficiently in practice because when zoning ordinances are formulated it is impossible to foresee all future development patterns the desires of property owners also often do not conform to district regulations and conflicts invariably arise therefore the purpose of this to not only specify the schedule of district regulations but also to apply minimum performance standards applicable for each individual situation performance requirements are intended to minimize the possible adverse impacts of new developments on adjacent land uses the requirements will vary depending on a number of factors including the zoning district in which the parcel is located the natural physical limitations of the site the type and intensity of the proposed land use the intensity of existing adjacent land use the zoning district of adjacent land the existing land use andor the zoning district across the street and the size of the parcels  definitions terms used in the text and tables of this defined in definitions  performance standards the schedule of district regulations and minimum performance standards for each of the eight 8 specific zoning districts are designated on the nomographs in of this contain the minimum standards applicable to the various uses permitted within each of the zoning districts the nomographs summarize many requirements governing allowable land uses within each zoning district different zoning districts provide varying requirements depending upon the type of land use proposed the following formulas are to be utilized to assist

reduced the site enlarged or a different larger site sought article 19  performance requirements charter township of marquette zoning   bufferyards a purpose and intent a bufferyard is a designated strip of land unit of yard or open area of plantings surrounding a land use which screens or blocks vision noise pollutants or other negative byproducts associated with that use in the case of very intense land uses abutting considerably less intense uses the addition of structural components such as berms fences or walls may also be a part of a required bufferyard bufferyards provide visual barriers which block out the glare of lights signs and other visual nuisances and in addition natural or planted bufferyards function in two ways to block noise distance and plant material reduce the intensity of noise and wooded areas introduce the background sounds of trees wind birds and while these background noises do not actually reduce noise they make it less noticeable and therefore less annoying bufferyards shield the source of the noise from view which tends to distract attention from the nuisance and thereby minimizes its perceived impact they may also serve as a protective or safety barrier insofar as they block physical passage heavily planted bufferyards also reduce air pollution dust dirt and litter however the ultimate purpose of the bufferyard is to mitigate any potentially negative impact between adjacent parcels which differ in land use intensity lui 1 bufferyards and land use intensity lui principal uses permitted in districts classifies all land uses permitted within a district according to their type and degree of land use intensity lui or impact which they may impose on the adjacent land use accordingly all land use categories are assigned a land use intensity lui number ranging from i  vi greater land use intensities are reflected by the higher lui numbers and are typically the result of increased onsite activities due to additional vehicular andor pedestrian traffic along with the impact of associated noise congestion glare larger buildings and increased storm water runoff while the specific zoning district controls whether a land use is permitted to locate within that district the land use intensity lui number is the basis for determining the type and extent of the required bufferyard therefore by utilizing a combination of distancespace natural features landscape manipulation berms fences or walls the required bufferyard is designed to create the necessary screening between varying land use intensities lui and to establish a transitional land use intensitygradient between existing altered expanded proposed or vacant land uses on adjacent parcels b preservation of existing woodlands and vegetative cover marquette township has been endowed with beautiful woodlands and forests along with native and naturalized vegetative cover therefore it is strongly recommended and encouraged that these natural areas be preserved and any preconstruction onsite clearing and land balance be very limited in scope or completely discouraged until a detailed inventory of onsite natural features including site topography can first be identified article 19  performance requirements charter township of marquette zoning   bufferyards  cont in many instances natural woodlands and existing vegetative cover is very desirable to retain as they are already effectively buffering adjacent areas and being native to the area can be expected to thrive with little or lowmaintenance if left in their natural state preservation of the existing tree and plant materials may be utilized to fulfill a part or all of the bufferyard requirements as outlined in this  tree preservation approximately 9095% of tree root systems are in the top 3 feet of soil with more than 50% within the top foot root zones typically extend 2 to 3 times the distance from the tree trunk to the tips of the branches and this area should also be protected from any onsite preconstruction activities maintaining positive drainage away from existing trees and protecting roots from drainage and compaction are also essential in preserving existing trees c location of bufferyards bufferyards create screening between differing land use intensities adjacent with each other and generally are to be located along the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel and extend to the lot or parcel boundary line bufferyards shall not extend into nor be located on any part of an existing or future proposed road or dedicated public or private street rightofway it is recognized however that the specific bufferyards as outlined within this not always fit the variety of onsite scenarios which may exist due to variations in terrain along with site specific limitations utilization of a natural bufferyard or by choosing one or a combination of the several options af as shown in table iii provides the flexibility to make cost tradeoffs in deciding which option is best depending on the size of the parcel flexibility may become extremely relevant a narrow bufferyard can impose a considerable developmental constraint on a small site however on a large parcel very little buildable land will be lost the zoning administrator andor the planning commission are therefore authorized to address unforeseen and unique onsite situations and to approve the appropriate bufferyard required in accordance with the spirit and intent of this ordinance fences berms retaining walls plantings andor hedges shall be located on the property burdened with the bufferyard requirement unless there is a written agreement to the contrary with the adjacent land owners and recorded in accordance with the requirements set forth in f all required bufferyards shall be located as close as possible to the property lines consistent with future maintenance requirements when mixed onsite land use intensities lui are proposed as in a planned unit development pud a
