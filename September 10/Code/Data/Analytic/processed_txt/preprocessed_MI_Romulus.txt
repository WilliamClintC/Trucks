procuring construction if the following conditions apply a a complete adequate and realistic specification or purchase description is available  b two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete effectively for the business  and c the procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the basis of price if

reasonable in granting a variance the zoning board of appeals shall state the grounds and findings upon which it justifies granting the variance a permitted signage could not be easily seen bypassing

conforming sign would obstruct the vision of motorists or otherwise endanger the health or safety of passersby f variance from certain sign regulations would be offset by increased building setback increased landscaping or other such enhancements so that the net effect is an improvement in appearance of the parcel compared to the result that would be otherwise achieved with construction of a conforming sign g a sign which exceeds the permitted height or area standards of this chapter would be more appropriate in scale because of the large size or frontage of the parcel or building c
