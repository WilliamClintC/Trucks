excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses including but not limited to the construction of dwelling units commercial buildings and industrial plants the building of roads and highways the modification of stream channels and drainageways and the creation of recreational facilities  2 the washing blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles  3 soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies washedout fills and embankments  4 sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers streams lakes wetlands and reservoirs  5 sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds destroys fish and other desirable aquatic life and is costly and difficult to remove  and 6 sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage capacity of floodplains and natural depressions resulting in increasing chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety b purpose the provisions of this chapter are intended to safeguard persons protect property prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movements of earth on land situated in the village it is the intention of this chapter that the delivery of sediment from sites affected by landdisturbing activities be limited as closely as practicable to that which would have occurred if the land had been left in its natural undisturbed state udo 200     definitions for the purposes of this chapter certain terms used herein are defined as set forth below a cubic yards means the amount of material in excavation andor fill measured by the method of average end areas b ravine means a deep steepsloped cleft or gorge in the earths surface which is caused by runoff and stream action ravines are characterized by abundant growth of trees and other plants c removal means cutting vegetation to the ground or stumps complete extraction or killing by spraying d site means a lot or parcel of land or a contiguous combination thereof where grading work is performed as a single unified operation e stream means any river creek brook branch flowage ravine or natural or manmade drainageway which has a definite bed and banks or shoreline in or into which surface or groundwater flows either perennially or intermittently f stripping means any activity which removes the vegetative surface cover including tree removal clearing and storage or removal of top soil g vacant means land on which there are no structures or only structures which are secondary to the use or maintenance of the land itself udo 200     site development permit required unless otherwise provided for by this ordinance no person shall commence or perform any clearing grading stripping excavating or filing of land

permit requirements of this chapter c erosion and sedimentation control guidelines measures taken to control soil erosion and offsite sediment runoff should be adequate to assure that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of tenyear frequency or less the following guidelines shall apply to all development activities 1 development should be related to the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible 2 natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses lakes ponds and wetlands should be left undisturbed wherever possible temporary crossings of watercourses when permitted must include appropriate stabilization measures 3 special precautions should be taken to prevent damages resultant from any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream lake pond or wetland preventive measures should reflect the sensitivity of these areas to erosion and sedimentation 4 the smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest practical time during development 5 sediment basins or traps filter barriers diversions and any other appropriate sediment or runoff control measures should be installed prior to site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing development 6 the selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion and on evaluation of the risks costs and benefits involved 7 in the design of erosion control facilities and practices aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered 8 provision should be made to accommodate the increasing runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development drainage ways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities and rates of discharge will not create additional erosion onsite or downstream 9 permanent vegetation and structures should be installed and functional as soon as practical during development 10 those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land uses should be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to development 11 all waste generated as a result of site development activity should be
