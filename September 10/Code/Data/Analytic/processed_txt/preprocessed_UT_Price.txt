boundaries along the price river meads wash and selected tributaries within the city 2 the flood hazard areas of price city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 3 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1

seat of carbon county is the largest city in the county and is located in the price river valley of the colorado plateau region of utah it is believed that price was named after lds bishop william price of goshen utah who explored the region in 1869 the area was originally a part of sanpete county and then was included in emery county when it was created in 1880 price was organized on  while it was still a part of emery county caleb baldwin rhoades and abraham powell trappers from salem utah were the first recorded settlers in the price river valley they arrived in october 1877 and built a cabin in the northwest corner of what is now price the two 2 returned to salem when the trapping season was over their talk aroused interest in the area among their friends and families and they soon convinced a group to join them in relocating in the price river valley however abraham powell never returned to price as he was killed by a bear on  while hunting in the nebo mountains on  caleb rhoades returned to the valley with two 2 brothers frederick empire grames and charles w grames the men helped each other build homes for their families later that year they were joined by their families and others most coming from utah county these early pioneers of price experienced much hardship food was in short supply and crops were difficult to grow because of a lack of irrigation water water had to be carried from the river in barrels and tanks an irrigation ditch to carry water to the fields was of utmost importance construction of two 2 ditches began in february 1879 when caleb rhoades and frederick grames began the project a  sterling codifiers inc  369407 community effort eventually finished the two 2 ditches but it wasnt until the price water company canal was finished in 1888 that the irrigation problem was solved the canal is still in use today the character of price changed dramatically with the completion of the railroad in 1883 price was quickly transformed from an isolated farming community to the commercial hub of castle valley the railroad was directly responsible for price becoming the retail political educational and cultural center of the area the railroad also opened up the nearby coal mines which brought thousands of foreign born nonmormon immigrants to work the mines originally these miners lived in the coal camps near the mines but price gradually assimilated many of them reflecting the ethnic diversity of the county and becoming a cultural hub as well these immigrants came from many countries but the majority was greek italian austrian and japanese this diversified population has remained today making price one of utahs most culturally complex and varied communities price has a variety of stores and businesses as well as many parks recreational facilities schools and a full service hospital price is also the home of the college of eastern utah a rapidly growing community college past expansion and future plans for ceu prehistoric museum have made it one of the best of its kind in the world the economy of price is very much tied to the coal industry and therefore has been up and down cycles  but price remains today the commercial and cultural center of castle valley price has always been and continues to be unique among utah towns source jane lyman johnson utah history encyclopedia   demographics the most recent

the downtown area is generally seen as those blocks immediately adjoining main street between heritage park 400 west and 300 east street within this area are many opportunities for urban design and community improvement including the refurbishingrestoration of building facades and the installation of streetscape elements   streetscape improvements effectively designed and constructed streetscapes on prices streets will do much to improve their look feel and effectiveness and thereby have many positive impacts on the economy and quality of life in price what is a streetscape it can be defined as a facelift  a beautification or softening of a city street it is a development project which invites pedestrian traffic by adding human elements to the harsh environment of a street designed mostly for the fast flow of vehicles it provides physical and designable characteristics that provide the setting for successful urban living streetscape designs are intended to make the communitys main street a great street a street people want to use a street which helps define the community several options exist for designing streetscapes on prices main corridors which include

from approximately heritage park at 400 west to 300 east street carries special significance to the community as its core special attention to maintaining and upgrading the appearance and feel of this area is essential to its vitality and effectiveness this section of main street along with those cross streets heading north and south for the distance of one block should be assigned the highest priority for streetscape improvement projects in price the remaining section of main street between 300 east and the us highway 6 interchange is also very important to the community especially as a business corridor although the development and design of the built environment varies from that of the downtown area attention to the quality of appearance of the streets sidewalks and landscaping can be equally beneficial to the community streetscaping can take a different form in this area but certain elements should tie into the theme of what is used in the downtown section 2 other main corridors carbon avenue and 100 north street should be considered second priority for streetscape improvements as a third priority the following streets should be considered for streetscape improvements 100 south street 300 east street 800 north street and cedar hills drive finally improvements should be planned on the streets surrounding washington park and the college of eastern utah the most important areas for improvements on all streets are near major intersections and freeway entrances 3 entryways entryway beautification is key to creating a great impression for visitors and setting the tone for the beautiful and progressive community that price is and strives even more to become beautification improvement projects at the entryways to the community can include many types

although the population has remained relatively stable over recent years needs for various types of housing have increased having a median housing value of ninety two thousand dollars $9200000 per the 2000 census the housing market in price is currently comprised largely of singlefamily detached homes the median monthly mortgage is seven hundred fifty six dollars $75600 and the median rent is four hundred nine dollars $40900 nearly sixty percent 60% of the homes in price were built prior to 1970 addressing the needs for housing the city has identified several issues including the need for an improved mix of housing options more moderate income housing options infill housing development and more quality high density housing projects   housing density and options eighty percent 80% of the housing in price currently falls within a singlefamily designation the remaining twenty percent 20% representing various types of attached or multifamily housing units provide most of the affordable housing options in the community it is the citys desire to preserve existing areas of low density housing while at the same time allowing for increased medium to high density housing needs such as student senior and other quality attached housing developments while the importance of providing affordable housing has increased in recent years the concept of providing a healthy balance of quality mid level and higher end housing is being recognized as an increasingly important goal a diversification within price city neighborhoods including a mixture of low moderate and even high income housing units is desired   sterling codifiers inc  395407  moderate income housing moderate income housing has become an increasingly imperative issue for price city in recent years economic conditions have caused housing costs in price to increase at rates higher than personal income and wages because of this imbalance many residents have been excluded from adequate housing opportunities the 2000 census points out that nearly ninety eight percent 98% based on mean values of the families living in price are within the low to moderate income levels the state of utah defines moderate income housing as housing occupied or reserved for occupancy by households with a gross household income equal to or less than eighty percent 80% of the median gross income of the metropolitan statistical area msa for households of the same size in other words moderate income housing is a function of the particular circumstances and income levels of the community rather than a type of housing in an effort to meet the needs for moderate income housing in the price community a plan was created in october 2002 describing several policies and establishing goals the price municipal corporation community affordable housing plan is designed to assist decision making with housing issues see appendix d as referenced in the ordinance codified herein on file in the city   quality high density housing in trying to meet the need for a balanced mix of housing in price a key objective is to seek and require development of high quality high density residential developments such as condominiums townhomes etc which are not geared toward meeting low or moderate income housing objectives are currently too few in number the development of projects which include quality design landscaping amenities and good maintenance should be encouraged and sought as new housing demands increase a student housing an important and continuing need for high density housing is in the realm of student housing as the student enrollment increases further needs for providing student housing locations will arise areas close in proximity to the college of eastern utah are deemed best for additional student housing development nearby accommodations reduce car trips make student life more affordable and help current singlefamily housing areas maintain their integrity b senior citizen housing seniors play an important role in the community and are a growing faction of the local population more quality senior housing developments need to be encouraged which will integrate within the singlefamily low density zones and become an asset to the community assisted living residential projects are encouraged throughout the community in facilities constructed for that purpose   infill residential development as price continues to grow residential development is encouraged to take place on the remaining developable lots found throughout the community a mix of all types of housing is
