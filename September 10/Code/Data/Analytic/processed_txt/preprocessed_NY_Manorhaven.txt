the purposes and objectives hereinafter set forth this chapter is adopted b statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 regulate uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damages  5 regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and 6 qualify for and maintain participation in the national flood insurance program c objectives the objectives of this chapter are to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions   672 reserved  721   722 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as

desirable species  c clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation  e impervious surfaces allow less water to

32019  amended 2272020 by ll no 32020  155106 purpose intent and findings the board of trustees of the village of manorhaven recognizes that the governor of the state of new york and leaders of the legislature of the state of new york have publicly stated that they plan on enacting legislation that will legalize the recreational use of marijuana within the state the board further recognizes that the current state of such proposed legislation is undecided and may include the creation of a state regulatory authority controlling businesses that will engage in the sale of recreational marijuana and further that it may include a provision under which certain counties within the state may opt in or out of such legalization given the high level of uncertainty surrounding such proposed legislation and the form which it may take the board finds that the most sensible course of action is to impose a temporary moratorium on the establishment of any use within the village that involves the sale of marijuana or marijuana products or the dispensing or distribution of medical marijuana such a moratorium will temporarily prevent the establishment of any such use until the state legislation is enacted in its final form the county of nassau takes whatever lawful action in response thereto it deems appropriate and the village has the opportunity to analyze the legal effects of such legislation and craft appropriate zoning regulations concerning such uses the board further recognizes that such measures were proposed by the governor and leaders of the legislature last year and in response the village board had imposed a temporary moratorium under local law 32019 ultimately the session of the legislature ended without the passage of substantive legislation to legalize marijuana and the villages board of trustees allowed the temporary moratorium to lapse the board finds that given the states renewed interest in the passage of such legislation another temporary moratorium would be appropriate  155107 authority the board of trustees of the village of manorhaven is authorized to adopt this article pursuant to of the new york state constitution the municipal
