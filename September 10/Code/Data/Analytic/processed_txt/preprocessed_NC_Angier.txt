are to adopt the following conservation measures 1 indoor residential use a conservation for voluntary and mandatory conservation phases 1 use dishwashers only when they are full washing dishes by hand dont let the tap run saves about 25 gallons 2 adjust water level on clothes washing machines if possible use full loads only if not adjustable 3 turn off faucets while brushing teeth etc saves about five gallons per day 4 reduce water used per flush by installing toilet tank displacement inserts a plastic jug may often be used as an alternative do not use bricks they disintegrate when soaked and the resulting grit hinders closing of flap valve 5 do not use the toilet as a trash can 6 use sink and tub stoppers to avoid wasting water 7 keep a bottle of chilled water in the refrigerator for drinking 8 find and fix leaks in toilets which can leak silently the following method can be used to see if this is occurring place a drop of food coloring in the upper tank and dont flush for 30 minutes if color appears in the bowl theres leakage 9 find and fix leaks in faucets and waterusing appliances faucets can usually be fixed cheaply and quickly by replacing washers 10 adapt plumbing with flowrestricting or other watersaving devices these are usually inexpensive and easy to install 11 learn to read your water meter so you can judge how much water you use and what difference conservation makes 12 take shorter showers and shallower baths saves about 25 gallons 13 reduce the number of toilet flushes per day each flush uses about five gallons two or three if you have watersaving toilets 14 dont use a garbage disposal 15 use nonphosphate detergent and save laundry water for lawns and plants b conservation for emergency conservation or rationing phase in addition to measures listed above 1 turn off shower while soaping up 2 use disposable eating utensils 2 outdoor residential use a conservation for normal conditions and voluntary conservation phaselawns 1 water before  am to prevent evaporation which occurs during the hottest part of the day morning is better than evening when the dampness encourages growth of fungus 2 water only when lawn shows sign of wilt grass that springs back when stepped on does not need water 3 water thoroughly not frequently long enough to soak roots a light sprinkling evaporates quickly and encourages shallow root systems water slowly to avoid runoff 4 dont let the sprinkler run any longer than necessary in an hour 600 gallons can be wasted 5 allow maximum of one inch of water per week on your lawn to measure place cake tins outside to collect rain and water from sprinklers 6 use pistolgrip nozzles on hoses to avoid waste when watering flowers and shrubs 7 aerate lawns by punching holes six inches apart this allows water to reach roots rather than run off surfaces 8 position sprinklers to water the lawn not the pavement 9 avoid watering on windy days when the wind not only blows water off target but also causes excess evaporation 10 keep sprinkler heads clean to prevent uneven watering 11 adjust hose to simulate a gentle rain sprinklers that produce a fine mist waste water  know how to turn off an automatic sprinkler system in case of rain 13 use an alarm clock or stove timer to remind you to shut off sprinklers that dont have timers b samevegetables and flower gardens 1 water deeply slowly and weekly most vegetables require moisture to a depth of six to eight inches 2 keep soil loose so water can penetrate easily 3 use mulch around plants and between rows to hold in moisture 4 keep weeds out to reduce competition for water 5 put the water where you want it and avoid evaporation by using soilsoakers or slowrunning hoses not sprinklers c sametrees and shrubs 1 water deeply using a soilsoaker 2 water only when needed check the depth of soil dryness by digging with a trowel 3 mulch to reduce evaporation a twoinch to threeinch layer of wood chips pine needles grass clippings or straw keeps the soil cool in summer 4 dig troughs around plants to catch and retain water 5 water trees growing in full sun more often than those in shade 6 do not use sprinklers apply water directly at base 7 do not fertilize during the summer fertilizing increases a plants need for water 8 postpone planting until fall or spring when there is generally less need for water 9 install trickledrip irrigation systems close to the roots of your plants by dripping water slowly the system doesnt spray water into the air use soil probes for large trees 10 water when cloudy at night or even when a light rain is falling d conservation for voluntary conservation phase in addition to measures listed in this section 1 do not allow children to play with hose or sprinklers 2

correspond to each of the base zoning districts conditional zoning cz districts allow specific uses to be established in accordance with prescribed conditions pertaining to an individual project b the purpose is to provide a voluntary alternative procedure for the rezoning of a property for a specific use a broad range of uses are permitted in the base district however there are instances where a base zoning district designation is clearly inappropriate for a property but a specific use or uses permitted under this district and subject to development requirements would be consistent with the spirit and intent of this ordinance conditional zoning districts herein established are intended to accommodate such situations this voluntary procedure is intended for firm development proposals and is neither intended nor suited for securing early zoning for tentative uses which may not be undertaken for a long period of time c just as there are nine base zoning districts there are nine

mutually approved by the town and the petitioner may be incorporated into the requirements of the district conditions and sitespecific standards imposed in a conditional zoning district shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the development and use of the site to the towns ordinances and to any officially adopted plan and those that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site c if for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to be illegal or invalid or if the applicant should fail to accept any condition it is the intent of this ordinance that the authorization of such cz district shall be null and void and of no effect and that proceedings shall be initiated by the town of angier to rezone the property to its previous zoning classification d conditional zoning districts shall be approved town board approval process outlined in chapter 11 overlay districts overlay zoning districts are established to provide land use regulations in addition to those created by the base zoning districts herein these overlay districts are implemented when necessary due to special circumstances there are two overlay zoning districts in angier that provide for the protection of special environmental features of the town as follows wpo watershed protection overlay fdpo flood damage prevention overlay  watershed protection overlay wpo the following regulations were adopted april 2005 in accordance with the state model ordinance 1 intent a the purpose of the watershed protection overlay district is to prevent significant future water quality deterioration in existing or potential future drinking water reservoirs and rivers that receive stormwater runoff form land within the town of angier protection of all water supplies within the state in accordance with minimum standards was mandated by the water supply watershed protection act passed by the general assembly in 1989 the quality of water in drinking water reservoirs and rivers can be affected by human activities including farming obstruction of highways and streets subdivision development industrial development and other land disturbing activities types of water pollutants resulting from these activities include sediment bacterial contamination heavy metals synthetic organic compounds and lowlevel radioactivity b the intent of the watershed protection overlay district is to apply a set of regulations involving land use and in some cases structural best management practices bmps that protect the watersheds by reducing the pollution from future development that enters the drinking water supplies land use management practices involve minimum lot sizes maximum allowed density and builtupon area restrictions since builtupon areas such as streets rooftops and driveways are a major source of pollution structural best management practices allow for more intensive land uses by providing for temporary detention of stormwater runoff so that pollutants may settle c the watershed protection overlay district as hereby established overlay other zoning districts established in this ordinance the new use of any land or new structure within the watershed protection overlay district shall comply with the use regulations applicable to the underlying zoning district as well as the requirements of the watershed protection overlay district d a watershed protection overlay district will be applied to the town of angiers portion of watersheds that have been classified as wsiv watersheds by the north carolina environmental management commission in its implementation of the water supply watershed protection act of 1989 in accordance with the state mandate one 1 watershed

flood damage prevention overlay fdpo the following regulations were adopted  in accordance with the state model ordinance 1 statutory authorization findings of fact purpose and objectives a statutory authorization the legislature of the state of north carolina has in of   parts 3 5 and 8 of of   and of of the north carolina general statutes delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare therefore the board of commissioners of the town of angier north carolina does ordain as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of town of angier are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this overlay to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands d objectives the objectives of this overlay are to 1 protect human life safety and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities ie water and gas mains electric telephone cable and sewer lines streets and bridges that are located in flood prone areas  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area 2 definitions definitions for the flood damage prevention overlay
