neighborhoods honeybees are critical pollinators for flowers fruits and vegetables managed colonies of bees help to increase yields and quality of a large variety of plants commonly found in backyard gardens parks and natural areas a growing interest in renewable resources has prompted more people to take up beekeeping as a way to produce their own honey beeswax pollen and other hive products that are high in nutritional value domestic strains of honeybees have been selectively bred for desirable traits so that they can be kept within populated areas and in reasonable densities without causing a nuisance if the bees are properly located and carefully managed by providing a best practices ordinance for smallscale hobby 222 editors note original  27076 industrial development was repealed at

and practices that when applied to smallscale beekeeping on residential lots protect the health safety property and welfare of the general public 1 number of hives the maximum number of hives allowed

so that all bees are forced to fly over the material to reach the colony 3 water supply every beekeeper shall ensure that a convenient and constant supply of water is provided near the hives for as long as colonies remain active outside of the hives 4 best practices the following best practices are established as standards of operation for any smallscale beekeeping operation hereafter licensed

beekeeping equipment must be kept in good and useable condition including securing unused equipment from weather theft vandalism or occupancy by swarms of bees  53561 general provisions  53561   53562

behavior by requeening colonies c administration and enforcement a beekeeping license application must be received and approved by the town before a property owner or tenant can begin beekeeping operations at a residential lot in addition beekeeping licenses must be renewed annually prior to april 1 1 neighbor notification prior to town issuance of a beekeeping license the applicantbeekeeper will be required to notify all neighbors whose properties share a common lot line with the property where beekeeping will take place 2 town inspections the community development department is authorized to make inspections during reasonable hours to investigate any complaints or to determine continued compliance with the beekeeping ordinance the department may revoke a license if there have been three or more violations of the ordinance within any sixmonth period 3 effect of compliance compliance with this section shall not be a defense to a proceeding alleging that a given bee colony is in violation of other codes or ordinances governing public nuisances or public health and safety however compliance with this section may be offered as evidence of the beekeepers efforts to abate any proven nuisance or as evidence of the beekeepers compliance with generally accepted standards of practice among smallscale hobby beekeepers in the state of wisconsin a intent it is the
