village of paddock lake amended of the village to sex offender residency in order to create terms and conditions that are consistent with those of surrounding municipalities and in order to comply with amendments to wisconsin state laws concerning placements b regulation of sex offender residency is not an issue unique to the village of paddock lake to the contrary virtually all if not literally all of the municipalities in the greater milwaukee area regulate sex offender residency and this is consistent with comparable regulations that while not universally adopted are very common throughout the state of wisconsin and nationwide c the village board now intends to revisit its regulation of sex offender residency in light of changes in state law d in revisiting the matter the village board hereby intends to and does reconsider the whole issue from its most basic premises to ensure that the regulations are tailored to the circumstances of paddock lake while preserving the sole intent to protect children from potential recidivism of convicted child sex offenders e in revisiting the matter the village board again observes the risks posed by sex offenders against children which risks are nationally recognized in such landmark legislation as the 1994 jacob wetterling crimes against children and sexually violent offender registration act  1996 megans laws  and the 2006 adam walsh child protection and safety act  and these risks are also recognized by legislation in every state in the united states of america including wisconsin f the village board finds that the data concerning child sex offenders is horrific and demonstrates the need for action including the following1 1 sex crimes are unfortunately fairly common in the united states 2 it is estimated that one in every five girls 1center for sex offender management csom statistics csom is a collaborative effort of the us department of justice office of justice programs the national institute of corrections the state justice institute and the american probation and parole association and these quoted statistics are from its fact sheet what you need to know about sex offenders and one in every seven boys are sexually abused by the time they reach adulthood 3 children are particularly vulnerable approximately 67% of all victims of reported sexual assaults are under the age of 18 and more than half of these victims are under the age of 12 4 most sexual offenses are committed by someone the victim knows  or acquaintance 5 no single factor or combination of factors can fully explain why someone offends sexually though some factors may combine to increase peoples tendency to offend these factors are  physiological sociocultural developmental and situationalcircumstantial eg having easy access to victims 6 about 12% to 24% of sex offenders will reoffend g the village board also finds these statistics of the us department of justice to be shocking and a call to action2 1 approximately 18 million adolescents in the united states have been victims of sexual assault 2 an estimated 60% of perpetrators of sexual abuse are known to the child but are not family members eg family friends babysitters child care providers neighbors h the village board is not inclined to sit idly by and do nothing to protect children within the village when these most vulnerable members of our community face these documented threats from offenders who are highly prone to reoffend if given the opportunity to do so i the village board has reviewed many studies and reports concerning recidivism of sex offenders and the 2us department of justice national sex offender public website facts and statistics effectiveness of sex offender residency restrictions3 and has been fully advised in the matter j the literature on the subject includes some studies that support the practice of imposing sex offender residency restrictions and others that are critical of the practice k the village board finds it to be significant that some of the key studies that have concluded that sex offender residency restrictions have limited effectiveness have added significant qualifications to that conclusion  eg in an evaluation of sex offender residency restrictions in michigan and missouri huebner et al 2013 the authors generally do not support sex offender residency restrictions but nevertheless find that following adoption of sex offender residency restrictions the rate of recidivism for technical violations significantly decreased for missouri sex offenders id at 9 and the number of sex offense convictions did decline in missouri id at 10 l the village board recognizes the merits mentioned in some studies of individualized consideration of the risks and benefits of residency restrictions on an offenderbyoffender basis though this assessment of risks is not a perfect science and could give rise to equal protection or other enforcement concerns  and on the local level it is important to provide clear information to those who may want to locate in the village including a map of available residency locations  and the village board finds that this desire for uniformity and clarity outweighs the desire for individualized consideration at the village level in general m in review of the residency restrictions of communities throughout kenosha county and its environs the village board finds that many of such communities have an 3these include but are not limited to recidivism of sex offenders released from prison in 199 us department of justice office of

community to take back its own while not adding an additional burden of more than its own sex offenders to its community  such burdens including neighborhood and citizen concerns and responses risks of recidivism and potential property value impacts4 n if the village of paddock lake would not have an original domicile restriction the village would have open doors for nonresident sex offender residency when other communities have closed doors inviting a substantial increase in child sex offender placements with the related adverse impacts on the health safety and welfare of the village and its residents o the village board believes that for all but the most severe offenders this risk of adverse impact declines as time passes following the date of a designated offenders offense as the offender matures recovers and reintegrates with society over time  and if this results in the offender being removed from the state registration list the offender is thereby automatically removed from the village residency restrictions  but even if state registration is required once ten years has passed from the date of the most recent offense giving rise to the designated offender designation provided it is not a class a felony against a child the village board finds it is appropriate to remove the original domicile restriction and allow such reformed citizen to move into the village of paddock lake in compliance with this ordinance  and by opening this door the village board hopes that it is establishing a precedent for its surrounding communities to open their doors as well p the village board recognizes that it cannot eliminate all risk of child sex offender reoffense and it must balance all of the competing public policies but intends by these regulations to strike the legislative balance that is appropriate for the circumstances of the village of paddock lake q it is not the intent of this ordinance to banish sex offenders from residing within the village of paddock lake and careful attention has been given to ensure that there are ample locations for sex offenders to reside within the village of 4property value impacts have been noted in numerous studies

such impact stop it now a nonprofit organization devoted to sex offender research offers this advice to those concerned about sex offenders moving into a neighborhood among others create a family safety plan  attend notification meetings  notify the police of suspicious activity  and dont wait to take action for prevention at a minimum this heightened awareness and activity burdens the families and neighbors where sex offenders are placed and collectively this burdens the village staff and resources for every designated offender placement paddock lake in compliance with the requirements of this ordinance r in reconsidering the matter having given the matter due consideration and having based its determination on the effect of the amendments on the health safety and welfare of the community and the immediate neighborhoods affected and the current and future village residents who are child sex offenders and having given due consideration to the municipal problems involved hereby determines that the following amendments to will appropriately support the public health safety and general welfare of the village of paddock lake will not be hazardous harmful noxious
