expansion of commercial and industrial properties and the general growth of pinellas county  and  whereas continued population growth will result in a reduction in the amount of land suitable for parkland and recreational purposes and consequently place an undue burden on those parklands and recreational facilities currently available for each resident of the city  and  whereas it has been found that a healthy and productive community depends in part on the availability of parkland and recreational facilities  and  whereas it is recognized that the provision of adequate parklands and recreational facilities to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of each new residential development within the city of pinellas park is just as important to proper land development as are streets water sewer and sidewalks  and  whereas because of such new population growth the city will be required to obtain additional parklands and recreational facilities  and  whereas new residential developments should share in the cost of providing those additional parklands and recreational facilities which will be necessitated by their construction  and  whereas requiring the dedication of land and facilities for parklands and recreational facilities or payment in lieu thereof by each residential developer or builder is a fair and equitable method of providing such additional parklands and recreational facilities  and  whereas in some instances the developer or builder of a residential development will provide private parkland and recreational facilities for the residents of such development and that consequently the provision for such facilities will result in a reduced need for and impact on municipal parklands and recreational facilities thus a method should be established whereby the developer or builder may be issued a credit for such private parklands and recreational facilities in proportion to that which would have been required based on the provisions contained within this of the land development  purpose the purpose of parkland dedication is to identify those minimum standards for parkland and recreational facilities which have been found to be necessary and proper for the public interest convenience health safety and welfare and to develop guidelines and establish a mechanism which will ensure that adequate parklands and

and applicability it is necessary to establish minimum requirements for facilities and space for the offstreet parking of vehicles and loading and unloading of goods in the city in order to promote the safety of pedestrians and motorists the orderly movement of people vehicles and goods and maintaining the public ways recognizing that different land uses have varying requirements for offstreet parking all use of land shall provide offstreet parking in accordance with the standards and requirements of this  10282010   general regulations the following shall apply to the development of all offstreet parking within the city of pinellas park a all parking lot development shall be designed in accordance with the citys engineering specifications on file with the engineering services department the number dimensions and marking of handicapped accessible parking spaces shall be designed in accordance with florida building b this the minimum required number of offstreet parking and loading spaces for each of the listed land uses actual parking and loading demand tends to vary for any one given use from site to site sometimes significantly the intent of the minimum standards established in this to accommodate typical weekly peak parking demand for a given use which may occur on a weekday weekend morning afternoon or evening depending upon the characteristics of the particular use given the variation in parking demand among identical land uses in different locations provides for an applicant to submit data supporting alternate parking loading or stacking requirements and authorizes the city to approve same this same process is available for uses that are not listed but that are similar to a listed use c when a developed property complies with the minimum offstreet parking requirements hereunder but consistently lacks sufficient parking to accommodate actual demand for same any application for expansion of the use or for site modification shall be evaluated as if the existing supply of offstreet parking spaces is inadequate and does not conform to the requirements of this actual parking requirement in such cases shall be based upon the demonstrated demand during typical weekly peak parking periods unless the applicant proposes mitigation acceptable to the city d the zoning director may require an applicant to perform a study or provide professionally acceptable data demonstrating that the minimum standards set forth in this number of parking loading andor stacking spaces is adequate for the proposed use when the zoning director determines that the characteristics of a proposed use may require additional spaces e for those uses not specifically assigned minimum parking requirements herein offstreet parking shall be provided on the basis of the parking requirements of comparable uses in the judgment of the zoning director the zoning director may also require a study or documentation pursuant to paragraph d above for a use that is not specifically listed in this when in the judgment of the zoning director the parking stacking andor loading characteristics of the proposed use are not substantially similar to a listed use f where parking requirements are linked to the seating capacity of certain occupancies ie auditoriums stadiums churches lodge rooms etc the seating capacities for such occupancies shall in the absence of fixedseating be computed based upon the maximum occupancy of persons allowed under the florida building as may be amended from time to time for the purpose of determining the required number of offstreet parking spaces g fixed bench seating shall be calculated as one 1 seat per each twentyfour 24 linear inches excluding any fractions thereof h the parking required herein is in addition to space for storage of trucks or other vehicles used in connection with a business commercial or industrial use i where fractional spaces result from a required parking calculation the result shall be rounded up such that the parking stacking or loading spaces required shall be construed to be the next highest whole number for example if a parking calculation requires 199 spaces this number shall be rounded up to two 2 spaces j designated parking spaces and associated vehicular use areas shall be used for vehicular parking only no sales rental storage repair servicing of vehicles equipment or materials dismantling or other activities shall be conducted or located in such areas k all parking spaces required herein shall be located on the same lot with the building or use served except as provided under shared and offsite parking l parking areas shall be located so as to minimize conflicting movements between vehicles maneuvering in parking aisles and those vehicles traveling into out of or site  10282010   nonconforming parking facilities whenever vehicular use areas vuas including required offstreet parking or loading facilities are nonconforming as to any requirements of this the nonconformities may continue subject to the following conditions a substandard vua surface as a result of a change or expansion of use when an existing vua is unpaved or otherwise has a substandard surface and such vua is 1 increased in size by at least fifty 50 percent  or 2 the number of required parking spaces is increased by at least twentyfive 25 percent both the new portion and remaining substandard portion shall be improved to the paving and marking standards required herein b nonconforming parking or loading facilities 1 when a new use is established and the required parking is at a higher ratio than the ratio of the use it replaces parking must be provided based on the new use and current  should a building be expanded for an existing use within the building and the overall existing parking supply for the building or complex does not meet the current requirement parking must be provided for the expanded use at the current requirement for the new addition however parking provided for the existing building area although nonconforming does not have to be brought up to current requirements unless the existing parking surface is substandard and the percentage thresholds of a above have been reached 3 should state or federal disability accessibility codes require additional or upgraded disabledaccessible parking spaces the existing nonconforming parking lot may be upgraded to meet said without penalty to the property owner even if one 1 or more existing parking spaces are being removed to provide for disabledaccessible spaces

government buildings office buildings banks and other places of substantial employment or uses with similar parking characteristics b joint parking facilities 1 the required offstreet parking may be collectively provided by two 2 or more uses however the number of parking spaces shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the several individual uses if computed separately except as provided below 2 where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the zoning director that the peak hours of use for two 2 or more establishments on the same lot will not coincide or a parking demand study certified by a registered engineer determines on the basis of current peak usage that an existing use that is to be the subject of a shared parking agreement has surplus parking spaces the sum of the parking requirements for said establishments may be reduced  however said reduction shall not exceed twentyfive 25 percent of the total number of required offstreet parking spaces c administration and enforcement 1 it shall be the responsibility of the developer to provide the documentation necessary to determine whether the provisions of this section are applicable 2 in any case where the required parking spaces are not located on the same lot with the building or use served or where such spaces are collectively or jointly provided and used a written agreement thereby assuring their retention for such purposes shall be recorded and shall be filed with the application for a building permit a covenant running with the lands shall be recorded noting that the

to similar subject matter see the table for history authority this adopted in compliance with and pursuant to the local government comprehensive planning and land development regulation act et seq florida statutes 1989 as amended  5122016 legislative findings and intent a all of the above recitals are incorporated herein and made a part hereof b the following statements are hereby adopted by reference as the legislative findings of the city council for the city which shall act as further justification and authority for the adoption of this   to that end the city council finds that 1 it is the purpose of this establish a concurrency management system that ensures that facilities and services needed to support land development are available concurrent with the impacts of such development the concurrency management system is intended to ensure that adopted levels of service standards for potable water sanitary sewer solid waste and drainage shall not be degraded below the levels adopted in the city of pinellas park comprehensive plan by the issuance of a development permit or order 2 the city desires to establish a concurrency management system which informs the citizens about infrastructure deficiencies creates reasonable options to mitigate such deficiencies and allows development to the extent necessary to prevent taking of property without just compensation 3 not all such development activity impacts are significant enough to cause the deterioration of the level of service as adopted in the city of pinellas park comprehensive plan it is therefore further found that a minimal development impact which alone or in combination with other impacts will not cause an unacceptable degradation of existing levels of service is consistent with the goals objectives and policies of the city of pinellas park comprehensive plan finally application of this methodology is found to be substantially related to the preservation of individual private property rights in

in an enforceable development agreement acceptable to the city which requires the commencement of the facilities within one 1 year of the issuance of the applicable development orderpermit  or 6 the public facilities are required by the applicable capital improvements element to be constructed and completed when the impacts of development occur d concurrency test statement applied 1 after an application for development is accepted it will be reviewed and compared to the most recent concurrency test statement the impacts described in the application for development will be compared to the four 4 public facilities and services on the current concurrency test statement to determine the effect on the existing levels of service 2 if the most recent concurrency test statement shows the proposed development will fall within an area with an unacceptable level of service for one 1 or more of the four 4 public facilities or services identified herein a conditional letter of concurrency shall be issued authorizing the development only upon full compliance with appropriate specified provisions and measures as may be necessary to mitigate the impacts of development upon the deficient public facility or service in the event that there are no provisions or measures which can be imposed which will reasonably mitigate the impacts of the development upon the unacceptable level of service for any one 1 or more of the four 4 public facilities and services identified herein then the applicant will be issued a written statement denying a letter of concurrency 3 if the proposed development identified in the application for development being reviewed a has vested rights in accordance with of this   or b does not have impacts which will degrade any of the four 4 public facilities and services identified herein to an unacceptable level of service then a letter of concurrency shall be issued without provisions or measures attached as conditions e letter of concurrencyvalidity 1 the letter of concurrency shall be valid for purposes of obtaining development orders or permits for twelve 12 months from date of issuance 2 any development order or permit that is issued within the effective period of an existing letter of concurrency shall for purposes of concurrency only be vested in the event that a time extension is granted prior to the expiration of the approved development order or approved development permit then the letter of concurrency for the approved development shall be automatically renewed for the length of time of the extension 3 in the event that the development plan for a site changes relative to an increase in gross floor area or change in use within the effective period of an existing letter of concurrency the existing letter of concurrency will be reviewed for the incremental change the incremental change will require a complete review for impact upon the four 4 public facilities and services a concurrency determination will then be made for the incremental change 4 for those letter of concurrency issued for a development order issued by the city of pinellas park pursuant to the provisions of fs   as amended the duration of such letter of concurrency as issued shall be for the time period stated within the development order 5 the burden of showing compliance with concurrency standards and requirements shall be upon

underlying letter of concurrency only if such development order or development permit is consistent therewith  5122016 concurrency test statement and monitoring system a on october 1 of each year the city manager or his designee shall establish an annual concurrency test statement which is consistent with the provisions of this b the city manager or his designee shall establish and maintain a concurrency management monitoring system for the purposes of monitoring the status of public facilities and services and for establishing concurrency test statements c the remaining capacity reported for each public facility and service on the annual concurrency test statement should be determined by using calculations from the concurrency management monitoring system data base for existing development and for committed development of multiyear phased development proposals or projects including developments of regional impact development orders etc these calculations are to be based upon an acceptable projection for the progress of each proposal or project population growth projections andor such other considerations as are consistent with sound planning principles and practices d nothing herein precludes the periodic establishment of amendments to the current concurrency test statement if updating or correction is deemed necessary for any reason including but not limited to the following errors in information are noted  the impact of issued development orders or permits as monitored by the city manager or his designee indicate an unacceptable degradation of an adopted level of service  or changes in the status of capital improvement projects impact the underlying assumptions of the current concurrency test statement e under no circumstances will an amended concurrency test statement divest those rights acquired pursuant to d under the concurrency test statement as it existed prior to amendment except where a divestiture of such rights is determined by the city manager or his designee to be essential to prevent injury to the health safety or welfare of the general public f in determining the availability of services or facilities the city of pinellas park shall approve if requested by the applicant developments in stages or phases so that facilities and services needed for each such phase or stage will be available in accordance with the standards required by c1 of this   infrastructure impact area a an impact area for potable water sanitary sewer drainage and solid waste shall include all lands all or any portion of which are located within the service area of such facility or service as set forth in the comprehensive plan b provisions and measures which may be attached to letters of concurrency that will apply in impact areas include but are not limited to the following 1 project phasing a project may be divided into logical phases of development by area with approval for certain phases of the development being withheld until the needed facilities are in place 2 an enforceable development agreement in a form acceptable to the city of pinellas park which may include but is not limited to development agreements pursuant to florida statutes 3 requirements that the necessary facilities be in place at the time the impacts of development occur any failure to comply with any such provisions or measures shall constitute a violation of the letter of concurrency upon a determination by the city of such a violation and upon written notice thereof to the applicant then the letter of concurrency and all related development permits shall be revoked c an applicant who wishes to appeal any or all provisions or measures imposed by the city of pinellas park pursuant to this file an appeal before the concurrency management panel the appeals procedure is set forth in of this  5122016 recognition of established levels of service the city of pinellas park shall recognize those adopted levels of service as defined in its comprehensive plan as stated below a drainage the concurrency management system will require that all applicable federal state and local regulations be adhered to by the applicant in drainage design including but not limited to chapters 40d4 and 40d40 fac  pinellas park land development   and the pinellas park drainage element the drainage the city of pinellas park florida dictates that new drainage systems including pipelines detentionretention basins and other appurtenances be sized on the basis of a twentyfiveyeartwentyfourhour storm for drainage basins greater than one 1 square mile and a tenyeartwentyfourhour storm for smaller basins these requirements correspond to a service level a development occurring in service area of existing drainage systems including pipelines detentionretention basin and other appurtenances shall comply with the applicable requirement of drainage the land development classification system based on four 4 levels of protection has been developed the flood level designations a b c and d correspond to the following service level a this is the most advanced level of service providing complete removal of water from streets during the designated rainfall event all stormwater is captured by the collection system eliminating street storage systems significant ponding does not occur and the health and safety concerns associated with minor flooding such as exposure to sewage transportation hazards and vehicular flooding are eliminated service level b this level of service allows some flooding of streets during the designated rainfall event with minor flooding of some yards but prevents significant levels of yard flooding the flooding occurs from the overland flow of offsite stormwater surcharging the collection system and ponding in confined areas the primary impacts of this service level are nuisance flooding of streets making them temporarily impassable flooding is of a limited duration major roadways may have some standing water in some lanes but travel in the lanes is not restricted yard flooding is limited to areas away from structures service level c this is the minimum level of service that provides protection from flooding of structures flooding is caused by surcharging stormwater systems with runoff and ponding in low lying areas minor streets may be impassable for periods of time and major roads have reduced travel ability due to flood related lane closure yards are flooded up to the face of the structure however no inundation of structures occurs service level d major flooding is caused by the inability of storm drainage systems to remove run off under this level of service streets yards and structures all receive some level of flood damage and some major traffic arteries become impassable evacuation of some areas for health reasons may be necessary it should be noted that these levels of service only refer to the performance of drainage systems flooding caused by streams topping their banks due to abnormal influences such as ditch blockages or tidal surges are not addressed the level of service standard must be related to a designated rainfall frequency event such as a twentyfiveyeartwentyfourhour storm b solid waste and resource recovery the concurrency management system will utilize disposal of one and threetenths 130 tons of solid waste per person per year and maintenance of twice weekly garbage pick up and once weekly recycling pick up for residential accounts and on an as needed basis for commercial accounts c water supply for water supply the concurrency management system will recognize the criteria associated with the agreement between pinellas county county and the city of pinellas park city wherein the county agrees to furnish the city up to five million 5000000 gallons per day mgd yearly average of water for its use and redistribution in its water service area the pinellas park comprehensive plan has identified the impact of development upon the potable water system for residential uses as sixty 60 gallonspersonday and nonresidential uses as thirty 30 gallons per day per employee as identified in the pinellas county comprehensive plan assurances are given whereby the pinellas county water demand planning area will provide a level of service of one hundred twenty 120 gallons per capita per day gpcpd on an annual average d sanitary sewer the concurrency management system will recognize the agreement for wastewater transmission treatment and disposal services between pinellas county county and the city of pinellas park city the county treats city wastewater at its south cross bayou plant which has a twentytwo 22 mgd average daily flow subject to a capacity of thirtythree 33 mgd the pinellas park comprehensive plan has identified the impact of residential development upon the wastewater system as one hundred 100 gallonsdayperson and nonresidential development as one thousand 1000 gallons per day per acre  5122016 intergovernmental coordination a the city as the provider of public facilities or services to development within other governmental jurisdictions shall provide such facilities or services in accordance with the policies included in its comprehensive plan b development within the city which receives public facilities or services from other governmental entities shall recognize the level of service established by such entities in accordance with the policies of the city of pinellas park comprehensive plan  5122016 concurrency management panel a there is hereby established a city of pinellas park concurrency management panel which shall consist of the regular members of the board of adjustment upon the request of the chairperson of the concurrency management panel an alternate member of the board of adjustment shall act in place of a regular member who is temporarily absent and when acting shall have the full power of a regular member b hearings before the concurrency management panel shall be conducted in the following manner 1 the applicant shall present such evidence as he or she may wish to offer in support of his or her position one 1 or more full

and other matters on which the concurrency management panel is authorized to act under the provisions of this  5122016 vested rights a vested developments the following proposed developments shall be exempt from the requirements of the concurrency management system but not other applicable requirements for the time limits specified herein 1 each phase within a phased development which has been authorized pursuant to an approved final site plan and an approved construction schedule shall remain vested for the period of time established in the approved construction schedule in the event that the applicant fails to complete the development of any phase as required thereby then that phase and all subsequent phases shall no longer be vested 2 a development order for a development of regional impact which has been issued on or before  shall remain vested for the period of time specified in the original development order 3 an annexation agreement in effect on or before  which by its express terms and not by implication shall provide vested rights for the development of the parcel which is the subject thereof as specified therein such rights shall remain vested for the period of time specified in the annexation agreement b rights vested by the doctrine of equitable estoppel a proposed development may proceed even if deemed inconsistent with the city of pinellas park comprehensive plan if the city finds determination as described below that the owner or his representative has proven that 1 he or she acted in good faith and in reasonable reliance  2 upon some act of the city  and 3 has made such a substantial change in position or has incurred such extensive obligations and expenses that it would be highly inequitable or unjust to destroy the rights he or she has acquired
