determined that the new york state law with reference to changing the terms of office of local officials is totally inadequate based on the current state law future boards of trustees can change the term of office with a simple resolution and with very little opportunity for public input this board believes the state law does not protect the public inasmuch as it does not require a public hearing on the question of changing terms of office and it does not allow time for a fair open and very public dialogue without these two components the public is effectively removed from the process this article sets forth a series of events which will ensure that the public is aware early in the political process that its elective officials are attempting to change their terms of office and this will allow sufficient time and opportunity for the public to be actively involved in the decisionmaking process  542 legislative intent it is the specific legislative intent of the incorporated village of massapequa park enacting this article to protect preserve and ensure the integrity and continuation of the annual elections in the incorporated village of massapequa park  543 written petition for public hearing required in order to change the term of office for any elected public official or officials there must be a written petition signed by a minimum of 250 registered voters in the incorporated village of massapequa park requesting a public hearing to be held to change the term of office for said elected public official or officials which written petition must be submitted to the village administrator at village hall  544 petition and notification procedures for public hearing a scheduling of public hearing after receipt of this written petition within 60 days thereafter this matter shall be placed on the agenda at a board of trustees meeting for a vote scheduling thereafter a public hearing which vote must be approved by a majority of the entire board of trustees if

municipal law the town law and the village law all as amended the board of trustees of the incorporated village of massapequa park is empowered to enact local laws and ordinances licensing and regulating occupations and the conduct of business to protect and promote the health safety morals or the general welfare of the community therefore the village board of the incorporated village of massapequa park enacts this chapter entitled secondhand dealers  2742 findings of fact a there is no control in the incorporated village of massapequa park governing the activities of those persons engaged in the business of buying and selling secondhand merchandise some of these dealers represent to those persons involved in crime an opportunity to dispose of stolen property if the law enforcement agencies are to function an ordinance regulating these secondhand establishments is necessary b the ease with which some secondhand dealers buy and dispose of personal property indicates the need for the enactment of laws to control and regulate their everyday business transactions a few of the dealers require scant or very often no identification when purchasing personal property and rarely if ever is proof of ownership requested c it is a fact that secondhand dealers are not required at the present time to forward reports of acquired used property to many of the police agencies with the passage of this chapter reports would be required from dealers in secondhand jewelry marine equipment antiques cameras coins stamps musical instruments firearms and televisions as well as stereophonic equipment as a result of the reporting there would be a marked increase in the number of restitutions for the sole reason that now these merchants would be committed to keeping accurate records of the used property purchased and disposed of by forwarding the proper reports to the police on a daily basis at the close of each business day d this problem involving stolen property is not confined solely to the small dealers some of the very largest retailers in the nation those whose stores are located in the incorporated village of massapequa park buy large quantities of old gold jewelry and diamonds and forward not one single report of purchase to any police agency in the county the scope for the exploitation of stolen property is further broadened due to the operations of these merchandising giants e for small or large business enterprises to be allowed to continue to operate without laws to control and regulate the purchase of secondhand articles not only jeopardizes the property rights of many  2741 secondhand dealers  2742   2743 legislative intent  2744 definitions as used in this chapter the following terms shall have the meanings indicated dealer in secondhand articles  any person who in any way as principal broker or agent  2745 construal of provisions nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to apply to people but also extremely hampers the police agencies in their efforts to recover stolen property and identify suspects a the security involved in the handling of secondhand property has become a matter of concern to the police agencies charged with the duty and responsibility therein b the increase in the incidence of property thefts the widespread use of alcohol and drugs the decline in the value of the dollar the increase in the price of gold and diamonds and the specter of inflation where barter becomes more of a reality all point to the imperative that the best interests of the people of the incorporated village of massapequa park would be served by the enactment of this chapter c this chapter will ensure a dramatic rise in the percentage of stolen property recovered and an increase in the probability that the general public will receive a fairer deal in their business transactions and will better the means to allow the police agencies to obtain more information necessary to apprehend perpetrators of crimes associated with the theft of property thereby the public health morals and general welfare of the incorporated village of massapequa park will be protected and promoted deals in the

controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing within this jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in  2941 hereof a land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  c clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation  e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow  f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the village of massapequa park  g stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  h the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety i regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and
