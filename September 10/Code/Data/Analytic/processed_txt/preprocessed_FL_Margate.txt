chapter or the required elevation standards  b determination by the boa that 1 failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable  increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship  2 the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense nor create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances  and 3 the

shall be the policy of the city of margate that all water and sewer facilities which are determined by the administration to be needed to serve new and prospective users of the margate water and sewer

of margate those portions of the water and sewer connection charges as enacted by the city which are necessitated by the cost of new facilities for new and prospective users shall be prepaid by said users in cash at the time that said new users indicate to the city that they desire water andor waste water plant capacity specifically built and reserved for said users this section hereby implements the connection charge prepayment provisions of section 3973a of the city c no new water andor sewer capacity shall be approved unless allocation of water andor sewer capacity has been requested and paid for prior to the city of margate constructing the same except as provided herein d prepayment of connection charges shall be one thousand nine hundred twenty dollars $192000 per sewer erc and one thousand seven hundred ninety dollars $179000 per water erc for a total prepayment of three thousand seven hundred ten dollars $371000 per erc such connection charges shall be subject to adjustment as provided in section 3973 e the city commission may allocate water and sewer capacity to prospective new users who have not complied with paragraph c above but who pay all current appropriate charges

participate in the reservation of capacity program before said plant capacity was built or that hardship not of their own making existed preventing them from availing themselves of said opportunity f notwithstanding the above and upon payment of all currently applicable charges including those contained in paragraph d above the city commission may allocate more than five 5 equivalent residential units to any prospective user where it finds that the approval of the prospective new user serves a communitywide public purpose other than the construction of said project the generation of tax revenue or the creation of employment within the city of margate such finding of communitywide public purpose by the city commission includes the preservation of the integrity of the city of margate utility service area which includes the geographic area including the city of margate and the portion of the city of coconut creek south of coconut creek parkway all of which comprise the area supplied by the city of margate with waste water and water service g the city commission may allocate water and sewer capacity to a new user who has complied with paragraphs a b c and d above and is

demonstrate a hardship in that the user is unable to construct a specific development or developments without additional ercs for water andor sewer  b that the user demonstrate that any contemplated development or developments have been considered by the development review committee of the city of margate for site plan review  c that the user demonstrate that the user or his predecessor in good faith underestimated its need upon joining the prepaid program  d that the user demonstrate that it has not requested a prior variance pursuant to this section 2 the city commission with input from the administration shall grant no more than ten 10 ercs or an additional ten 10 per cent over and above the ercs that an original participantpurchaser in the prepaid program had previously purchased in said program whichever is greater but only upon a finding that the user or its predecessor had at the time of joining the prepaid program reasonably anticipated prospective uses for the property which is the subject of the variance no more than ten 10 ercs or ten 10 per cent over the original purchase of ercs shall be granted to any subsequent users and all subsequent users shall take subject to and limitation of the previous variances granted to users who are successors to the same original participantpurchaser in the program there shall be a specific finding by the administration upon the grant of every variance pursuant to his section that the number of ercs granted will not exceed the anticipated treatment capacity of the plant upon peak flow with the variance granted 3 any user granted a variance shall pay current connection fees and all other current charges for any ercs granted 4 that the city commission of the city of margate may refuse to grant any variance and thus allocate additional ercs pursuant to this section when it determines based upon information supplied to it by the administration that remaining capacity must be preserved in order to properly provide for those reservations which have been prepaid and no variance has been requested  221983   12221983   4241985   651985   6191985   8281985   10161985   3161988   341992   12102008 exclusivity of
