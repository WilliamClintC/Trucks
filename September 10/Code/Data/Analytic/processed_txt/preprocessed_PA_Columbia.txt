designed to a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of swm including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality d federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a

necessary to provide safe and efficient access to the development the abbreviated traffic impact study shall include a a capacity analysis report prepared under the supervision of a qualified and experienced transportation engineer b the study area for the capacity analysis report shall only include all proposed intersections 2 comprehensive traffic impact study a whenever a proposed project will generate 100 or more new vehicle trips in the peak direction inbound or outbound during the site peak traffic hour the applicant shall perform a comprehensive traffic impact study based on this study certain improvements may be identified as necessary to provide safe and efficient access to the development b transportation demand management measures such as staggered start and end work times telecommuting utilization of transit greenway or trail linkages parkandride lots etc may be used to reduce trip generation for the proposed development if such measures will reduce the new vehicle trips in the peak direction during the peak traffic hour to less than 100 then an abbreviated traffic impact study may be performed in lieu of a comprehensive study when such trip reduction measures are used to justify performance of an abbreviated study as permitted by this section a developer and successors shall be bound by a recorded agreement to implement such measures the terms and form of agreement shall be as mutually agreed upon by the borough and the developers 3 in addition a comprehensive traffic impact study shall be prepared at the discretion of the borough whenever either of the following conditions exists within the impact study area a current traffic problems exist in the local area such as a high crash location confusing intersection or a congested intersection that directly affects access to the development  19034 general provisions  19034  b the ability of the existing roadway system to handle increased traffic or the feasibility of improving the roadway system

rates required the traffic impact study shall include a table showing the land use categories and quantities with the corresponding trip generation rates or equations with justification for selection of one or the other and resulting number of trips the tripgeneration rates used must be either from the latest edition of trip generation by ite or from a local study of corresponding land uses and quantities all sources must be referenced in the study 6 consideration of passby trips if passby trips or shared trips are a major consideration for the land use in question studies should be referenced and interviews should be conducted and documented at similar land uses  19034 columbia code  19034  7 rate sums any significant difference between the sums of singleuse rates and proposed mixeduse estimates must be justified and explained in the study 8 explanations required the reasoning and data used in developing a trip generation rate for specialunusual generators must be justified and explained in the report 9 definition of influence area a prior to trip distribution of sitegenerated trips an influence area must be defined which contains 80% or more of the trip ends that will be attracted to the development a market study can be used to establish the limits of an influence area if available if no market study is available an influence area should be estimated based on a reasonable documented estimate the influence area can also be based on a reasonable maximum convenient travel time to the site or delineating area boundaries based on locations of competing developments b other methods such as using trip data from an existing development with similar characteristics or using an existing origindestination survey of trips within the area can be used in place of the influence area to delineate the boundaries of the impact 10 estimates of trip distribution required a trip distribution can be estimated using any one of the following three methods  analogy  trip distribution model  surrogate data b whichever method is used trip distribution must be estimated and analyzed for the horizon year a mixeduse development may require more than one distribution and coinciding assignment for each phase for example residential and retail phases on the same site consideration must also be given to whether inbound and outbound trips will have similar distributions 11 trip assignments a assignments must be made considering logical routings available roadway capacities left turns at critical intersections and projected and perceived minimum travel times in addition multiple paths should often be assigned between origins and destinations to achieve realistic estimates  19034 general provisions  19034  rather than assigning all of the trips to the route with the shortest travel time the assignments must be carried external site access points and in large projects those producing 500 or more additional peak direction trips to or from the site during the developments peak hour internal roadways when the site has more than one access driveway logical routing and possible multiple paths should be used to obtain realistic driveway volumes the assignment should reflect conditions at the time of the analysis assignments can be accomplished either manually or with applicable computer models b if a thorough analysis is required to account for passby trips the following procedure should be used  determine the percentage of passby trips in the total trips generated  estimate a trip distribution for the passby trips  perform two separate trip assignments based on the new and passby trip distributions  combine the passby and new trip assignment c upon completion of the initial site traffic assignment the results should be reviewed to see if the volumes appear logical given characteristics of the road system and trip distribution adjustments should be made if the initial results do not appear to be logical or reasonable 12 total traffic impacts motorized and nonmotorized traffic estimates for any site with current traffic activity must reflect not only new traffic associated with the sites redevelopment but also the trips subtracted from the traffic stream because of the removal of a land use the traffic impact study should clearly depict the total traffic estimate and its components 13 capacity analysis a capacity analysis must be performed at each of the major street and project site access intersection locations signalized and unsignalized within the study area in addition analyses must be completed for roadway segments deemed sensitive to site traffic within the study area as determined by the borough these may include such segments as weaving sections ramps internal site roadways parking facility access points and reservoirs for vehicles queuing on and offsite other locations may be deemed appropriate depending on the situation b the recommended levelofservice analysis procedures detailed in the most recent edition of the highway capacity  19034 columbia code  19034  manual must be followed the operational analyses in the highway capacity manual should be used for analyzing existing conditions traffic impacts access requirements or other future conditions for which traffic geometric and control parameters can be established 14 required levels of service the recommendations of the traffic impact study shall provide safe and efficient movement of traffic to and from and within and past the proposed development while minimizing the impact to nonsite trips the current levels of service must be maintained if they are levels c or d not allowed to deteriorate to worse than level c if they are currently levels a or b and improved to level d if they are
