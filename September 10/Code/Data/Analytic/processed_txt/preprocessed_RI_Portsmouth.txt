be the goal and responsibility of each project developer to present for review a complete and wellconceived set of documents that highlight and make visible the compatible character and architectural craftsmanship that will make their project worthy of praise and a good neighbor when built 1 the words acceptable appropriate attractive compatible complementary and other such words where judgment is inferred refer to the majority opinion of the design review board exclusively 2 where the word board is used it shall mean the design review board unless otherwise indicated 3 to provide guidance to building and property owners in the renovation and development of their parcels the term historic refers to buildings or plantings that predate 1940 a list of buildings considered historical by the ri historical preservation commission is available at the town planners office prospective builders and developers should consider their value in maintaining the character and context of the community charter  12412 c95 ii site design guidelines by responding to the larger contexts of neighborhood topography natural features circulation existing structures view corridors water elements skylines and open spaces the possibilities inherent in the site become visible the act of creating place begins with affirming what is already good and special about a site and introducing nothing onto the site that destroys that quality a general site b transitional areas 1 the site plan building design and landscaping of new development should achieve high quality and appearance that will enhance and be compatible with the character of the surrounding area 2 significant site features such as natural ground forms large rock outcroppings vegetation water and significant view corridors should be identified and incorporated into new development 3 the design of outdoor spaces should recognize and incorporate views climate solar angles and the nature of outdoor activities that could occur in conjunction with the project 4 where identified as appropriate new and existing development should include public plazas courtyards landscaping and similar amenities or public assembly areas that are accessible and visible from the street such amenities should be provided in scale appropriate to the size and location of the project 5 phased projects should be designed to the greatest degree possible so that each phase in and of itself is complete in functional visual traffic parking drainage and landscape aspects 1 site planning and design of projects proposed adjacent to dissimilar land uses should carefully address any potential undesirable impacts on existing uses 2 project sites that are impacted by excess noise from the surrounding area or that would create an excessive noise impact on adjacent properties should use both site planning and architectural solutions to minimize impacts 3 where adjacent uses are determined to be incompatible it is strongly recommended that a significant buffer zone be established which includes welldesigned largescale densely planted landscape elements which diminish the impact on the neighborhood commercial developments should be screened from residential zones see also in the zoning  a charter c c97 c grading d drainagestormwater management drainage issues are primarily reviewed by the planning board according to principles laid out in the subdivision regulations which primarily regulate this subject21 the following are additional guidelines e pedestrian and vehicular circulation reference is made to the zoning articles

strongly discouraged grading on new project sites should blend as possible with the contours of adjacent properties 2 the height and length of retaining walls should be minimized and should be screened with appropriate landscaping retaining walls should incorporate design elements of other architectural or natural features of the project 3 wood retaining walls and smooth faced concrete retaining walls are generally discouraged regardless of height 4 terracing should be considered as an alternative to the use of tall or prominent retaining walls particularly in highly visible areas on hillsides 5 grading under a drip line of protected trees is strongly discouraged in order to prevent soil compaction and significant root damage 1 drainage from rooftops or other impermeable surfaces should not be conveyed into planter areas that are surrounded by hard surfaces without a drain inlet 2 drainage should not be conveyed within the drip line of any tree on the site that will be retained 3 drainage from landscape areas should be properly conveyed and contained and should not drain freely across sidewalks landscape and building faces 1 circulation patterns should be as obvious and simple as possible all likely pedestrian routes should be considered in the design phase to eliminate short cuts which may damage the landscape areas 20editors note see ch 405 zoning 21editors note see ch 236 land development and subdivision regulations 22editors note see ch 405 zoning c portsmouth code e c98 2 every effort should be made to provide pedestrian routes and bike paths to adjacent neighborhoods 3 circulation systems should be designed to avoid conflicts between vehicular bicycle and pedestrian traffic pedestrian circulation should take precedence over vehicular circulation especially near buildings 4 redundant circulation that unnecessarily reduces the amount of site available for landscaped areas should be minimized 5 new driveways and parking facilities should be sited either immediately opposite street intersections or well away from them the number of driveways should be minimized but should always meet the requirements of emergency service vehicles 6 the number and width of curb cuts must be minimized consistent with the traffic sensitive district regulations in the zoning a wider curb cut may be appropriate on a higher speed street 7 where pedestrian circulation crosses vehicular routes a change in grade materials textures or colors is encouraged to emphasize the conflict point and improve its visibility and safety 8 circulation routes should focus upon main entries and exits and also identify secondary access points 9 all elements of the site design must accommodate access requirements of emergency vehicles and delivery vehicles the fire department stipulates space requirements between buildings and other immovable objects 10 service functions should be integrated into the circulation pattern in a manner that minimizes conflicts with vehicles and pedestrians 23editors note see ch 405 zoning art iii traffic sensitive overlay district e charter e c99 iii landscape design guidelines landscaping and plantings serve to screen define and highlight framing views and giving form to space landscaping is an integral part of any development a general b landscape design standards 1 welldesigned

linking neighborhoods and business areas are encouraged and should be subtly landscaped with native plant materials that require minimal care 10 native plant species should be chosen for all landscaping projects in portsmouth because they grow well in the climate and soil conditions of the area without requiring excessive irrigation 1 trees may be recommended in the public rightofway for all development within nonresidential districts the recommended tree list appendix ii designates recommended tree species for each street new trees should be planted consistent with the plan and the perimeter tree standards and guidelines 2 in commercial areas perimeter trees are recommended in addition to any proposed onsite landscaping to provide the shading visual enhancement and continuity for the streetscape 3 perimeter trees should normally be planted at fortyfoot 40 intervals 4 any existing perimeter tree that constitutes a specimen historic or protected may be substituted for a recommended perimeter tree 5 perimeter tree placement should include consideration for vehicle line of sight entrance and exit curb cuts street light and traffic control devices and other site specific conditions as part of design review process 6 plant materials and perimeter trees should be installed consistent with planting standards which specify soil depth irrigation requirements tree grates staking and other planting details 24editors note appendix ii is included as an attachment to this chapter b portsmouth code c c102 d landscape construction recommendations 7 where significant

surfaces which were previously covered by pavement or structures all existing asphalt base rock or other deleterious material should be removed to the depth of the native soil and clean soil should be used to backfill the planting area 3 all exposed dirt areas should be covered with bark mulch or other weed control measures included as part of final landscape installation c charter d c103 iv offstreet parking design reference is made to articles iii and ix of the zoning which primarily regulate this subject25 the following are additional guidelines a parking lot access b parking lot site design c parking lot landscaping 1 curb cuts must be minimized per the requirements of of the zoning traffic sensitive districts26 2 wherever possible adjacent parking lots must be connected or in the case of a vacant commercial lot a connection provided so that traffic may move between them reducing traffic on the arterial roadways 1 the visual impact and presence of vehicles should be minimized by generally siting parking areas to the rear or side of the property rather than along street frontages providing underground parking or parking garages andor screening parking areas from views exterior to the site parking areas may be appropriate in the front of the site in certain retail areas such as strip centers and shallow lots provided appropriate landscaping and setbacks are incorporated into the parking design 2 driveway entrances should provide ten feet 10 clear behind sidewalk or curb prior to starting the first parking space 3 where possible the last parking stall in an aisle should contain an end island area to provide adequate turning and maneuvering room 4 when parking must be adjacent to a street or public thoroughfare the use of berms and landscaping should be implemented to minimize the visibility of cars and headlights from off the site 1 parking lots should be designed with adequate landscape areas to avoid the appearance of a sea of asphalt a minimum landscape area of seventytwo inches 72 to the back of the perimeter curb stop should be provided where landscape separation is needed landscaping areas in which trees will be planted may need a ninetysixinch 96 minimum clearance 2 placement of landscape materials and signs should permit adequate sight distance for motorists and pedestrians entering and exiting a site see of the zoning vision

locations to avoid damage from vehicles c portsmouth code c c106 v fencing and screening design a design standards 1 existing stone walls should be preserved wherever possible where existing stone walls must be moved they should be replicated as nearby as possible within the site 2 new stone walls should be built to be compatible in material method and style with historic walls adjacent to or nearby the site 3 all fencing should be designed as an integrated part of the site rather than as a separate fence for instance planter walls and continuation of architectural walls are preferable to freestanding fences 4 chain link fencing is highly discouraged where used chain link should be green vinyl clad and have vegetative creeping cover within twelve 12 months of installation chain link along major thoroughfares is very strongly discouraged 5 use of special fencing design or materials should be discussed in the design narrative submitted as part of the design review application 6 all new sound walls masonry walls or fences fifty feet 50 in length or longer and four feet 4 in height or taller should be designed to minimize visual monotony in plane height material or material texture or significant landscape massing where appropriate 7 utility lines should be undergrounded within the town center area along identified scenic corridors at gateways and at other prominent locations 8 electrical transformers and similar utility structures should be underground or placed in the rear of the site if not feasible due to preexisting site conditions such as a high water table the facility should be enclosed within the building or adequately screened from the view of any public rightofway screening with solid materials such as berming or enclosures is preferable to reliance solely on planting 9 the design of fencing sound walls carports trash enclosures and similar site elements should be compatible with the architecture of the main buildings and should use similar materials 10 rooftop mechanical and electrical equipment microwave antennae or building elements to screen such equipment should be designed as an integral part of the building architecture it is strongly preferred that screens conceal equipment from view for a threehundredfoot 300 radius from the building at ground level 11 all exterior trash and storage areas service yards loading docks and ramps wood service poles electric and gas meters fire sprinkler valves irrigation backflow prevention devices transformers etc a charter a c107 b trash enclosures should be screened from view in a manner that is compatible with the building and site design screening should be well designed and materials should be substantial and durable generally all such elements should be located to the rear of the site andor away from a major street and screened to a height necessary to conceal the equipment from view for a radius of fifty feet 50 1 trash enclosures should be constructed of sturdy durable opaque materials with receptacles screened from view that are designed to be compatible with the project architecture 2 trash enclosures should include adequate accessible and convenient areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials dimensions of the recycling area should accommodate receptacles to meet the recycling needs of the project to determine the appropriate dimensions needed for dumpsters and waste wheelers contact the solid waste and recycling management representatives 3 areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials should be adjacent to the solid waste collection areas a portsmouth code b c108 vi exterior lighting design 1 historically appropriate lighting should be used for the renovation of all historic projects for new construction exterior lighting should be architecturally integrated with the building style material and colors 2 in the absence of appropriate historic lighting models concealed vandal resistant uplighting should be employed for lighting monuments or noteworthy buildings 3 excessive illumination of the signage building or site should be avoided roof lighting downlighting washing the building walls and illuminated awnings are all strongly discouraged 4 exterior lighting of the building and site should be designed so that light is not directed off the site and the light source is shielded from direct offsite viewing 5 fixture mounting height should be appropriate for the project and the setting use of low bollardtype fixtures are encouraged as pedestrian area lighting the mounting height of fixtures in smaller parking lots or service areas should not exceed sixteen feet 16 with lower mounting heights encouraged particularly where adjacent to residential areas or other sensitive land uses 6 raised light pole bases should be attractively designed and well detailed to be compatible with the overall project the use of sonotube type concrete pole bases is discouraged 7 exterior lighting sources that provide fullspectrum white light metal halide lamps or approved equal are strongly encouraged 8 full cutoff lighting is strongly encouraged charter b c109 vii architectural guidelines architectural guidelines help ensure that commercial development is in keeping with the high quality traditional new england rural characteristics of portsmouth as well as in keeping with the characteristics of the area in which a proposed development is located for example architecture typical of the southwestern states is not appropriate in portsmouth industrial style buildings are incompatible with commercial developments especially where they are adjacent to residential neighborhoods please see also the introductory statement why design guidelines are needed a general architectural guidelines 1 new architectural design should be compatible with the character of the neighboring area design compatibility includes complementary building style form size color and materials 2 building architecture should be designed to provide an attractive appearance prefabricated buildings are highly discouraged franchise or corporate style architecture andor highly contrasting color schemes are strongly discouraged if used such buildings should be substantially modified and embellished to create a project that meets the community standards all architectural details should be related to an overall architectural design approach 3 historic structures of merit should be preserved and maintained if the development requires relocation of an historic building every effort should be made to preserve the building 4 diversity of architectural design is encouraged highly stylized buildings that are characteristic of a particular historic period other than their own are discouraged unless a building or site is historically important to the district or necessary for architectural harmony 5 loud or gaudy colors sharply contrasting colors and highly reflective materials are not compatible with the character of portsmouth and should be avoided 6 efforts to coordinate the actual and apparent height of adjacent structures that are architecturally compatible with portsmouth are encouraged particularly where buildings are located close to one another aligning the height of a wall cornice or parapet line to that of an adjacent building is encouraged similar design linkages can be achieved to adjust apparent height by placing window lines belt courses and other horizontal elements in a pattern that reflects the same elements on such adjacent structures 28editors note the introductory statement is included as attachment 1 to this chapter a charter a c111 b storefronts facade and fenestration 7 multiple buildings on the same site should be designed to create a cohesive visual relationship out buildings should be designed to complement the primary building on the site in style and material expression 8 building siting should take best advantage of solar orientation climatic and other environmental conditions should encourage safety and privacy of adjacent outdoor spaces and should reduce the impact of noise upon or from the project 9 buildings that are stylized in an attempt to use the building itself as advertising are very strongly discouraged this is particularly true where the proposed architecture is the result of a corporate or franchise style 10 the visibility of rooftop equipment should be minimized by grouping all plumbing vents ducts and rooftop mechanical equipment away and screening from public view for a threehundredfoot 300 radius from the building from ground level 1 building facades should be compatible in scale mass and form with adjacent structures and the pattern of the surrounding area assuming the adjacent structures are generally in compliance with these design guidelines 2 exterior building design and detail on all elevations should be coordinated with regard to color types of materials number of materials architectural form and detailing to achieve harmony and continuity of design no more than three 3 paint colors should be employed excluding signage and awnings 3 rear and side facades if visible from public streets or neighboring properties should be carefully designed with similar detailing and materials and should be compatible with the principal facades of the building all elevations of the building will be evaluated in design review process 4 long unbroken or unadorned wall planes are discouraged massing of a building should not extend beyond fifty feet 50

integrated with their surroundings in terms of size shape color texture and lighting so that they are complementary to the overall design of the building and are not in visual competition with other signs in the area 5 compatibility all signs should complement their surroundings without competing with each other should convey their message clearly and legibly should be vandalproof and weatherresistant and if illuminated should not be overly bright for their surroundings new signs proposed for existing buildings should provide a compatible appearance with the building signage of other tenants with multiple signs on a single building an attempt should be made to bring in a unifying element such as size even where no sign program exists 6 mounting signs that are replaced on masonry or stucco exteriors can result in unattractive patched areas these potential maintenance problems should be addressed during the design phase of the project signs on masonry surfaces should typically be anchored into the mortar joints 7 businesses should not be oversigned sign ordinance limitations will be strictly enforced 1 individual type signs composed of individual letters are encouraged backlit halolit or reverse pan channel letters are generally desirable for logos and wider individual letters individual metal letters are often the best choice for office identification

identifies 5 landscaping landscaping should be designed around the base of freestanding and monument signs to integrate the sign with the ground plane and screen out any lowlevel floodlights irrigation should be designed so it does not damage the sign 6 skyline signs skyline signs placed on the upper portions of buildings should be constructed of individual halolit letters if illumination is desired 7 driveway directional signs these should only be used for projects where circulation is complex and traffic must proceed site along a specific path for service where the layout of the parking lot and driveways is obvious and clearly apparent to the driver entering from the street directional signage is not needed and is strongly discouraged in order to prevent visual clutter 8 standards where traffic control signage is used it should conform to the standards found in the manual of uniform traffic control devices mutcd and other such applicable codes 1 background dark

ample border around letters should be maintained standard proportions should be 14 borders letters and 14 borders 5 channel letters when using reverse pan channel letters avoid small printing as it does not read well at night the color of the trim caps should match the color of the letter face or the cabinet return 6 foam letters the use of plastic foam letters is recommended only if used eight

away 1 illumination shining light on individual letter signs is discouraged for both skyline signs and signs placed high on building walls business signs in residential zones may not be directly illuminated indirect lighting is encouraged 2 offsite glare arrange any external spot or flood lighting so that the light source is screened from direct view by passersby and so that the light is directed against the sign and does not shine into adjacent property or blind motorists and pedestrians where individual letter signs face nearby residential areas a low level of brightness can be maintained by using halolit letters 3 halolighting halolit or backlit letters are highly encouraged for both office and retail use such signs convey a subtle and attractive appearance and are very legible under moderate ambient lighting conditions face illumination letters may be appropriate for retail use c charter f c121 1 sign programs new construction design should anticipate signage and where necessary a sign program new building design should provide logical sign areas and dimension allowing flexibility for new users as the building is retenanted over time designs that provide for convenient and attractive replacement of signs are encouraged 2 complementarity sign programs should be designed to complement the style color and materials of the building the best sign programs are integrated so that they become a natural part of the building facade 3 design sign programs that provide attractive combinations of type styles and colors are encouraged within the sign program the background color type style and print color of the sign should be consistent however the use of a logo that provides identification for the business can be used to bring distinction to the business

intent to abandon the nonconforming use however if any nonconforming use is halted for a period of one 1 year the owner of the nonconforming use will be presumed to have abandoned the nonconforming use unless that presumption is rebutted by the presentation of sufficient evidence of intent not to abandon the use 4 a building or structure that exists as a nonconforming use at the time of passage

effective administration of an aed program for the town of portsmouth  a4082 background  intent  a4083 objectives a each year approximately 250000 people die from sudden cardiac arrest sca sca is a condition that occurs when the electrical impulses of the human heart malfunction causing a disturbance in the hearts electrical rhythm called ventricular fibrillation vf this erratic and ineffective electrical heart rhythm causes complete cessation of the hearts normal function of pumping blood and results in sudden death the most effective treatment for this condition is the administration of an electrical current to the heart delivered by a defibrillator within a short time after the onset of vf an aed is used to treat victims who experience sca it is only to be applied to victims who are unconscious and do not have a pulse signs of circulation and normal breathing the aed will analyze the heart rhythm and advise the operator if a shockable rhythm is detected if a shockable rhythm is detected the aed will charge to the appropriate energy level and advise the operator to deliver an electric shock b the chance of survival decreases an estimated 10% each minute without defibrillation even when prompt bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr is initiated the use of an aed is intended to maximize the chance of survival based upon the steps taken during the critical minutes before emergency medical services ems providers arrive and assume responsibility for the care of the patient the following policy and procedures are designed to direct trained responders in the town of portsmouth to deliver early defibrillation to victims of sca c the policy is intended to greatly increase the chance of survival of an sca prior to the arrival of the local ems this policy does not
