to constitutionally harmonize the interests of all parties engaged in or affected by peddler solicitor and canvasser activities the village approached the subjectmatter with a balanced design taking into consideration both the significant interests of government and the rights of individuals to publicly express themselves in a variety of ways the objective was to create a scheme that limited the role of government to those instances deemed necessary to protect its interests thereby entrusting to those targeted by speech with the primary responsibility of electing when and how they will participate in or be the recipient of any particular message the village implemented four 4 governmentallydirected proscriptions expedient to this objective i it removed discretion from decisionmakers charged with administering the process  ii it codified clear and unambiguous provisions that were not susceptible to capricious interpretation  iii it eliminated any need to inquire into the content of any message associated with an activity  and iv it mandated alternative opportunities for communication be made available when the primary method was unlawful or unavailable  10132014 definitions
