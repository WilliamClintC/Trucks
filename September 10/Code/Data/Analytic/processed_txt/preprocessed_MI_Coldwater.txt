ordinances  129920  1 the planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing support structure or other structure as documented by a licensed engineer and the existing support structure or other structure cannot be reinforced modified or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost 2 the planned equipment would cause interference affecting the function of other equipment on the existing support structure or other structure as documented by a licensed engineer and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost 3 support structures and other structures within the search radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary for the coverage area and capacity needs to reasonably function as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer 4 other unforeseen reasons that make it infeasible to locate the planned communication equipment upon an existing support structure or other structure b determining feasibility of collocation collocation shall be deemed to be feasible when all of the following are met 1 the applicantprovider will pay market rent or other market compensation for collocation 2 the site is able to provide structural support considering reasonable modification or replacement of a facility 3 the collocation being considered is technically reasonable and will not result in unreasonable interference given appropriate physical adjustments 4 the height of the structure necessary for collocation will not be increased beyond maximum height limits c refusal to permit collocation if a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication support structure shall fail or refuse to alter a structure to accommodate a feasible collocation such facility shall thereafter be a nonconforming structure and use and shall not be altered expanded or extended in any respect d refusal of collocation constitutes violation if a party who owns or otherwise controls a facility shall fail or refuse to permit a feasible collocation and this requires the construction andor use of a new wireless communication support structure the party failing or refusing to permit a feasible collocation shall be  129920 coldwater code  129920  deemed to be in direct violation and contradiction of the policy intent and purpose of this section of the zoning violation resulting in prohibition of new structures consequently such party shall take responsibility for the violation and shall be prohibited from receiving approval for a new support structure within the city for a period of five years from the date of the failure or refusal to permit the collocation f appeal of prohibition variance such a party may seek and obtain a variance from the zoning board of appeals if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance relief which in this context shall mean a demonstration that enforcement of the fiveyear prohibition would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent wireless communication services or that such enforcement would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless
