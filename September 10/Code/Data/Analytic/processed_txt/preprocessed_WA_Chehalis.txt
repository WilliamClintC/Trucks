ehm services  findings the city council of the city of chehalis has considered the risks and benefits associated with utilizing a combination of supervised and unsupervised alternatives to incarceration and have determined that the benefits of such programs outweigh the risk that some misdemeanants will commit offenses that might have been prevented if they were incarcerated in making this decision the city council finds that the majority of misdemeanants sentenced by the chehalis municipal court have committed nonviolent offenses and serve jail sentences of less than a week  that the misdemeanants routinely schedule a date to report to jail that is several weeks after the date of sentencing  and that the primary purpose of imposing jail sentences is to punish prior misconduct and to discourage future misconduct recidivism and not to prevent the commission of new offenses by removing the misdemeanant from society the city council also recognizes that an alternative sanctions program presents an inherent risk of shortcomings or errors in the selection and monitoring of misdemeanants in the alternative sanctions program nevertheless the city council concludes that an alternative sanctions program will help to reduce the costs incurred for incarceration of misdemeanants sentenced by the chehalis municipal court while still serving the purpose of punishment and reducing recidivism   definitions the following words terms and phrases shall have the following meanings asentence monitor shall mean the administrative staff in the municipal court that monitors

be installed in such a manner as to provide continuity for future frontage improvements from adjacent properties when properties are located at the end of a block the sidewalk curb and gutter may be installed around the corner of the side street to a logical point of discontinuation as determined by the director of public works 3sidewalk curb and gutter installation will be deferred for development projects along all other streets in the city unless one of the following criteria exists athere is existing sidewalk curb andor gutter adjacent to the development property  bthere is

installation will be deferred for development projects along all other streets in the city unless there are existing streetlights installed along any adjacent properties dexceptions 1if in the opinion of the director of public works the existing frontage features are properly installed in good condition operational and not hazardous to public health safety or welfare the development will be exempt from frontage improvement standards 2when frontage improvements are a continuation of existing improvements that no longer meet current city standards the proposed improvements may be allowed to maintain continuity if approved by the director of public works 3the following types of development will be exempt from the frontage improvement requirements aany addition to andor remodeling of a singlefamily residence or duplex bnew singlefamily developments that are not part of contiguous multiple singlefamily lots under sole ownership or that do not have existing frontage improvements abutting the property in question cany conversion or change in use of a development where the area being converted is less than 1000 square feet and the change in use is not likely to result in 25 percent more vehicle trips during the peak traffic hours trip generation rates will be determined on the basis of the methodology set forth elsewhere in these standards dany remodeling of an existing building or development if no change in use or additional gross floor area results and the cost of the improvements or alterations is less than 25 percent of the value of the existing structures on the property eany cumulative addition of less than 1000 square feet of gross floor area to a building or development as it existed on  edeferrals 1for all projects that are granted a deferral of any frontage improvement the property owner of record will be required to enter into an agreement with the city to install the deferred improvements at some future date refer to subsection e4 of this section this agreement will be recorded with the property to ensure the citys ability to enforce the deferral regardless of changes in property ownership and will be enforceable as allowed by law the property owner will execute and record a covenant document as supplied by the city ensuring participation of the subject property owners in the construction of frontage improvements the agreement will be effective for a period of 10 years from the date of recording as allowed by rcw  2any redevelopment project regardless of location that is necessitated by fire flood other natural disaster or act of the public enemy will be granted a deferral from the installation of frontage improvements under the following conditions athe redevelopment project is of the same size type and usage as existed on the property prior to the damage bthere are no negative impacts to the health safety or welfare of the public or environment that will be created or perpetuated by the delay of the frontage improvements cif the property is located on a street requiring mandatory frontage improvements as defined in these standards the deferral will be for a period of three years from the time of completion of the redevelopment project at that time the property owner will install the deferred improvements 3in certain circumstances it may not be appropriate to require the installation of frontage improvements at the time a development occurs the director of public works may authorize a deferral of any or all required frontage improvements as defined by these standards provided one or more of the following conditions are met athe design grade and alignment of the abutting street cannot be determined at the time of construction of the development bthe installation of frontage improvements required for the development would create or intensify a hazard to public safety or health cthe installation of required frontage improvements would be inconsistent with the citys longrange street or utility master plans dthe cost of the frontage improvement construction is greater than 25 percent of the entire development project cost unless necessary to protect the health safety and welfare of the public or environment the costs will be calculated by the owners representative and approved by the director of public works 4the city will initiate deferred frontage improvements under the following specific guidelines adeferred frontage improvements will be initiated by the city no sooner than three years from the date the deferral is granted unless the property in question is part of a local improvement district lid formed for the purpose of constructing the deferred improvement or a health or safety issue comes to exist as a result of the need for the deferred improvement bif the city or other entity initiates a project in the vicinity of the property where the improvement was deferred the improvement may be initiated if related to the work that will be performed cthe deferral is valid for a period of 10 years if the improvement is not initiated within that period the deferral will lapse and the property owner will no longer be bound by the conditions of the deferral a lapsed deferral does not exclude a property owner from participation in an lid   107 2005  variances apurpose any applicant may seek modification of the provisions of these standards where it appears that extraordinary conditions of topography access location shape size drainage or other physical features of the site or adjacent development exist bapplication procedure any development plan that includes a request for a variance to one or more of the requirements of these standards must be accompanied by a statement detailing any such variances and the reasons therefor variance requests must include the technical aspects of a specific project that necessitates the need for a variance a variance from the development engineering standards will not be granted based solely on financial or convenience issues upon receiving a variance request the director of public works will review the information presented and make a determination as to the merits of the request upon completion of the review the petitioner will be notified in writing of the directors decision cconditions no variance will be authorized that would have the effect of granting a special privilege not shared by other properties in the same vicinity to grant a variances the director of public works will determine whether the following conditions have been met 1there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions that apply only to the property referred to in the application and not to other properties in the vicinity these include but are not limited to size shape topography location or surroundings the granting of the application is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights of the petitioner 2the granting of the application will not under the circumstances of the particular case adversely affect the health or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the property referred to in the

development may with the approval of the city council enter into a contract with the city which will allow the developer to be reimbursed for the portion of the construction cost that benefits other adjoining properties andor is in excess of the minimum standards this contract is commonly termed a latecomers agreement the latecomers agreement should be submitted for review prior to plan approval however a latecomers agreement may be presented during the project as long as it is presented prior to any water andor sewer connection application approvals latecomers agreements will not be accepted after any water andor sewer connection application related to the project has been received and the fees paid latecomers agreements will be valid for a period of time as established by the revised washington rcw bthe developer is responsible for initiating executing and after council approval filing the latecomers agreement any application for a latecomers agreement shall contain 1a legal

community as a whole 2a 2005  streets ageneral city streets are classified as arterials collectors and local access streets in accordance with regional transportation needs and the functional use each serves function is the controlling element for classification and will govern rightofway street width and street geometries the public works department or designated consultant will determine the classification of new streets street design must provide for the maximum loading conditions anticipated the width and grade of the pavement must conform to specific standards set forth herein for safety and uniformity see table i minimum street standards bdesign standards the design of streets and roads will depend upon their type and usage the design elements of city streets will conform to

transportation facilities operate at a los c losc condition or better upon completion of the development 2the following guidelines will be used to determine appropriate mitigating measures of traffic impacts generated by proposed projects athe cost for the mitigation will be entirely borne by the proposed project however in the event that more than one development is being proposed within the study area a latecomers agreement for reimbursement of mitigation costs may be proposed by the project under consideration bcity projects involving transportation facilities programmed for improvements and having an adverse traffic impact will be mitigated by providing a proportionate share of the local costs for the improvements this share will be based on the percentage of proposed project traffic generated intersection the percentage will be based on the total projected peak hour traffic volumes for the horizon year of the transportation facility or as defined by the ordinance establishing the costsharing mechanism for offsite street improvements cnonsignalized intersections that currently operate at less than level of service c losc will be analyzed for traffic signal and intersection improvements if three or more traffic signal warrants are satisfied signal and intersection improvements will be required as a mitigating measure for the proposed project if at least three signal warrants are not satisfied by the proposed projects horizon year the tia will determine if traffic signal warrants and intersection improvements would be needed within a fiveyear period after the proposed projects horizon year if so the proposed project would then be required to provide a proportionate share of the cost of future traffic signal and intersection improvements 3when an offsite street improvements is not scheduled to be installed in the near future the city may allow a developer required to share in the costs of such improvements to post a bond in the amount of the developers pro rata share of such improvements any developer desiring to post a bond with the city in the amount of the pro rata share of improvement costs must submit a request in writing to the director of public works along with all applicable justification or information supporting the request the public works director will submit all requests to the city council who will then make a decision at a regularly scheduled council meeting all decisions made by the council will be considered final kmitigation fee calculation 1the formula for calculating a developers mitigation fee or proportional share of an offsite street improvement is derived by dividing the projectgenerated traffic by the future traffic with the project in order to determine the developers pro rata costs of an offsite street improvement this value is multiplied by the project costs mathematically this formula is written as follows pgtftp x pc   dmf pgt   projectgenerated traffic ftp   future traffic with the project pc   project cost dmf   developers mitigation fee 2participation threshold the city has established a participation threshold of 10 trips per peak hour the 10 trips per peak hour sets the minimum level at which a developer will be required to participate as part of the tia andor tgs intersections and traffic locations will be identified when there will be or are 10 or more new peak hour generated trips image   2g 2005 storm drainage and erosion control  storm water management ageneral the standards established by this article are intended to represent the minimum standards for

is required cthe proposed project could possibly impact a nearby stream wetland or body of water dwhen deemed necessary by another permitting authority 2site work will not commence until all erosion control measures have been set in place in accordance with the approved erosion control plans 3the contractorapplicant must ensure that all erosion control measures are properly maintained in accordance with standard industry procedures 4the general notes that follow will be included on any plans dealing with erosion control general notes erosion control 1erosion control measures will be in place prior to the beginning of construction a representative from the city will inspect and approve the erosion control measures prior to the start of construction 2erosion control measures are not limited to the items on this plan the contractor is responsible for the installation and maintenance of all erosion measures as required under the most recent version of the chehalis storm water management plan care will be taken to prevent migration of silt andor polluted runoff to offsite properties 3the contractor will make regular surveillance of all erosion control measures in addition erosion control will be thoroughly inspected after each rainfall event the contractor will make all necessary repairs modifications and additions as necessary to ensure the proper operation of the erosion control measures the city may require more frequent inspections of erosion control measures by the contractor should site or weather conditions dictate 4during the wet season november all disturbed soils will be stabilized within 48 hours after land disturbance activities have ceased erosion control measures will include but are not limited to installation of straw matting jute matting straw mulch andor wood chips and covering the affected area and spoil piles with plastic sheeting 5the contractor will check all seeded or sodded areas regularly to ensure that the vegetative cover is being adequately established areas will be repaired reseeded and fertilized as required 6tracking of soil off site will not be allowed if any soil is tracked beyond the limits of the site it will be removed before the end of that working day to prevent additional tracking vehicle tires must be swept or washed prior to leaving the project site 7no more than 500 lineal feet lf of trench on a downslope of more than five percent will be opened at one time 8excavated material will be placed on the uphill side of trenches 9excavated material will not be placed in established drainage ditches under any circumstances 10trench dewatering devices will be discharged in a manner that will not adversely affect flowing streams drainage systems or offsite properties an established sediment trap will be used as the receiver for all trench dewatering operations 11all disturbed areas will be seeded or sodded upon completion of work the contractor will be responsible to ensure that complete coverage of the disturbed areas is provided and that growth of vegetation is established seed and sod applications will be conducted in accordance with the timelines noted in the most recent edition of the wsdot standard specifications 12all erosion control will remain in place until such time as the site is adequately stabilized prior to removal of erosion control measures the engineering division will be notified for final inspection and approval bbest management practices erosion control may include the following 1sedimentation ponds asedimentation ponds are utilized to collect runoff generated on a construction site thereby allowing sediment to be captured before the runoff leaves the site sedimentation pond design will include the following considerations icomputation of the sediment storage volume  iicomputation of the settling volume  iiicomputation of the pond surface area surface area in square feet   1250 x oneyear 24hour storm rate in cfs bminimum pond dimensions are as follows itwofoot depth for settling  iithreefoot depth for sediment storage  iiithreetoone ratio side slope cthe contractor will inspect sedimentation ponds immediately after each rain event to ensure the integrity of the facility the contractor will also remove the majority of the sediment collected in the ponds whenever the storage volume is exceeded or the settling volume is infringed upon in addition prior to the final completion of the project ponds will be cleaned out in their entirety dthe lengthwidth ratio of the pond will be as large as possible a  ratio is the preferred minimum but exceptions may be granted when deemed appropriate by the public works department or designated consultant the pond will be divided into a series of at least two separate chambers perforated pipe risers will be used to convey water between the chambers and at the outlet 2interceptor channels interceptor channels are used to capture runoff generated on a construction site before it can leave the project limits the channel is often used in combination with a sedimentation pond the channel is typically grasslined and runs along the perimeter of the site the grass must be established prior to the start of construction therefore sod is often used to establish the vegetated surface of the channel upon completion of the project the sod can be removed and reused if the ditch is filled in and restored with a suitable and stable cover material 3sediment barriers sediment barriers are filtering devices that are run along the perimeter of a site to capture sediment while allowing runoff water to continue along its natural path silt fencing and hay bales are common examples of sediment barriers regular removal of sediment is required to ensure that the barriers function properly in addition the structural integrity of the barriers must be maintained at all times barriers will be installed inspected and repaired in accordance with the details and requirements included in these standards 4stabilized construction entrance a stabilized construction entrance is a rocked access point to a construction site the entrance reduces material carried from the site onto the public rightofway construction entrances must be cleared of mud and debris regularly to ensure that materials are not being tracked from the construction site onto the rightofway and beyond the contractor is responsible for all required maintenance of entrances 5detentionretention facilities no retentiondetention facility will be located in an area that is used to satisfy an open space requirement unless it enhances a recreational amenity use of designated open space areas for storm water detentionretention and infiltration must satisfy all conditions of the city of chehalis for

and the pipe lining to absorb water the contractor will be responsible for all costs labor and materials associated with the testing of the line the contractor will pay for all water needed for testing at the current rate charged by the city the test will be accomplished by pumping the main up to a pressure 150 psi above normal operating pressures but in no case will the test pressure be less than 200 psi after reaching the test pressure the pump will be stopped for 15 minutes and then the pressure brought back up to the test pressure again the quantity of water used to restore the pressure will be accurately determined by pumping positive displacement water meter the meter will be approved by the public works department prior to testing acceptability of the test will be determined by using the following formula l   n x d x p^12  7400 l   allowable leakage gallons per hour gph n   number of joints in the length of pipeline tested d   nominal diameter of pipe inches p   average test pressure during the leakage test psi if the water used to restore the pressure in the system is greater than the allowable leakage determined by the formula the main will be considered to have failed there will not be any appreciable or abrupt loss in pressure during the 15minute test period any significant loss will also be grounds for a nonpassing test should the tested section fail to pass the pressure test as specified the contractor will at no expense to the city locate and repair the defects and then retest the pipeline all tests will be made with the hydrant auxiliary gate valves open and pressure against the hydrant valve after the test has been completed each gate valve will be tested individually by closing each in turn and relieving the pressure beyond this test will be acceptable if there is no immediate loss of pressure on the gauge when the pressure comes against the valve being checked the contractor will verify that the pressure across the valve does not exceed the rated working pressure of the valve be tested will normally be limited to 1500 feet the public works department or designated consultant may require that the first section of the pipe installed by the contractor not less than 1000 feet in length be tested in order to qualify the crew and the material pipe installation will not be continued for more than an additional 1000 feet

commercial kitchens industrial processing facilities or other facilities where fats oils or grease fog could be otherwise discharged to the sanitary sewer system such equipment will be operated andor maintained by the owner or operator of such facilities so as to eliminate the discharge of these substances to the sanitary sewer system grease traps and interceptors will be designed in accordance with the most recent edition of the uniform plumbing upc as well as these standards grease traps and grease interceptors are placed on gray water drain lines from fixtures that discharge high concentration levels of fog they are generally installed on premises that have kitchens andor food preparation facilities for large numbers of people these facilities include restaurantsfood services hotelsmotels schools and institutions the purpose of a grease trap or a grease interceptor is to provide a place for the wastewater to reach a semiquiescent state and cool sufficiently allowing the liquefied fog to solidify and be retained before the wastewater reaches the sanitary sewer system the retained fog is regularly cleaned andor pumped out the maintenance frequency varies with each facility and will be established by a representative from the wastewater division 1grease trap a grease trap is a device designed to retain fog from a source of up to four fixtures grease traps are usually located near the fixtures being served inside the facility the connection of dishwashers to grease traps will be avoided when practical the maximum liquid temperature grease trap will be 90 degrees fahrenheit a dump valve may be required to ensure the liquid temperature standard is maintained at the discretion of the public works department all grease traps will be regularly maintained by the customer at a frequency as determined by the facility characteristics a maintenance log will be kept on site for recording of all maintenance activity at a minimum the log will contain date of maintenance andor inspection work performed and name of individual who performed service 2grease interceptor a grease interceptor consists of a tank with a minimum liquid volume of 750 gallons and serves multiple fixtures of a facility grease interceptors are generally located outside the facility they serve and are buried underground interceptors will be watertight and constructed of materials not subject to excessive corrosion appropriate tank materials include concrete coated metal and fiberglass plans for grease interceptors will include dimensions structural reinforcing structural calculations and other pertinent data as determined by the public works department interceptors will be designed by a professional engineer licensed in the state of washington blocation grease traps and interceptors will be located in such a manner as to be easily accessible for cleaning pumping and sampling in addition they will be as close as practical to the fixtures discharging into them in general an appropriate location is under a kitchen sink for traps or immediately outside the facility served for interceptors cdesign the following considerations will be factored into the design of a grease trap or interceptor 1capacity of the trap or interceptor  2appropriate baffling at both the inlet and outlet  3accessibility for cleaning and maintenance  4isolation from insects rodents and pests  5sufficient liquid travel time between inlet and outlet to ensure separation of the fog prior to discharge from the unit  6flow control fittings will be installed on the inlet side of smaller traps to protect against overloading and surges from the fixtures  7venting of outdoor interceptors is not required where siphoning of the contents is prevented by providing appropriately sized outlets dcapacity 1grease interceptor the size of a grease interceptor will be determined by using the following formula mph x wr x rt x sf   vol mph   number of meals served per peak hour or seating

and the public interest breasonable use standards to qualify as a reasonable use the decision maker must find that proposal is consistent with all of the following criteria 1there is no portion of the site under contiguous ownership not subject to critical area regulations where the provisions of this chapter allow reasonable economic use including agricultural use forestry use or continuation of legal nonconforming uses  2there is no feasible onsite alternative to the proposed use or activities that will provide reasonable economic use including location on any contiguous parcel that has been under the ownership or control of the applicant since the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter  other allowed uses  continuation of legal nonconforming uses  reduction in size change in timing of activities revision of road and lot layout andor related site planning considerations that would allow a reasonable economic use with less adverse impacts to critical areas and associated buffers  3the inability to derive reasonable economic use of the property is not the result of actions by the applicant in segregating or dividing the property andor creating the condition of lack of use after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter  4all reasonable methods to avoid or reduce adverse effects on critical area functions and values have been employed including locating activities as far as possible from critical areas and design that will result in the minimum alteration of critical areas and associated buffers existing topography vegetation fish

use of land in critical aquifer recharge area cara in order to ensure longterm protection of the water supply resources that exist under the citys jurisdiction  and to comply with the washington state growth management act   applicability acritical aquifer recharge areas are areas with a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable water these areas can fall within the citys jurisdiction where the prevailing geologic conditions allow infiltration rates which create a high potential for contamination of groundwater resources or contribute to the replenishment of groundwater critical aquifer recharge areas are rated as having high moderate or low susceptibility to contamination based on soil permeability geologic matrix infiltration and depth to water as determined by the criteria established by the state department of ecology bthe approximate location and extent of critical aquifer recharge area and municipal wellhead protection areas are shown on the aquifer protection overlay this overlay is to identify and classify vulnerable aquifer recharge areas within the citys jurisdiction protection of the aquifer within the critical aquifer recharge area is to be accomplished by controlling the use and handling of hazardous substances restrictions on development may be placed in order to protect public health and safety by preserving the existing and future groundwater supply for the city and urban growth area pursuant to the performance standards of cmc h   regulations aactivities may only be permitted in a critical aquifer recharge area if the community development director director determines that the proposed activity will not cause contaminants to enter the critical aquifer and that the proposed activity will not adversely affect the

also containing residential and other uses which were platted and built upon before the advent of current zoning and building codes bbuildings and uses within such historic districts due to the age and condition of the buildings and structures small lot size and high degree of lot coverage suffer from unique problems when required to adhere strictly to current zoning and building regulations cit is unduly difficult to repair remodel or improve existing buildings in the historic districts for existing uses or to establish new uses therein whenever such actions cause the building or use to be required to meet current zoning and building regulations dvariances from the requirements of current zoning and building codes are an inappropriate means of dealing with the problems of the historic districts as such problems arise from characteristics applicable to a large number of buildings within such districts rather than from the unique characteristics of each individual property ethis state of affairs contributes to the continued physical deterioration of buildings and to the loss of the ability to sustain viable business and other uses in the historic districts fpreservation and enhancement of the historic districts are deemed essential to preserve community identity and sociological integration as new development occurs in other parts of the city git is in the public

public health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city bintent 1there is convincing evidence that adult entertainment businesses because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them causing increased crime and the downgrading of property values  and 2it is recognized that adult entertainment businesses due to their nature have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other thereby contributing to urban blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent area  and 3the city council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of the citizenry  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods and deter the spread of urban blight  and 4it is not the intent of this chapter to suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment but to enact a contentneutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses  and 5it is not the intent of the city council to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material and the city council recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages law enforcement officials to enforce obscenity statutes against such illegal activities in the city cscopethe standards established in this chapter apply to all
