reach a decision on other pending motions subsidiary motions are always applied to another pending motion three subsidiary motions  motion to amend motion to limitextend debate and motion to call for the question  can be applied to other subsidiary motions all subsidiary motions are out of order when another person has the floor 1 motion to table a motion to table proposes that the consideration of a motion be postponed until a later time it is an appropriate motion to take up another matter out of order and to return later to the tabled motion the main motion can be brought back for consideration if a motion to recall is later passed by city council a motion that has been laid on the table will die if it has not been taken from the table by the close of the meeting following the meeting in which the motion was tabled amendments and debate are not allowed on a motion to table and it cannot be reconsidered 2 motion to call for the question if passed this motion cuts off debate and forces an immediate vote on the pending issue the motion to call for the question is neither debatable nor amendable but can be reconsidered up until a vote is taken on the called question the

a time certain setting a particular time for the main motion to be considered again which may be later in the same meeting at a future meeting or upon the occurrence of a specified event or the

matter to a committee and a council member believes further information or study is needed he or she may move it be referred to a committee or to staff for further study if an appropriate committee does not already exist a special committee can be formed as a part of the motion a motion to refer to committee may specify the date the committee or staff will report back if a special committee is formed the mayor will appoint its members and chair this motion is debatable and can be amended as to where the motion is to be committed and the date and time for report back 6 motion to amend a motion to amend is used to make a change to a pending motion amendments must be closely related to the original motion a motion to amend can itself be amended but the motion to amend an amendment cannot these rules are to be enforced by the mayor if the amendment is adopted city council will then consider the amended version of the motion c incidental motions incidental motions allow council members to appeal rulings by the mayor raise points of order question precedence of motions and raise objections to consideration of matters that are incidental to the discussions at hand but do not directly relate to the main question under discussion incidental motions are in order only if they pertain to the motion then pending if the incidental motion is in order it takes precedence over any other motions that are pending except as described below incidental motions rank below privileged motions and the motion to table 1 point of order the point of order takes precedence over any question from which it arose but yields to any privileged motion and a motion table the point of order is not debatable except that the mayor may ask the member raising the point to explain it is not amendable and cannot be reconsidered it does not require a second the point of order is in order when another person has the floor and can interrupt a person speaking if the point genuinely requires attention at the time it is raised normally the point is ruled on by the mayor and no vote is taken unless there is an appeal or the mayor is in doubt 2 appeal the duties of the mayor include making rulings on questions of parliamentary procedure an appeal to the city attorney as parliamentarian is available to members of council who believe the ruling was erroneous the appeal is in order when another has the floor but must be taken immediately after the ruling and is out of order if other business has intervened an appeal takes precedence over any pending question at the time the mayor makes the ruling it yields to all privileged motions an appeal can be reconsidered if there is no specific and controlling rule contained in this the council may thereupon make reference to and be guided by the current edition of roberts rules of order 3 motion to divide the question the motion to divide the question allows members to require a question dealing with a single subject to be divided into parts and to have each part considered and voted on separately this motion is not debatable and cannot be reconsidered it is amendable only with regard to how the question should be divided this motion is out of order when another has the floor it takes precedence over the main motion if applied to an amendment it takes precedence over the amendment but it cannot be made to the underlying matter with an amendment pending 4 motion to consider by section motions to consider by paragraph or to consider by section allow council to break down complex proposals into their component parts and consider debate and amend each paragraph or section separately this procedure can be applied by the mayor on his or her own initiative or by council following the adoption of a motion by any member this motion is not debatable and cannot be reconsidered it is amendable only with regard to how the question should be divided it is out of order when another has the floor it takes precedence over the main motion if applied to an amendment it takes precedence over the amendment but cannot be made to the main motion with an amendment pending 4 requests and inquiries from time to time council members may need additional background information or may wish to provide such information so council can understand better the issue under discussion requests and inquiries provide the vehicle for exchanging this information parliamentary inquiries and points of information may interrupt another who has the floor but only if the matter requires immediate attention requests and inquiries are not amendable debatable or subject to reconsideration no votes are taken on parliamentary inquiries or points of information  other requestsinquiries require a majority vote for passage except that reading of papers requires unanimous consent all share similar characteristics and can be subdivided into the following categories a parliamentary inquiry 1 such inquiries are always directed to and answered by the mayor and are used to clarify specific parliamentary or organization rules that have bearing on the issue at hand 2 point of information this inquiry is addressed mayor for information relevant to the business at hand 3 reading of papers no member of council has the right to read or have another person read from any papers or books as part of that members debate on any matter without unanimous consent of the other members of council even so it is customary to grant leave to members to read short pertinent printed matter 4 personal privilege examples of other privileges include requesting to address council on a personal or nonbusiness matter or if there is no motion pending requesting to make a presentation 5 recall motions two recall motions allow issues that have been previously disposed of or assigned to a committee to be brought back to city council a motion to reconsider any council member who voted on the prevailing side can make a motion to reconsider the motion to reconsider allows city council to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress or at the immediately preceding meeting  provided however that second reading to an ordinance may be reconsidered only at the same meeting if the matter to be reconsidered was the adoption of a resolution that has already been published or acted upon the motion is out of order the motion is debatable if the matter to be reconsidered is debatable but it cannot be amended or reconsidered if the motion to reconsider passes the original decision is voided and council will return to debate and vote again on the original motion subject to the time restriction above the motion to reconsider can be made at any time unless another member has the floor taking precedence over any other motion and yielding to nothing a motion to reconsider temporarily suspends any action growing out of the motion to be reconsidered b motion to recall from the table or from committee the motions to recall from the table and to recall from committee allow the city council to consider a question that has been tabled or assigned but not yet reported out of committee these motions take precedence over nothing and must be made when no other business is pending the motions are not debatable or amendable a tabled motion not recalled by the close of the meeting following the meeting in which it was tabled is dead 2  2 state law reference  57250b sc laws as amended minutes the municipal clerk shall keep the minutes of all public meetings of the city council which shall be a matter of public

ie the installation of thermal expansion devices andor pressure relief valves c low hazard residential irrigation system each low hazard residential irrigation system connection shall be protected by the minimum of an approved double check valve assembly d strainers the utility strongly recommends that all new retrofit installations of reduced pressure principle devices and double check valve backflow preventers include the installation of strainers located immediately upstream of the backflow device the installation of strainers will preclude the fouling of backflow devices due to both foreseen and unforeseen circumstances occurring to the water supply system such as water main repairs water main breaks fires periodic cleaning and flushing of mains etc these occurrences may stir up debris within the water main that will cause fouling of backflow devices installed without the benefit of strainers    permits the utility shall not permit a crossconnection within the public water supply system unless it is considered necessary and that it cannot be eliminated 1 crossconnection permits that are required for each backflow prevention device are obtained from the utility a fee of

is achieved with the utilization of a nontestable backflow preventer  existing inuse backflow prevention devices any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the utility to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health where the degree of hazard has increased as in the case of a residential installation converting to a business establishment any existing backflow preventer must be upgraded to an approved device or an approved device must be installed in the event that no backflow device was present  periodic testing a reduced pressure principle backflow devices and double check valve assemblies shall be tested and inspected at least annually b testing shall be performed by the utilitys certified tester or other approved contractor or tester this testing will be done at the owners expense c testing by the utility shall be conducted during the utilitys regular business hours exceptions to this when at the request of the owner may require additional charges to cover the increased costs to the utility d any backflow preventer which fails during a test shall be repaired or replaced at the owners expense when repairs are necessary upon completion of the repair the device will be retested at owners expense to insure correct operation high hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately in other situations a compliance date of not more than thirty 30 days after the test date will be established the owner is responsible for spare parts repair tools or a replacement device parallel installation of two 2 devices is an effective means of the owner insuring uninterrupted water service during testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such continuity ref drawing on file at the utility office e backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than specified in a above in cases where there is a history of test failures and the utility feels that due to the degree of hazard involved additional testing is warranted cost of the additional test will be borne by the owner    records and reports a records the utility will initiate and maintain the following 1 master files on customer crossconnection tests andor inspections 2 master files on customer crossconnection permits 3 copies of permits and permit applicants 4 copies of lists and summaries supplied to the department b

powers 34 1 division 1 introductory provisions intent of the redd the georgetown city council has determined that new heavy industrial uses are incompatible when in close proximity to the citys downtown waterfront historic district residential neighborhoods and gateway corridors and intersections it has been further determined by the council that the discontinuance of incompatible industrial uses is in the longterm interest of the city these areas should be redeveloped in a manner which improves property value promotes economic development and enhances the viability of surrounding residential neighborhoods and businesses while providing the owners of affected sites flexibility in the transition and repurposing of their lands the intent of this the districts created herein is to provide a regulatory framework that promotes the thoughtful redevelopment of industrial sites industrial districts and adjacent properties in accordance with the city of georgetowns comprehensive plan including the future land use map and the city of georgetowns official map specifically the provisions of this designed in furtherance of the comprehensive plan to encourage compatible redevelopment by 1 allowing a mixture of uses  2 prohibiting new heavy industrial uses while providing for the conditioned continuation of existing nonconformities  3 promoting setback height and other bulk and dimensional restrictions that are compatible with adjacent districts or provide for reasonable transition  4 providing density height parking and other development bonuses and design modifications for developments that provide additional open spaces or public amenities  5 protecting adjacent streets  and 6 protecting adjacent waterfronts and preserving andor creating viewsheds it is recognized that some aspects of the redevelopment and repurposing of former industrial sites may occur in the short term and that other aspects may take years to accomplish this article and the district created by it provide for short and longterm redevelopment with multiple options designed to afford flexibility to affected property owners the purposes and intent of each district is further described in division 2 summary of this article creates four redevelopment districts including a base redevelopment district and three floating zones each district allows but does not require a mixture of uses with permitted intensities and densities varying by zone heavy industrial and similarly incompatible uses are prohibited in the four districts and this article provides nonconformity standards to address the continuation and eventual cessation of these preexisting uses 2 properties may be rezoned by the city council to the redd base district to accommodate the repurposing and transitioning of lands from incompatible industrial or other uses to activities and uses that are economically viable and harmonious with the citys longstanding commercial and residential districts the base district allows for lower intensity nonindustrial development and retains many of the nondistrict specific requirements of the citys zoning ordinance property owners may choose to proceed with development under the standards of the base district  however this article provides the authority for the city council to apply three floating zone options available within the base redevelopment district each of which are described herein property owners may petition for the rezoning of their properties to one of these floating zones the flexibility afforded by the floating zones varies two of the floating zones require the approval by the city council of a development plan and development zoning text collectively referred to as floating zone district standards however the proposed standards must be in agreement with the comprehensive plan and the requirements of this article and must be approved by the city council if approved by city council floating zone district standards govern future development of the property within the floating zone table 2101 provides an overview of the different requirements and options provided under the four redd districts table 2101 summary of redd
