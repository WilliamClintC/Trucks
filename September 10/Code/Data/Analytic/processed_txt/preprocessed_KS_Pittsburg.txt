603d and kar 5444 by applying provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause increased flood height beyond 1 foot rise in the 100 year surface elevation or cause increases in water velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which service such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction 3 provide public information for evaluating land purchases of flood prone ground within the city 4 assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the city to purchase flood insurance in the federal flood insurance program 21102 findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of pittsburg kansas are subject to inundation which could result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare zoning subdivision regulations 92 2 these flood losses are caused by a the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities b the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others and which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages 3 the flood insurance study fis that is the basis for this a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps as follows a selection of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the regulatory flood selected for this representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrations flood insurance study and illustrative materials to become effective  and any future revision thereto495 b calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood c computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the regulatory flood 21103 general provisions 1 land to which regulations apply this apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of pittsburg kansas
