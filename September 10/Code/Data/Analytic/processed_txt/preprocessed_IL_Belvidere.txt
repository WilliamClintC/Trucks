as to cause waters to overflow onto adjacent property or to be discharged upon any public street or public way 7 storm sewers storm and surface water runoff as outlined in section 114301f of this  9616 national categorical pretreatment standards the pretreatment requirement shall apply to all nonresidential users subject to national categorical pretreatment standards promulgated by the usepa in accordance with section 307b and c of the act currently discharging or scheduled to discharge to the city the national categorical pretreatment standards found in 40 cfr subchapter n parts 405471 are hereby incorporated into this division limits in categorical pretreatment standards shall apply to the discharge from the process regulated by the standard or as otherwise specified by the standard compliance with national categorical pretreatment standards is mandatory the national categorical standards may be contained in the iepa operating permit 1 where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the pretreatment coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 cfr 4036c unless specifically restricted by the categorical pretreatment standard these equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with the following requirements are deemed pretreatment standards users shall be required to comply with the equivalent limitations instead of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived an alternative pretreatment limit shall not be used if the alternative limit is below the analytical detection limit for any of the regulated pollutants 2 when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit production the city may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual users the city calculating equivalent massperday limitations shall calculate such limitations by multiplying the limits in the standard by the users average rate of production this average rate of production shall be based not upon the designed production capacity but rather upon a reasonable measure of the users actual longterm daily production during a representative year for new sources actual production shall be estimated using projected production the city calculating equivalent concentration limitations shall calculate such limitations by dividing the mass limitations by the average daily flow rate of the users regulated process wastewater this average daily flow rate must be based upon a reasonable measure of the users actual longterm average flow rate such as the average daily flow rate during the representative year 3 when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the pretreatment coordinator shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 cfr 4036e provided that the regulation allows the wastewaters to be mixed and the user can supply the information necessary to allow issuance of an alternative limit 4 a user may request a variance from usepa based on fundamentally different factors the request must comply with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 cfr 40313 5 a user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with 40 cfr 40315 6 when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations a user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the pretreatment coordinator the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the user meets all the conditions set forth in below a to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the user must 1 employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  2 currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  3 provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  4 not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and 5 have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the users request for equivalent mass limits b a user subject to equivalent mass limits must 1 maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  2 continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  3 continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the pretreatment coordinator whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in paragraph a3 of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the pretreatment coordinator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 4 continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraph a1 of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit c when developing equivalent mass limits the pretreatment coordinator 1 will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  2 upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 3 may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to section 1143222 in this 7 the pretreatment coordinator may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual users the conversion is at the discretion of the pretreatment coordinator 8 once included in its wastewater discharge permit the user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical pretreatment standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived 9 many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or fourday average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitations 10 any user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the pretreatment coordinator within two city business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the pretreatment coordinator of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate all users that are subject to national categorical pretreatment standards are required to file reports as required in this division signed by an authorized representative per sections 114452 and 114453 of this reports shall

development is a special use development containing 1 two or more structures containing principal land uses on the same lot except for agricultural uses on lands zoned rh and on lands zoned gb gi or hi  2 any new institutional or commercial buildings in excess of 40000 gross square feet 3 any building additions to institutional or commercial buildings that bring the total building size to over 40000 gross square feet these regulations shall apply to the building addition the older portions of the building constructed prior to the adoption of this section and to the site a group development does not offer the ability to customize the regulations of this zoning ordinance as could be achieved using a planned development per  e b special use regulations any land use that is permitted as a permitted by right land use or as a special land use within the applicable zoning districts is permitted to locate within a group development the detailed land use regulations of this subsection that pertain to individual land uses shall also apply to individual land uses within a group development as will all other applicable provisions of this ordinance therefore land uses permitted by right in the zoning district shall be permitted by right within an approved group development unless otherwise restricted by the conditions of approval imposed during the special use approval for the group development as a whole and land uses permitted as a special use in the zoning district shall be permitted within the group development only with special use approval for the specific use in all cases the following special use conditions shall be applied to the group development as a whole and to individual uses within the group development 1 all required offstreet parking spaces and access drives shall be located entirely within the boundaries of the group development 2 the development shall contain a sufficient number of waste bins to accommodate all trash and waste generated by the land uses in a convenient manner 3 no group development shall take access to a local residential street 4 all development located within a group development shall be located so as to comply with the intent of this chapter regarding setbacks of structures and buildings from lot lines as such individual principal and accessory structures and buildings located within group developments shall be situated within building envelopes that serve to demonstrate complete compliance with said intent building envelopes shall be depicted on the site plan required for review of group developments the use of this approach to designing group developments will also ensure the facilitation of subdividing group developments in the future if such action is desired 5 the following standards shall apply to all group developments a building exterior materials shall be of high quality on all sides of the structure including glass brick decorative concrete block or stucco decorative architectural metal with concealed fasteners may be approved with special permission from the city b building exterior design shall be unified in design and materials throughout the structure and shall be complementary to

and location a central pedestrian gathering area shall be provided c discrimination against condominium forms of ownership it is not the intent of this section nor any other provision of this chapter to discriminate against condominium forms of ownership in any manner which conflicts with illinois state statutes as such the provisions of this section are designed to ensure that condominium forms of ownership are subject to the same standards and procedures of review and development as other physically identical forms of development  3606 article 3  density and intensity purpose the purpose of this article is to indicate the maximum permitted density for residential projects and maximum permitted intensity for nonresidential projects of development on any given site within the jurisdiction of this chapter see   the development potential of any site is determined by a variety of factors including but not limited to 1 the area of the site  2 the proportion of the site not containing sensitive natural resources  3 the zoning districts in which the site is located  4 the development options the site is developed under  and 5 the uses considered for development rationale regulates the development potential of all property within the jurisdiction of this chapter is designed to ensure the implementation of many goals and objectives of the city comprehensive plan see also   many of these are extremely difficult to address using conventional zoning techniques particularly those which rely on minimum lot area requirements to establish maximum permitted residential densities and maximum floor area ratios to establish the character of nonresidential developments such approaches provide for a minimum flexibility andor the needless destruction of sensitive natural resources the approach employed by relying on maximum gross densities mgds and minimum required landscape surface ratios lsrs for residential development and minimum required landscape surface ratios lsrs in combination with maximum permitted floor area ratios fars for nonresidential development both in conjunction with a variety of development options available in every zoning district results in a very high degree of site design flexibility and the protection and implementation of desired community character and adopted community goals and objectives  3606 how to use article 3 contains the standards that determine the maximum amount of development permitted on any given site prior to using the provisions of article 3 to determine the development potential of a given property the guidelines provided by  a c should be reviewed recognizes inherent differences between residential and nonresidential land uses and thus regulates their development in slightly different manners the description of the process addressing residential development in  a and b refers to the residential density standards within each district located in article 1 the description of the process addressing nonresidential development in  a and c refers to the nonresidential intensity standards within each district located in article 1  3606 required natural resources site evaluation a purpose an important goal of the city comprehensive plan is the protection of natural resources which are sensitive to disruption caused by development andor other land use activities these resources include floodways floodplain areas floodfringe shorelands wetlands drainageways lakeshores steep slopes and woodlands these resources serve important functions which are lost when these areas are subject to development andor other land use activities in the absence of correct mitigation approaches in many instances these functions cannot be provided by other natural or manmade features specific broad categories of such functions include the protection and enhancement of air surface water ground water and soil quality  habitat provisions and diversification  aesthetic diversification  and buffering effects b mitigation in certain instances natural features can accommodate development andor other land use activities without a significant loss of their functional benefits if proper mitigation practices are employed c natural resources site evaluation worksheet a natural resources site evaluation worksheet must be completed per the requirements described in  a3  3606 detailed instructions for density and intensity regulations a instructions for both residential and nonresidential development 1 check planning recommendations for the subject property a check comprehensive plan recommendations the citys comprehensive plan should be checked for implications related to the subject property particularly the land use and transportation plan maps copies of the comprehensive plan are available from the city from time to time the comprehensive plan may be amended the city should be consulted regarding any changes to the comprehensive plan that may affect the subject property or its environs 2 check the zoning of the subject property the potential amount and type of development any given site may contain is directly related to the zoning district in which the site is located the subject property should be identified on the citys official zoning map see   and the current zoning designation should be compared with the description of that district provided in   the official zoning map is on display at the citys public works department and planning department from time to time the official zoning map may be amended the zoning administrator should be contacted regarding potential changes in the official zoning map which may affect the subject property or its environs 3 complete a natural resources site evaluation for the site the effect of protected natural resources on the development potential of the subject property should be evaluated all resources listed in the natural resources site evaluation worksheet below should be identified on the subject property

the purpose of this article is to set forth the requirements for the protection and preservation of natural resource areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter in part the provisions of this article are designed to ensure the implementation of the adopted city comprehensive plan  3606 how to use this article this article contains the standards which govern the protection disturbance and mitigation of disruption of all permanently protected natural resource areas the provisions of this article are intended to supplement those of the city the county the state and the federal government of the united states which pertain to natural resource protection this article recognizes the important and diverse benefits which natural resource features provide in terms of protecting the health safety and general welfare of the community each of the following sections is oriented to each natural resource type and is designed to accomplish several objectives first a definition of the natural resource is provided second the specific purposes of the protective regulations governing each natural resource type are provided third the required method of identifying and determining the boundaries of the natural resource area is given fourth mandatory protection requirements are identified fifth where permitted mitigation standards are provided  3606 natural resource protection standards a compliance all new development including building construction other site improvements andor site preparation additions to existing development including building construction other site improvements andor site preparation along with all new subdivision plats condominiums and site plans in all zoning districts shall comply with the resource protection standards set forth in table  b natural resources to remain undisturbed all of the natural resources required to be protected under this article shall remain undisturbed and in a natural state except those natural resources where mitigation is permitted and where that mitigation is in strict accord with those requirements set forth in this article c disturbance of existing natural resources removal of protected natural resources as defined in this article from a property before any development approvals from the city are sought shall not be allowed unless the property owner obtains a site plan approval and meets the standards of this article for natural resource preservation all clear cutting and destruction of natural resource features shall 1 require a site plan review and approval as per   and shall be in compliance with the provisions of this article 2 be required to meet the protection levels described in this article 3 where such clear cutting andor destruction violations occur be required to meet

steep slopes or woodlands on such lands lands shall be considered to share a common boundary even if they are divided by a public road or navigable waterway or if they connect at only one point 4 whether mitigation is permitted shall be determined by the zoning administrator on a caseby case basis 5 if not otherwise restricted by state or federal regulations the zoning administrator may allow the filling or alteration of up to one acre of wetland without mitigation if such filling or alteration is essential for public safety purposes as defined under state law d natural resource protection plan if natural resource features defined and described in this article are present on a property a natural resource protection plan shall be submitted with the site plan   which shall show the

resources measurement all land area within a proposed development site plan subdivision plat or condominium consisting of the natural resource features defined in this article shall be accurately measured by the petitioner the total square feet and acreage of each natural resource feature shall be multiplied by its respective natural resource protection standard as set forth in table  to determine the amount of each natural resource feature to be protected by a conservation easement if two or more natural resource features are present on the same area of land only the most restrictive natural resource protection standard shall be used  3606 natural resource features mitigation a intent of mitigation the city recognizes that property owners subdividers or condominium developers may wish to develop in portions of those protected natural resource feature areas shown as eligible for mitigation in table  provisions in this article set forth the conditions for mitigation and mitigation standards for the various natural resource features for which mitigation is allowed under the provisions of table  the intent of these provisions is not to permit greater destruction of natural resource features than is permitted under the requirements of this article for a typical property or development this article sets specific standards for use when the extent of the natural resources on a site and the use of the regulations would create a major hardship for said natural resource feature protection thus mitigation is intended to be used instead of a variance request when severe hardships would result from the strict enforcement of the natural resource protection standards and requirements set forth in this article b offsite mitigation offsite mitigation may be permitted if such offsite mitigation occurs within the same watershed as the natural resource feature or property being mitigated and follows the methods requirements standards andor criteria set forth under this article all permitted offsite mitigation shall occur within the corporate limits of the city  3606 steep slopes a definition three categories of steep slopes are defined herein for use in this chapter these categories are based upon the relative degree of the steepness of the slope as follows 1 slopes of 20 percent to 30 percent inclusive 2 slopes greater than 30 percent 3 no land shall be considered a steep slope unless the steep slope area has at least a 20 percent vertical drop and has a minimum area of 5000 square feet b purpose steep slopes are particularly susceptible to damage resulting from site disruption primarily related to soil erosion such damage is likely to spread to areas which were not originally disturbed such erosion reduces the productivity of the soil results in exacerbated erosion downhill and results in increased sedimentation in drainageways wetlands streams ponds and lakes beyond adversely affecting the environmental functions of these resource areas such sedimentation also increases flood hazards by reducing the flood water storage capacity of hydrological system components thus elevating the flood level of the drainage system in effected areas beyond these threats to public safety disruption of steep slopes also increases the likelihood of slippage and slumpingunstable soil movements which may threaten adjacent properties buildings and public facilities such as roads and utilities c determination of presence steep slopes are to be determined by using the following sources andor methods in the order indicated below if the first source is considered inaccurate or inappropriate as determined by the zoning administrator the succeeding source shall be used 1 a topographic survey prepared by and certified by an illinois registered land surveyor at the petitioners expense at a contour interval of not less than two 2 feet 2 topographic maps on file with the city 3 usgs 75minute topographic quadrangle maps the area of steep slopes in square feet or acres shall be measured and graphically delineated on a topographic drawing and on the natural resource protection plan such steep slope drawing shall graphically indicate those steep slope areas by slope type of the property pursuant to the steep slope definition set forth in this section d protection standards steep slope areas shall be retained to the extent shown on table  protected portions of steep slopes shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted per the requirements of  j  3606 woodlands and forest a definition 1 woodlands young an area or stand of trees whose total combined canopy covers an area of onehalf acre or more and at least 50 percent of which is composed of canopies of trees having a diameter at breast height dbh of at least three inches however no trees grown for commercial purposes shall be considered a young woodland 2 woodlands mature an area or stand of trees whose total combined canopy covers an area of one acre or more and at least 50 percent of which is composed of canopies of trees having a diameter at breast height dbh of at least ten inches  or any grove consisting of eight or more individual trees having a dbh of at least 12 inches whose combined canopies cover at least 50 percent of the area encompassed by the grove however no trees grown for commercial purposes should be considered a mature woodland 3 woodlands include all tree species listed as large deciduous trees and evergreen trees as listed in appendix d b purpose woodlands provide a wide variety of environmental functions these include atmospheric benefits such as removing airborne pollutants carbon dioxide uptake oxygen production and evapotranspiration returns water quality benefits include substantial nutrient uptake rates particularly for nitrogen and phosphorus and surface runoff reduction in terms of both volumes and velocities woodlands provide unique wildlife habitats and food sources woodlands are excellent soil stabilizers greatly reducing runoffrelated soil erosion woodlands also serve to reduce wind velocities which further reduces soil erosion finally under proper management techniques woodlands serve as regenerative fuel sources c determination of presence 1 the determination of woodland and forest boundaries shall be determined by using the following sources and or methods in the order indicated below if the first source is considered inaccurate or inappropriate by the zoning administrator the succeeding source shall be used a a field survey of trees compiled at the petitioners expense by a registered land surveyor and identified by a landscape architect forester arborist or botanist with a professional degree in one of those fields of endeavor b the most recent one inch equals 400 feet aerial photographs prepared by the city 2 each woodland and forest area shall include the tree trunk and the area located within the drip line or tree canopy the area of woodlands and forests mature and young in square feet or acres shall be measured and graphically delineated on the natural resource protection plan such woodland and forest area drawing shall indicate all woodland and forest areas of the property meeting the minimum size criteria established by the definitions of woodlands mature and young in this section in cases where the drip line or canopy areas overlap the areas of overlap shall only be counted once in cases where drip line or canopy areas overlap property lines the property lines are to be used as the boundary for the woodland or forest area with only that portion of the drip line area located on the subject property counted toward the woodland or forest area the location size and summary of species types of all healthy trees having a diameter at breast height dbh of ten inches or greater that are located in woodland and forest areas within 25 feet of any proposed improvement andor in woodland and forest areas to be demolished due to the placement of improvements or grading are to be graphically shown on the natural resource protection plan or submitted as a separate drawing for the remaining undisturbed areas of the site plan subdivision plat or condominium only the outline of woodland and forest areas indicating whether they are mature or young woodlands is required the natural resource protection plan shall include an estimate of the percentage of all healthy trees within each woodland or forest area that have a dbh of three inches or greater and ten inches or greater d protection standards woodland areas shall be retained to the extent shown on table  protected portions of woodlands shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted per the requirements of  j e mitigation woodlands and forest areas may be mitigated under either of the following two alternative requirements applicable to the mitigation of woodland and forest areas except that the zoning administrator may approve different sizes and types of plantings in mitigation areas where site conditions or context warrant 1 alternative 1 a mitigation shall include the planting of 125 acres of new woodlandforest for every one acre of disturbed woodlandforest for which mitigation is required b mitigation shall include the replacement of woodlandsforests disturbed such mitigation shall consist of the planting of new woodlandforest areas as specified above using the following numbers of plants per acre of mitigated area 15 canopy trees minimum 35inch caliper 12 canopy trees minimum 2inch caliper 250 canopy trees minimum 4foot high whips 50 understory trees minimum 5foot high whips 25 shrubs minimum 12inches high note each 35inch caliper canopy tree may be substituted with two 15inch caliper canopy trees c all mitigation shall be in addition to landscaping required under article 6 2 alternative 2 a mitigation shall include the planting of 150 acres of new woodlandforest for every one acre of disturbed woodlandforest for which mitigation is required b mitigation shall include the replacement of woodlandsforests disturbed such mitigation shall consist of the planting of new woodlandforest areas as specified above using the following number of plants per acre of mitigated area 12 canopy trees minimum 35inch caliper 10 canopy trees minimum 2inch caliper 200 canopy trees minimum 4foot high whips 40 understory trees minimum 5foot high whips 20 shrubs minimum 12inches high note each 35inch caliper canopy tree may be substituted with two

perennial or intermittent flowing in a channel b purpose drainageways serve in the transporting of surface runoff to downstream areas as such drainageways serve to carry surface waters supplement floodplain wetland and water storage functions in heavy storm or melt events filter waterborne pollutants and sediments promote infiltration and groundwater recharging and provide a unique habitat at the landwater margin drainageway protection requirements preserve each of these functions as well as greatly reduce the potential for soil erosion along drainageways by protecting vegetative groundcover in areas which are susceptible to variable runoff flows and moderate to rapid water movement c determination of presence drainageways are to be determined by using the sources in the order indicated below if the first source is considered inaccurate or inappropriate as determined by the zoning administrator the succeeding source shall be used 1 a topographic survey prepared at the petitioners expense by and certified by an illinois registered land surveyor at a contour interval of not less than two feet 2 topographic maps on file with the city 3 usgs 75minute topographic quadrangle maps the area of drainageways in square feet and acres shall be measured and graphically delineated on the natural resource protection plan d protection standards drainageways shall be protected as indicated on table  protected portions of drainageways shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land use permitted per the requirements of  j e mitigation drainageway mitigation may be permitted under the requirements of the illinois state statutes and administrative rules promulgated by the illinois department of natural resources idnr if such statutes or rules do not provide sufficient guidance on required mitigation the city shall require the preparation and submittal of a wetland mitigation plan by a professional wetland mitigation specialist and the petitioner shall be responsible for all costs necessary for the city to conduct a professional review of the mitigation plan in addition a permit from the us army corps of engineers pursuant to the requirements of section 404 of the clean water act 33 usc 1344 andor the idnr shall be submitted to the city certifying that the filling has been approved and permitted by the corps andor idnr alternatively the applicant must obtain and provide to the city written correspondence from said agencies that a state or federal permit is not required as a condition of city review  3606 shore buffers a definition all of the land area located within 75 feet inland of the ordinary high water mark of all ponds streams lakes wetlands and navigable high water mark of all rivers b purpose shore buffers serve to protect landwater margins from erosion due to site disruption because of regular contact with wave action currents and runoff such areas are highly susceptible to continuous and in some cases rapid erosion shore protection also provides a natural vegetation buffer which serves to reduce water velocities and wave energy and filters significant amounts of waterborne pollutants and sediments shore buffers also promote infiltration and groundwater recharging and provide a unique habitat at the landwater margin c determination of presence shore buffers are to be determined as the land within 75 feet of the ordinary high water mark of all features shown on the usgs 75minute topographic quad map as a perennial stream and parallel to that ordinary high water mark where required if the first source is considered inaccurate or inappropriate as determined by the zoning administrator the succeeding source shall be used 1 a topographic survey prepared by and certified by an illinois registered land surveyor at the petitioners expense at a contour interval of not less than two feet 2 topographic maps on file with the city 3 usgs 75minute topographic quadrangle maps the area of shore buffers in square feet and acres shall be measured and graphically delineated on the natural resource protection plan d protection standards with the exception of the activities permitted below shore areas shall remain in undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted per the requirements of  j 1 tree removal a purpose the intent and purpose of this subsection is to preserve the natural wooded areas that help comprise the citys character maintain property values by improving and preserving the aesthetic appeal of the city regulations preserve the natural resources of the city and state reduce the amount of erosion in the city due to tree removal protect the quality of the waters of the state and the city and protect and promote the health safety and welfare of the people by minimizing the amount of sediment and other pollutants carried by runoff to surface waters due to the erosion of land not protected by a naturally wooded environment b clearcutting prohibition 1 waterfront shoreland areas in a strip of land 35 feet wide inland from the bulkhead line no more than 30 feet in any 100 feet shall be clearcut where the lot is less than 100 feet no more than 30 percent of this strip shall be clearcut natural shrubbery shall be preserved as far as practicable and where removed it shall be replaced with other vegetation that is equally effective in retarding runoff preventing erosion and preserving natural beauty 2 tree preservation area except for circumstances identified under subsection c below it is prohibited to remove any tree or cause any trees to be removed from the tree preservation area of each lot during construction no equipment movement construction or placement of equipment or material storage shall be permitted in the tree preservation area c cutting exceptions 1 trees may be removed from the building activities area this area shall be as small as possible including the entire area affected by building grading and temporary material storage areas in no case shall the amount of trees with a sixinch tree diameter removed within the building activities area exceed the following a 80 percent of the total of such trees on lots of  acre or less b 60 percent of the total of such trees on lots of  acre to one acre c 40 percent of the total of such trees on lots of one acre to 25 acres d 20 percent of the total of such trees on lots of 25 acres or more 2 trees removed in excess of the above will require a tree removal permit conditions under which a permit may be issued include but will not be limited to the following a the tree is dead dying or diseased b the tree is damaged or injured to the extent that it is likely to die or become diseased c the removal of the tree will enhance the tree preservation area and the health of the remaining trees d the removal of the tree will avoid or alleviate an economic hardship or hardship of another nature to the property or residences e the removal of the tree is consistent with good arboriculture practices 2 replacement trees when in keeping with good arboriculture practices replacement trees shall be planted for all removed trees they may be planted in the tree preservation area or in the building activities area after the initial construction activities are completed all replacement trees shall be planted within 30 days of final grading the determination of good arboriculture shall be based on tree density and spacing of table d 3 penalties any person violating any provision of this section shall be subject to a penalty per tree illegally cut or removed which shall be determined by the assessed value of the trees removed the assessed value shall be determined in accordance with the manual for plant appraisers published by the council of tree and landscape appraisers most recent edition in addition a replacement tree shall be planted of equivalent caliper to replace each tree cut illegally table d shore buffer replacement

requires that certain buildings or building additions constructed after the effective date of this chapter be accented by a minimum amount of landscaping placed near the building foundation a landscaping required by this section shall be placed so that at maturity the plants drip line is located within ten feet of the building foundation such landscaping shall not be located in those areas required for landscaping as street frontages paved areas protected green space areas reforestation areas or bufferyards sample configuration best suited for building foundations b for each 100 feet of building foundation perimeter the number of landscape points identified in table  shall be provided on a prorated basis and installed and permanently maintained per the requirements of   c climax trees and tall trees shall not be used to meet this requirement the intent of this section is to require a visual break in the mass of buildings and to require a visual screen of a minimum of six feet in height for all exterior perimeter appurtenances such as hvacutility boxes standpipes stormwater discharge pipes and other pipes d where the officially approved site plan depicts a future building extension the foundation landscaping requirement shall be calculated by measuring the length of the total perimeter however foundation plantings need only be installed based on the landscape points calculated from the portions of the building perimeter that will not be affected by building extension if this results in point requirements which are not met initial planting then a performance bond for remaining plantings shall be deposited with the building department 2 street frontages this section requires that street frontages on certain lots developed after the effective date of this chapter contain a minimum amount of landscaping in those areas which abut the rightofway of a public street a all landscaping used to meet this requirement shall be located within ten feet of the public rightofway in no instance shall such landscaping be located within a public rightofway landscaping shall not impede vehicle or pedestrian visibility sample configuration best suited for street frontages b for every 100 linear feet of street frontage where a developed lot abuts a public street rightofway the number of landscape points identified in table  shall be provided on a prorated

reforestation consultant chosen by the city with funding for consulting services provided by the petitioner to the city rationale the provisions of this section are designed to ensure that reforestation efforts required as part of woodland disruption mitigation standards result in the thorough and reasonably rapid replacement of the important and varied environmental functions which woodlands provide  3606 landscaping requirements for bufferyards a purpose this section provides the landscaping and width requirements for bufferyards on lots developed after the effective date of this chapter a bufferyard is a combination of distance and a visual buffer or barrier it includes an area together with the combination of plantings berms and fencing that is required to eliminate or reduce existing or potential nuisances these nuisances can often occur between adjacent zoning districts such nuisances are dirt litter noise glare of lights signs and incompatible land uses buildings or parking areas rationale one of zonings most important functions is the separation of land uses into districts that have similar character and contain compatible uses the location of districts is supposed to provide protection but in the city this is not the case since zoning districts permitting uses as diverse as singlefamily residential and industrial uses were located next to one another long before the effective date of this chapter bufferyards will operate to minimize the negative impact of any future use on neighboring uses b required locations for bufferyards bufferyards shall be located along and within the outer perimeter of a lot wherever two different zoning districts abut one another bufferyards shall not be required in front yards c determination of required bufferyard 1 identification of required level of opacity opacity is a quantitativelyderived measure which indicates the degree to which a particular bufferyard screens the adjoining property the required level of opacity indicated by table c2a is directly related to the degree to which the potential character of development differs between different zoning districts the required level of opacity is determined by the value given in the cell of the table at which the column heading along the top row of the table representing the subject propertys zoning district intersects with the row heading along the left hand side of the table representing the adjacent propertys zoning district the value listed is the required level of opacity for the bufferyard on the subject property 2 identification of detailed bufferyard requirements a if a proposed use adjoins a parcel for which a bufferyard is required by the presence of a zoning district boundary that use shall provide a bufferyard with the level of the opacity indicated in table c2a b for each level of opacity a wide variety of width landscaping point berm and structure combinations are possible the requirements listed in table c2b pertain to the number of landscaping points the minimum bufferyard width and the type of berm or fencing required within every 100 feet of required bufferyard a variety of landscaping point options are available and may be mixed within distinct portions of the same bufferyard sample configurations best suited for bufferyards  table c2a required bufferyard opacity values adj ace nt pro per tys zon ing rh sr 3 sr 4

the purpose of this subsection is to diminish threats to public health safety and welfare caused by runoff of excessive stormwater from new development and redevelopment this excessive stormwater could result in the inundation of damageable properties the erosion and destabilization of downstream channels and the pollution of valuable stream and lake resources the cause of increases in stormwater runoff quantity and rate and impairment of quality is the development and improvement of land and as such this subsection regulates these activities to prevent adverse impacts this subsection is adopted to accomplish the following objectives a to assure that new development does not increase the drainage or flood hazards to others or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion  b to protect new buildings and major improvements to building from flood damage due to increased flooding on a watershed basis  c to protect human life and health from the hazards of increased flooding on a watershed basis  d to lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects repairs to flooddamaged public facilities and utilities correction of channel erosion problems and flood rescue and relief operations caused by increased stormwater runoff quantities from new development  e to protect conserve and promote the orderly development of land and water resources  f to preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of watercourses and flood plains and to protect water quality and aquatic habitats  g to preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts improve water quality reduce soil erosion protect aquatic and riparian habitats provide recreational opportunities provide aesthetic

contribution in lieu of land are both necessary these occasions will arise when 1 only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a park site school site or conservation site that portion of the land within the subdivision falling within the park conservation or school location shall be dedicated as a site as stated above and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated  and 2 a major part of the local park site or conservation site or school site has already been acquired by the particular district and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site the remaining portion shall be required by dedication and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required c county conservation district it is recognized that it is more likely than not that land will not usually be available from a proposed development at locations reasonably usable for the county conservation district it is also realized that the majority of land utilized by the conservation district need not be fully improved and stubbed with city utilities and is frequently of a lower value than other lands accordingly and notwithstanding any other provision of this section when cash is payable instead of land the city council finds that cash for the district is based upon $2070000 per acre with an acreage requirement of 12 acres 4 density formula a the following table of population density is generally indicative of current and shortrange projected trends in family
