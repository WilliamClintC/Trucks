training in vta prior to starting inspections training will be available to other city employees a the department maintenance staff will use the vta outline and inspection document attached as exhibit 1 to  visual tree assessment vta encompasses visual and physical assessment for each tree typically the tree is identified described and sometimes photographed findings of the assessment are noted with recommended next steps such as maintenance followup monitoring or no action areas to be assessed for overall tree health and safety factors are i the ground around the root flare area where the roots are growing underground ii the root flare itself sometimes looks like an elephants foot iii the hole or trunk of the tree also sometimes called the stem iv the limb junctions where limbs branch off of the trunk v the scaffold branches big limbs which make up the crown of the tree vi the branches attached to scaffold branches vii twigs and fruit that could cause slip and fall accidents viii miscellaneous hazards such as thorns low hanging branch and lineofsight conflicts that impede the safe flow of traffic 2 red flags a visual tree assessment looks for i obviously rotted dead or decayed limbs trunks or roots  ii large holes in trunk  iii broken limbs  iv lightning damage  v storm damage  vi insect infestation  vii wind damage  viii improper trimming or aberrant growth  ix trees too close to the road  x lineofsight obstructed by vegetation b the city also desires a second level of expertise so it proposes to continue to work with a registered consulting arborist or the equivalent

its taxpayers have been obligated to finance public works projects public improvements within an economic development area eda 1 public improvements in an eda are intended to facilitate new development that otherwise may not occur or that may otherwise be delayed without the public improvements 2 new development creates additional taxable assessed value and real property taxes the additional real property taxes generated within an eda are necessary to finance public improvements and eventually lower the tax rates for other city taxpayers 3 the funding of public improvements to increase assessed value and the generation of tax revenue to pay for the public improvements has been and will continue to be a compelling governmental interest of the city because an increase in the citys tax base will continue to be a benefit for all of the city and its citizens 4 the use of land in an eda by property owners who are exempt from paying real property taxes tax exempt uses fails to satisfy the primary purpose of an eda when the eda was established because a tax exempt use benefits from the public improvements without contribution to the tax base that pays for the public improvements b applicability this apply to all property and to any petition application land use development or improvements and petition within an economic development area as established by the city and as may be amended from time to time in accordance with indiana law c development standards the development and design standards of the underlying zoning district as set forth by this shall otherwise apply to property within an edd overlay d restriction of use the use of land within an edd overlay that results in the real estate being exempt from payment of all or part of the real property taxes a tax exempt use shall be permitted only as a special exception see also special exceptions all other uses that are permitted in the underlying zoning district shall be permitted e exceptions from restriction of use the following shall be exempt from this shall otherwise be permitted within an edd overlay 1 a tax exempt use that is occupying eg leasing from a third party land or a building that is otherwise owned by a property owner not exempt from payment of all or part of the subject real estates real property taxes and the occupation by the tax exempt use does not cause the real estate to become exempt from payment of any real property taxes 2 public safety and services uses 55 floodplain overlay district fod a applicability 1 this apply to all special flood hazard
