thoroughfares the secondary arterial thoroughfares supplement the primary routes and are equally important elements of the thoroughfare system they are described below in detail awashington street  rossville avenue washington street now carries substantially as much traffic as main street and will continue to be a vital part of the major traffic system together with rossville avenue it provides a valuable route from the east part of the city to the intersection with highways 3839421 at kyger street the proposed designation of kelley avenue as a oneway street north and hoke avenue as a oneway street south would provide efficient connections with the east route of highways 28421 it is evident that this system would provide an efficient relief system of streets city rossville avenue should have a rightofway of 80 feet the other portions of the system do not require widening bwashington avenue washington avenue the michigantown road will carry a constantly increasing traffic load it should have a rightofway of 80 feet which should be obtained definitely east of kelley avenue cburlington avenue this street will become increasingly important as developments take place to the northeast it also should have a rightofway of 80 feet which should be obtainable without difficulty north of green street in order to make this street more efficient the jog at washington avenue should be removed this would require the purchase of two residences but the expense would be justified this would permit the easy flow and harmonious control of traffic traveling north on williams street into washington avenue or burlington avenue dhoke avenue  kelley avenue north of wabash street these two streets which have narrow rightofway could be combined as a oneway pair between wabash street and washington avenue and thus provide a desirable connection ecolumbia street  white street columbia street is an important northsouth relief street of the same character as washington street which runs east and west extending from green street to white street and using white street to jackson street it serves as a valuable element of the thoroughfare system no rightofway widening is necessary fmain street the short stretch of main street from green street to kyger street would continue to be a twoway street and would be considered as a secondary arterial street it has ample width garmstrong street armstrong street has always been an important southside street it collects traffic from the southwest part of the county and serves the southern portion of the city when the coulterwood addition was designed it was extended williams street the northeast areas are destined to become fine residential districts and it is extremely important that an efficient trafficway extend area it is recommended that armstrong street follow an alignment along a reverse curve and then along the section line midway between wabash street and kelley road to the proposed new primary arterial thoroughfare extending east of clinton trafficway this new section should have a rightofway of 80 feet heavy truck traffic should not be permitted to use armstrong street east of fifth street since such traffic would be incompatible with the residential developments adjacent to its route hprairie avenue this street which is a narrow country road at present should be developed with an 80 foot rightofway south of mckinley avenue ififth street the road extending south from freeman street which is substantially an extension of fifth street should have a rightofway of 80 feet and be designated as a secondary arterial thoroughfare jmaish road this road is becoming increasingly important as a traffic element and should by all means have a rightofway of 80 feet it should be opened into clinton trafficway south of kelley road and beyond kroad 100 north this road which is now open east of highway 75 should be extended west to the kreisher mill road it should have a rightofway of 80 feet lfreeman street this road is now open with a narrow rightofway between clay street and prairie avenue it should be designated as a secondary arterial thoroughfare west of fifth street and extended west with an 80 foot rightofway m alhambra avenue  hackett street alhambra avenue leads more and more traffic into the city from the kirklin road it could be widened along the fairgrounds but beyond its intersection with hackett street widening would be difficult it is recommended that north of ann street alhambra avenue be operated oneway north leading into jackson street also proposed as a oneway thoroughfare north hackett street in that event should be operated oneway east from columbia street this would permit main street traffic to flow easily into hackett street and pass to alhambra avenue and thence to the kirklin road nkelley road this road is open east of jackson street and should have a rightofway of 80 feet it is now a narrow country road but already carries much traffic west of jackson street this road should be opened into clinton trafficway and the thorntown road with an 80 foot rightofway due to the presence of the monon railroad the sections east and west of jackson street could not be connected in a practical manner oblinn road west of the intersection of blinn avenue and barner street blinn road should have a rightofway of 80 feet and should be designated as a secondary arterial thoroughfare passed 12786  2 feeder thoroughfares feeder thoroughfares supplement the primary and secondary arterial thoroughfares and carry considerable volumes of local and internal traffic normally they do not require wider rightsofway than they now possess but their efficiency may be promoted by constructing the widest roadways which their rightofway widths will permit and by limiting or prohibiting parking along their routes in order that adequate roadway widths may be available for traffic the time of establishing such parking limitations will be apparent as traffic becomes increasingly heavy the feeder thoroughfares are designated on the plan in order that their importance in the traffic circulation system may be emphasized aclay street this street is an important thoroughfare serving east side residential areas and extends from alhambra avenue north to kyger street at the gem city tpa park beast street this street carries a considerable load of local traffic between harvard terrace and washington avenue cwilliams street the importance of this street is apparent from the map and by observation on the ground and it will become increasingly important it extends from kelley road to washington avenue and will become more important when the jog with burlington avenue is removed at washington avenue williams street should be extended south of kelley road as a parkway drive wherever possible it should have a rightofway of 70 feet dsecond street extending from walnut street to freeman street this street bisects the residential area west of columbia street emain street  avery street north of kyger street main street and avery street should be designated and developed as feeder thoroughfares fdelphi avenue the short stretch of delphi avenue between green and kyger streets will be of less importance after the establishment of the oneway streets in that vicinity it should still be designated as a feeder street ghoke avenue this street should be extended to the south to connect with county road 150 kelly road although this avenue is classified as a feeder street rightofway south of wabash street need only be 60 feet hjackson street the block of jackson street north of kyger street provides the principal entrance to wesley manor and should be developed as a feeder street ikyger street kyger street is an important thoroughfare and has been designated as a primary arterial thoroughfare between jackson street and rossville avenue east of jackson street it leads to gem city tpa park and this section should be operated and developed as a feeder thoroughfare west of rossville avenue it serves the woodside area which has shown much improvement and rehabilitation during the last 15 years and will see desirable residential development west to clinton trafficway and beyond it should be designated as a feeder thoroughfare and extended beyond walsh avenue crossing clinton trafficway and uniting with the road 50 north at road 200 west the new section should have a rightofway of 70 feet jgreen street this is an important feeder thoroughfare from burlington avenue west it also is an access street to gem city tpa park the section from main street to john street forms part of the main streetjackson street oneway system this street extends dipping south around the oval and terminating at morris street it should be extended west to road 200 west west of walsh avenue every effort should be made to obtain a 70 foot rightofway kbarner street between clay street and the intersection of blinn avenue and barner street this is an important feeder thoroughfare serving the north side of the city lblinn avenue  morrison street these two streets form one street essentially between the intersection with barner street and clay street they carry a considerable volume of traffic and should be developed and maintained as a feeder thoroughfare m wabash street this street has always been of local importance as a feeder thoroughfare and should be so designated nfreeman street east of fifth street freeman street is of considerable importance as a feeder thoroughfare to clay street owilshire drive wilshire drive east and west of maish road has been developed as a portion of the wilshire and risse additions it would be desirable to extend it as a feeder thoroughfare with a width of 70 feet east to clinton trafficway and west to the proposed extension of armstrong street in the future heavy truck traffic should not be permitted to use it pkentwood drive kentwood drive would provide a convenient feeder thoroughfare connection between wilshire drive and wabash street but truck traffic should be prohibited from using it qmyrtle avenue this is an important feeder thoroughfare serving the residential areas in and adjacent to woodside it passes the woodside school and for that and other valid reasons should not be open to truck or heavy traffic it extends from morrison street to rossville avenue rcentral avenue this street is a useful feeder street between the woodside circle and blinn avenue shawthorne avenue between barner street and willow street this street is of local importance as a feeder thoroughfare it should be extended parallel to rossville avenue to an intersection with clinton trafficway it would form an efficient relief function for highway 3839421 and its new rightofway should be 70 feet wide passed 12786  3 residential streets the residential streets now in existence would not be subject to changes except in a minor sense new

zoning needs 2industrial districts 3commercial districts 4residence districts 5parks and recreational areas 6schools 7open land areas 8contingent uses and special exceptions  1 determination of zoning needs ain developing recommendations for zoning revisions in the city and its planning area consideration has been given to zoning experience in the city since the passage of the original zoning ordinance following its drafting in 195 industrial development which has taken place during the past 12 years and commercial and residential trends in the city and in other communities these experiences and trends have not only been considered but a block by block reconnaissance survey of existing conditions was made throughout the city and its environs these efforts have provided a clear understanding of the zoning needs of the city which may be specified in detail in the new zoning ordinance to be submitted later this appendix outlines the general requirements of the various districts and their boundaries bthe zoning plan accompanied by the zoning ordinance establishes the boundaries and specifications for the general types of industrial business and residential uses it does not specify the locations of parks schools and other types of land use which are essential elements of the development plan of the city and its expansion area these are discussed in  5 6 and 7 of this appendix  2 industrial districts aindustrial districts the determination of the boundaries of industrial districts is very important in promoting the economic welfare of the city several fine new industries have located in the city during the last decade and it is highly desirable that more of them seek sites in or near the city the aesthetic aspects of the new plants west of the city have combined to establish a most impressive and beautiful entrance to the city it is more encouraging to note that industry itself has found out that the location and construction of architecturally attractive buildings and superior development of sites contribute to the profitable operation of the industries many years ago a famous landscape architect coined the phrase what would be fair must first be fit modern industrial design certainly exemplifies this truism and the new plants are splendid examples which support it bi1 open industrial district this district which is shown by an appropriate technique on the maps includes substantially the same area as the i industrial district established by the present ordinance the only changes are minor and were the result of the reconnaissance referred to in  l within this district which includes the norfolk and western railroad yards industries which use both buildings and areas around the buildings for manufacturing processes and storage of materials raw materials or products may locate without restriction new industries would have to conform to reasonable performance standards which will be set forth in detail in the report on the zoning ordinance but otherwise there would be a minimum of restrictions residential or other nonindustrial uses would not be permitted in this district however business would be permitted ci2 enclosed industrial district this district includes the frontage along state highway 28 on the south side from prairie avenue to the western limit of the planning area  and on the north side from the lngrich plant to the western limit it is shown appropriately on the maps on the north the district extends to the property line of norfolk and western railroad and on the south the district is 1000 feet in depth measured from the center line of highway 28 the provisions of the zoning ordinance will be designed to perpetuate the application of the principles of industrial development which has produced such a fine effect by the existing industries these provisions will encourage the location of similar plants and will protect the existing industries from inferior or unpleasing installations which might thoughtlessly come about unless the specifications were adhered to no residential commercial or other land uses would be permitted in this district di3 reserved industrial district this district embraces most of the area included in the ml m2 m3 and m4 districts in the existing zoning ordinance it is the consultants opinion that the objectives of the present regulations can be met acceptably with only one reserved district industry would be permitted throughout this area enclosed industry is permitted in this district and there would be substantially complete freedom to pick desirable sites it is recognized that such a large area should not be reserved for industry exclusively therefore there are no restrictions prohibiting its use for residential development if there is demand for residential use prior to industrial demands however it would be unwise to permit commercial development either as special exceptions or without restriction if there is a demand for commercial use the sites should be established by amendments to the zoning ordinance or by utilization of shopping center plan procedures  3 commercial districts acommercial districts it has been recognized that the establishment of adequate commercial districts is vital to the economic welfare of the community it is also recognized that the uncontrolled location and construction of heterogeneous business establishments especially along highways entering a city with varying types of architecture and uses of land around buildings is detrimental both to the community and to the individual businesses many of the larger cities of the country suffer from deplorable entrances improvements in the appearance of central business districts and other business uses can be brought about by concerted action on the part of property owners the individual property owner can improve his store front or the site of his business in the small local business areas but adoption of reasonable requirements the zoning ordinance may be instrumental in preventing the development of undesirable conditions along highway entrances it is the consultants opinion that there should be three types of business districts established in the proposed zoning ordinance bgb general business district the boundaries of this district correspond generally to those established in the present zoning ordinance the modifications in boundaries are minor and were determined during the block by block reconnaissance all types of business including industry conducted entirely within buildings would be permitted in the district clb local business district these smaller business locations correspond very closely to those now established local business would require buildings to be set back 25 feet from the property lines of bordering streets nearly all types of retail business would be permitted but no industry would be allowed drb roadside business district this type of district is not included in the present zoning ordinance its use has become more and more desirable during the last decade within this district all types of business would be permitted as well as enclosed industrial uses the character of the district would be controlled primarily by requirement of a deep setback and planned development this setback should be not less than 75 feet from the proposed property line of the street upon which the business fronts the ordinance also restricts the front yard of the buildings against storage of materials or products or general cluttering of the front lawns but would permit entrance drives parking area and accessory uses such as filling station pumps eneighborhood convenience centers and shopping centers the proposed zoning ordinance provides for the location of neighborhood convenience centers on tracts of four acres or more and community shopping centers on tracts of 20 acres or more as special exceptions standards are established in the zoning ordinance relative to site design driveway treatment establishment of parking and lawn areas buffer strips and screen planting and other landscape architectural treatment these centers would be permitted by the board of zoning appeals anywhere if they conform to the standards of planning and design and after public hearings to determine their desirability passed 12786  4 residence districts athe proposed zoning ordinance includes five residential districts instead of four which are in the present ordinance the principal change consists of the proposal that a district be established which will contain the majority of large old houses which may eventually be converted into three or more apartments the existing zoning ordinance permitted such conversions and the erection of apartments in the c residential districts the general characteristics of the residential districts are as follows bs suburban residence district this district comprises the territory beyond the city limits which has not be proposed for industrial or business use within this district only singlefamily dwellings would normally be permitted they would require building sites with minimum areas of 16000 square feet and with minimum widths of 100 feet this regulation would apply where public water supply and public sanitary sewers are not available where such utilities are both available the lot sizes could be reduced to 8000 square feet with minimum widths of 66 feet as the city expands beyond the city limits of the planning area utilities services will generally keep pace with development which will permit the platting of lots in the 8000 square foot category ca residence district the a residence district would permit only singlefamily dwellings on sites with minimum areas of 8000 square feet and minimum widths of 66 feet these areas include newer developments much of the suburban area would actually correspond with the a district where utilities are available db residence district this district has substantially the same requirements as the present b district it is limited to singlefamily dwellings on sites with minimum areas of 6000 square feet and minimum widths of 50 feet the block by block reconnaissance indicates the wisdom of revising the coverage of this district a comparison of the existing zone map with the development plan will indicate where some of the blocks now within the c district have been placed in the b district ec residence district this district would permit both singlefamily and twofamily dwellings on lots with minimum areas of 6000 square feet and minimum widths of 50 feet the present zoning ordinance also permits conversion of large houses and the erection of apartments but it is proposed that this provision be eliminated from the proposed zoning ordinance fd residence district this district corresponds substantially with the provisions of the existing c district and permits apartments and the conversion of large houses the block by block reconnaissance revealed several blocks which would logically fall into this category gapartment dwellings during the last decade the demand for apartments has become very great in cities of all sizes provisions have been developed in zoning ordinances to meet this contingency the proposed revised zoning ordinance contains provisions setting up definite standards for the location of apartments and the provision of adequate open space around them so as to avoid damage to neighboring property and to meet the demands for apartment living garden apartments which include buildings which would not ordinarily exceed 212 stories in height and which would have well planned and developed open space around them could be located as special exceptions in the s and d residence districts and in the lb and gb business districts high rise apartments that is those which might be erected to heights of several stories provided that the sites would be large enough to ensure adequate open space about them could also be permitted as special exceptions in the s and d residence districts and the lb and gb business districts these provisions will meet the demands for apartments but will make sure that their plans have been carefully worked out have received the approval of the board of zoning appeals and that the public has had an opportunity to examine the plans and present their opinions at public hearings  5 parks and recreational areas athe city took a wise step forward about 45 years ago when the travelers protective association an organization of traveling salesmen stimulated a drive to acquire the present large city park which was given the name of gem city tpa park it has been of great recreational service not only to residents of the city but for many other people within a radius of 25 miles or more the park has an area of 893 acres which is supplemented by the ground owned by the frankfort country club which has an area of 23 acres a golf course is laid out in the park and the country club land and is used by members of the club and the public the park also has a fine swimming pool six tennis courts two shelter buildings picnic grounds with tables and outdoor ovens a band stand a baseball field and abundant play apparatus it is indeed an allpurpose park worthy of any city bin addition to the gem city tpa park the city has dorner park with an area of about three acres located south of prairie creek and west of clay street which has play equipment  john redmon park in the southwest part of town with an area of about three acres used as a local playground  woodside circle with an area of about one acre which has play apparatus  stott field where football games are played  the athletic field located south of the junior high school  and playgrounds at the woodside school and lincoln school the most recent acquisition of park land is the local park at the north end of the east park addition near the new high school it has an area of about 115 acres and provides play facilities for the children of the locality located between the building sites and the norfolk and western railroad it exemplifies a most appropriate use of land all new subdivisions should provide similar local park and playground facilities of which this is such a good example cthe new high school which has an area of nearly 80 acres has ample area for the installation of all types of recreation and athletics which will be required by the school children it is without doubt one of the finest high school sites in existence anywhere dthe total area of parks in the city at the time of preparation of the master plan in 1952 was 1161 acres since then east park has been added bringing the acreage to 1262 acres approximately this includes the country club which is essentially a part of the park provisions the population of the city in 1960 was 15302 and it is safe to estimate that it has at least 16000 population in 1965 the city therefore has one acre of park land for each 125 residents this compares very favorably with the desired standard of one acre of parks per 100 inhabitants area wise the city has about 8% of its area in park land this is somewhat below the desired standard of 10% ethe john redmon park should be enlarged so as to include the triangle between third street and the monon railroad it will be of increasing value to this part of the city passed 12786  6 schools the city has reached an ideal situation with respect to schools with the acquisition of the high school site of about 80 acres and the erection of the modern high school building the five other elementary schools and the junior high school provide adequate facilities for the existing city however the city is growing and much land to the southeast northeast and northwest will be developed for residential use as time goes on the southwest sector in which more industrial development is expected may also have considerable residential growth it appears likely that fewer schools with much larger sites will be located in the future rather than smaller installations about one mile apart this method requires more transportation facilities but has proven to be more economical from both the standpoints of construction costs and administration it therefore appears that there will eventually be a need for four or possibly five new elementary school sites in the planning area  7 open land areas athere are several areas around the city which appear to be destined to remain as open land among these are the fairgrounds it has an area of 447 acres and so far as can be estimated at this time will continue to be used for the clinton county fair for many years to come if the fair is discontinued the area would be ideal for recreational purposes as a matter of fact it could be used at present for field games and other recreation when it is not being used for the fair bthe wesley manor development which provides a modern home for the aged will doubtless expand the open grounds will always be an asset to the city although their use is private cthe isaac walton league property north of gem city tpa park is also in reality a recreational facility which provides recreation for a considerable group of the population if it is ever abandoned by the isaac walton league it should be incorporated into the park system dthe county home has a site of about 80 acres which will doubtless remain as an open area if it should cease to be used as at present it could very logically be developed as a fine residential area ethe pilgrim holiness college at armstrong and fifth street which is indicated on the map as school property is also a permanent open land area and forms a valuable asset of the city  8 contingent uses and special exceptions the provisions for the location of contingent uses such as schools churches public buildings and other uses remain substantially as they are set forth in the existing ordinance provisions for the granting of special exceptions for types of land use which are desired from time to time but for which actual districts cannot reasonably be set up are contained in the ordinance as proposed

provisions  15701 statutory authorization the indiana legislature has in ic 3674 and ic 14284 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions therefore the common council of the city of frankfort does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations passed 111411  15702 findings of fact athe flood hazard areas of the city of frankfort are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages passed 111411  15703 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to arestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  dcontrol filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  eprevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and fmake federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program passed 111411  15704 objectives the objectives of this chapter are ato protect human life and health  bto minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  cto minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  dto minimize prolonged business interruptions  eto minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  fto help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  and gto ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area passed

areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an underconstruction federal flood protection system these are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection system such as dikes dams and levees to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes zone a99 may only be used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion no base flood elevations or depths are shown mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements
