purposes of this section these styles are referred to as the designated historic styles historical buildings of empire and front street a notebook of photographs from the historical time period is available for review at the community development department 2architectural design review goals and standards in order to be approved a design proposal must comply with both the architectural design review goals and standards aarchitectural design review goals are the conceptual framework establishing the underlying objectives to be achieved by new development and modifications to existing

modifications to existing development adherence to the architectural design review standards ensures the conservation and enhancement of the special characteristics of each district barchitectural design review standards are mandatory approval criteria used in the design review process a design review application will be approved if the review body finds the applicant has shown the proposal

analyses and building code requirements for flood hazard areas 7there must be an adequate drainage system that removes flood waters from the interior area of the crawl space the enclosed area should be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event the type of drainage system will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage characteristics such as soil types possible options include natural drainage welldrained soils and drainage systems such as perforated pipes drainage tiles or gravel or crushed stone drainage by gravity or mechanical means 8the velocity of flood waters

established by city this document is intended to facilitate the planning design and implementation of public projects private projects and related facilities the design standards are primarily intended for use by a developers design engineer for private projects however they will also be utilized by design consultants under contract with the city for preparation of public infrastructure designs the design standards cannot provide for all situations they are intended to establish a consistent policy for implementing design of public improvements and related facilities but do not substitute for competent work by design professionals engineers are expected to provide expertise and judgment from their respective disciplines in addition to these standards design consultants and engineers must comply with appropriate state and federal codes safety regulations environmental requirements and other applicable regulations note that this document refers to many other potentially applicable requirements but references herein do not necessarily comprise a comprehensive list design professionals are encouraged to read this document prior to the project planning phase so that potential compliance issues may be identified and resolved early the citys unique terrain geology climate and historic context make project development to modern standards a challenging endeavor the city recognizes these challenges and encourages designers to actively collaborate with the public works department as new projects are planned designed and constructed the public works director or authorized designee has authority to periodically update and interpret the provisions of this document future modifications are intended to promote uniformity in the application of the design standards these standards are not intended to unreasonably limit any innovative or creative effort which could result in better quality public works will evaluate any proposed departure from these standards based on the design exception process detailed in cbmc other permits and standards may be applicable to specific projects the design professional bears the responsibility to obtain necessary permits and to comply with all applicable standards related to specific projects eds 1 2016 general requirements generally definitions and abbreviations permitting construction standards design
