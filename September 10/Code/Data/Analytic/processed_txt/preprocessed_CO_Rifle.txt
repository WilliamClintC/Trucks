some criteria are mandatory while other criteria are encouraged in order to be approved by the city a pud shall incorporate enough of the encouraged criteria to justify the flexibility afforded by the pud process each pud will be evaluated on a casebycase basis in order to balance flexibility with benefits to the city themes b1 b6 describe benefits that the city may receive from a pud themes b7 b11 describe areas of flexibility that the city may consider depending on the benefits provided by the pud the themes are intended to be interrelated so that individual criteria often reference and are dependent upon other criteria b review criteria themes city benefits 1 project design and land use 2 architecture and design 3 perimeter criteria 4 affordable housing 5 energy efficiency measures 6 parks and open space areas of flexibility 7 streets 8 setbacks 9 offstreet parking 10 lot size 11 signage c description of review criteria 1 project design and land use an interconnected neighborhood that connects different uses is preferred to culdesacs and separated uses a the pud should integrate a variety of housing types and commercial uses interconnected street network oriented towards pedestrian activity traditional neighborhood design is favored over conventional design smaller projects or projects with specific site constraints may only have a single land use or fewer street connections but must still meet as many criteria as possible b adjacent land uses shall be compatible with one 1 another and with adjacent developments c mixeduse buildings residential dwellings above compatible commercial or office uses are encouraged d commercial strip development that separates buildings from the street with large parking lots is discouraged commercial development oriented towards pedestrians and adjacent neighborhoods is encouraged in a residential pud commercial uses will be evaluated based on the architectural and design criteria and the economic benefit to the to the city this picture illustrates how a large retail center can avoid being a strip center parking is behind the building office uses are on the second floor and windows make the building transparent 2 architectural and design criteria pud architecture and building design shall demonstrate the cohesive planning of the development and present a clearly identifiable design feature throughout while also demonstrating creativity in the design of individual lots a successful pud will include a diversity of building styles and types that create an attractive living environment as promoted by the following criteria a the same exterior building elevation shall not repeat itself within three hundred twenty 320 feet of street frontage or four 4 consecutive building lots b a variety of building materials should be utilized including colors that vary but are selected for compatibility c buildings should be articulated by breaking up flat surfaces with balconies stepbacks projections and other

the dominant visual feature of the structure e the rear of a building shall not front on a local or collector street the preferred building orientation is for building entrances to front the street it is also acceptable for the side of a building to front a street if it is a corner lot the intent of this requirement is to encourage a livable streetscape that avoids dead streets and integrates adjacent neighborhoods this requirement is applicable to every street except those that have preexisting conditions that make houses facing the street undesirable or impossible f commercial and multifamily residential building design should be oriented towards pedestrians as provided for by the following criteria 1 place parking on the side or rear of buildings rather than the front of buildings 2 build up to the sidewalk and include an entrance from the sidewalk 3 for commercial uses make the building front permeable doors 4 the design of commercial multifamily or mixed use buildings will be evaluated based on the buildings relationship to the streetscape  the mass and bulk of the building should be at an appropriate ratio to the width of the street 3 perimeter criteria the pud shall take into account the use and character of adjacent neighborhoods to ensure that the pud is compatible with its surroundings the perimeter streets and boundaries of the pud shall conform to the following standards a if the use character or intensity of the pud is not compatible with adjacent neighborhoods the nuisance shall be minimized setbacks landscaping and screening the tendency of puds is often to isolate themselves from their surroundings which can result in dead streets b if the pud is compatible with surrounding neighborhoods or with what is likely to be developed in the future the neighborhoods shall be integrated to the maximum extent possible in order to prevent isolated neighborhoods and dead streets between developments perimeter streets shall serve as the glue between adjacent developments this is provided for by the following criteria 1 buildings shall front on the perimeter streets of the pud so that they face out of the development unless the condition of adjacent properties is undesirable or the circumstances of the site dictate otherwise 2 stubouts on streets shall allow for future connections to undeveloped parcels 3 frequent intersections with perimeter roads shall connect the interior street network with the exterior street network if an adjacent development includes a stubout or intersecting road the pud shall continue the street into the development 4 when appropriate higher intensity uses such as townhomes condos parks community facilities and commercial uses shall be located on perimeter streets to keep traffic off of minor streets and to amenitize perimeter streets 5 landscaping street trees and sidewalks shall be included on perimeter streets 6 consideration of appropriate uses setbacks and character of perimeter streets shall account for expected traffic volume 4 affordable housing puds shall seek to adopt strategies to increase the supply of affordable housing affordable housing is a benefit to the city that can be

of certain housing units remains affordable to residents who make a set percentage of the median income often fifty percent 50% or eighty percent 80% developers should work with a local housing authority to determine the appropriate pricing structure b owneroccupancy requirements this strategy places deed restrictions on whom may own the housing by limiting ownership to residents who derive ninety percent 90% of their income from the city speculation is prevented and housing costs are kept down c partnerships with essential workforce providers developers may partner with the school system the hospital or other essential employers to provide deedrestricted employee housing d cash contributions to the county housing authority these funds shall be used specifically for city housing

some of the key energy saving measures of leed and energy star include a building design and orientation buildings should be oriented to face within twenty percent 20% of due south for maximum solar exposure and designed for daylighting that reduces the need for electricity trees should be placed strategically to maximize energy savings recycling bins can be built into homes b water conservation grey water systems rainfall capture for lawnwatering xeriscaping and lowuse toilets and faucets are among strategies that can conserve water c construction techniques energy needs can be reduced use of proper insulation reduction of leaks lightcolored roofs green roofs and energyefficient windows and doors energy starrated appliances efficient heating and cooling systems and compact fluorescent

of land to the city which conveyance is accepted by the city all subdivisions of land located within the city are regulated by the provisions of this b major subdivisions are subdivisions that result in the creation of more than four 4 parcels lots sites tracts or interests out of the property as it existed prior to any subdivision c the division of lots or parcels of previously subdivided land is a resubdivision resubdivisions are reviewed as major subdivisions d the division of previously unsubdivided land into four 4 or fewer separate parcels lots sites tracts or interests is a minor subdivision e the creation or abolition of condominium units or of a planned community as defined in 22 crs constitutes the creation of separate interests and is considered a subdivision action f the correction of technical errors the adjustment of two 2 or more lot lines and the dissolution of two 2 or more lot lines on subdivision plats is accomplished by the preparation and processing of an amended plat provided that the corrections lot line adjustments or lot line dissolutions do not affect more than twenty 20 lots in the subdivision and provided further that the subdivision improvements agreement is in full force and effect and is not affected by the amended plat such actions affecting more than twenty 20 lots or affecting the subdivision improvements agreement or in a

or his or her designee will determine the technical adequacy of previously submitted information    amended plats a amended plats do not create additional lots or interests in property but are subdivision actions to the extent that lot lines may be adjusted or relocated by the amended plat process or more than one 1 lot combined for building purposes amended plats are also used to correct errors on a subdivision plat the amended plat process is limited to amendments that affect less than twenty 20 lots within a subdivision amendments affecting more than twenty 20 lots or amendments within a subdivision with an expired subdivision improvements agreement or which affect existing subdivision improvements agreements shall be considered resubdivisions amended plats are reviewed by the public works director planning department staff and appropriate review agencies prior to approval or denial of the amended plat by the public works department planning and development department and appropriate review agencies prior to approval or denial of the amended plat by the planning director pursuant to the requirements of of this b the first purpose of the amended plat review is to ensure the technical accuracy of the amended plat the second purpose of the amended plat review is to maintain the record of associated real estate activities    single lot line adjustment or dissolution the lot line adjustmentdissolution application process is limited to the relocation or elimination of a single lot line between two 2 conforming lots these applications are reviewed by the

faces on third street from east avenue to west avenue the northern block face of third street from east avenue to railroad avenue and additional properties on third street and fourth street several opportunities also exist for infill and redevelopment particularly at the edges of the subdistrict on third and fourth streets where the block faces should be continued all the way to east avenue and west avenue 3 primary land uses land uses in the historic core should promote pedestrian activity these include retail restaurants and complementary service uses on the ground floor with upperstory residential or office uses and civic and public uses 4 general design characteristics to maintain the citys historic and cultural integrity the design of new development and modifications to existing development should be thoughtfully designed to complement the key historic design elements of this subdistrict this includes brick as the primary building material and large ground floor storefront windows that contribute to the pedestrianoriented character although the design of buildings should reflect the traditional characteristics of the subdistrict opportunities should be sought to incorporate energy efficient elements as well 5 relationship of development to street new buildings in the historic core should fill in the existing block faces along third street and fourth street extending them all the way to east avenue and west avenue accordingly buildings should be pulled up to the sidewalk and include large display windows to increase pedestrian interest and activity the limited breaks in the block faces such as those needed for small parking lots should incorporate walls and landscaping andor decorative structures that visually continue the block face across the opening building sides along railroad avenue should be similar to those on third and fourth streets building and property sides along east avenue and west avenue also should be of high quality but are expected to have a lesser importance and are likely to provide secondary and service accesses figure 16182202 6 parking parking requirements in the historic core should be met combination of diagonal onstreet parking stalls and small surface parking lots situated to the side or rear of buildings but preferably not at street corners structured parking is discouraged and should include a face of ground floor retailcommercial uses along third street and fourth street and railroad avenue if it is used likewise large surface lots also are discouraged and all surface parking should be screened with walls andor landscaping 7 project review criteria the city will evaluate proposed projects in the historic core based on the following considerations in addition to all of the other standards contained in of this a does the project enhance the historic core as the cultural center of the community andor complement existing cultural amenities eg historic theater the museum and the historic post office b does the project contribute to and enhance the western smalltown charm of the historic core c does the project help preserve and sensitively restore historic buildings d does the project help preserve and restore the citys historic building pattern with complementary infill development e do the intensity scale and overall design of the project enhance the pedestrian friendliness of

subdistrict is to provide an attractive gateway into the downtown and create a transition between the autooriented commercial uses to the north and the pedestrian character of the central business district  overview of subdistrict character the intent of this to describe the desired character of the subdistrict and serve as a guide to developers and the city throughout the development process see below for more specificity on which items are required preferred discouraged and prohibited 1 building scale and intensity buildings in the north gateway should be consistent with the scale of the buildings in the historic core however the intensity of development may be somewhat greater than that in the historic core given that more autooriented uses are permitted in this subdistrict figure 16183201 2 redevelopment and preservation opportunities the existing buildings and properties within this subdistrict all present opportunities for redevelopment none were identified in the 2008 downtown master plan as highpriority preservation sites 3 primary land uses this subdistrict is intended to accommodate primarily commercial uses ground floor uses should consist of retail personal services and restaurants with upper floor residential or offices autooriented uses also are permitted such as service stations provided that various standards are met land uses on sixth street should be compatible with the school located to the north and those on the east and west ends of the subdistrict should be compatible with the adjoining residential neighborhoods 4 general design characteristics the intersection of fifth street and railroad avenue is the visual gateway into the downtown development on these corners should provide an attractive gateway quality design and architectural elements oriented towards the intersection preferred exterior building materials are primarily brick with large ground floor windows to maintain a pedestrianfriendly character and vibrancy although simple rectangular building forms consistent with those in the historic core are preferred the lack of any historically significant buildings in this subdistrict creates opportunities for somewhat more contemporary development 5 relationship of development to street development on the corners of the fifth streetrailroad avenue intersection should incorporate strong corner elements to create a strong sense of entry to the downtown throughout the north gateway buildings should include small setbacks and designs with high levels of transparency to encourage pedestrian activity figure 16183202 6 parking parking in the north gateway should be located at the sides and rear of buildings and preferably not along railroad avenue a mix of onstreet spaces both within this subdistrict and within adjoining subdistricts and smaller wellscreened onsite parking areas should be sufficient to address most of the anticipated parking needs of the district 7 project review criteria the city will evaluate proposed projects in the north gateway based on the following considerations in addition to all of the other standards contained in of this a does the project contribute to a positive gateway experience to the historic core and central business district b does the project complement the character scale and function of the historic core c does the project

subdistrict the purpose of the subdistrict is to create highquality higher density mixed use development and civic uses that bring vitality to the downtown  overview of subdistrict character the intent of this to describe the desired character of the subdistrict and serve as a guide to developers and the city throughout the development process see below for more specificity on which items are required preferred discouraged and prohibited 1 building scale and intensity the potential for redevelopment of most properties in the second street area permits a high level of density throughout the subdistrict between east avenue and west avenue the potential to assemble sites creates opportunities for large building footprints but heights should be limited so as not to overshadow the neighboring historic core subdistrict west of west avenue building heights can increase to achieve a scale more consistent with that permitted in the highdensity creekside neighborhood subdistrict while development within the second street area should respect the development scale and pattern in the historic core the second street subdistrict also should have a sufficiently high level of intensity to generate a concentration of activity and residents to increase the vibrancy of the downtown figure 16184201 2 redevelopment and preservation opportunities the second street subdistrict contains some of the citys most significant opportunities for largerscale redevelopment projects however consistent with the 2008 downtown master plan the rifle house should be preserved and adjoining development should be respectful of this historic structure 3 primary land uses second street should serve as a highactivity commercial and entertainment spine that attracts a regional market a high level of focus should be placed on ground floor retail restaurant and entertainment uses that literally spill out onto the sidewalk upper floors should contain a mix of commercial office and residential uses 4 general design characteristics within the second street subdistrict attractive modern architectural and site design should be incorporated this should include extensive use of ground floor windows the integration of horizontal building elements on taller buildings and the use of highquality building materials and architectural details wherever possible buildings should incorporate exposed sustainability components such as sky lights integrated solar panels wind turbines natural and local materials and similar features buildings located along rifle creek should relate to the creek by incorporating terraces and balconies oriented to the creek and footprints and stepbacks that maintain a comfortable pedestrian environment along the rifle creek trail figure 16184202 5 relationship of development to street buildings within the second street area should be pulled up to and oriented toward second street park avenue and highway 624 to encourage pedestrian activity however buildings can be set back as necessary to accommodate outdoor activity areas such as dining artistic displays and public gathering areas for taller buildings located west of west avenue upper stories should be stepped back to maintain a pedestrianfriendly experience along the street upper stories also should have a strong orientation to the street use of large windows balconies and terraces second street and park avenue should be extended consistent with the 2008 downtown master plan to improve circulation within the downtown and the community 6 parking given the desired intensity of development within the second street subdistrict parking will be a challenge that will have to be met using a number of tools second street itself should accommodate significant onstreet angled parking in addition new development should look to incorporate parking structures either under andor within the buildings parking structures on second street should be faced with commercial units to avoid large expanses of dead walls parking also may be phased as development occurs surface parking lots may be provided initially that are later converted to structures large expanses of surface parking should not be considered a longterm solution if the subdistrict is to achieve the desired level of intensity and activity accordingly flexibility publicprivate partnerships and shared arrangements between various property owners all will be necessary to meet this challenge 7 project review criteria the city will evaluate proposed projects in the second street mixeduse subdistrict based on the following considerations in addition to all of the other standards contained in of this a do the proposed land uses contribute to the desired dynamic mixeduse character of the subdistrict b does the project take advantage of the potential to assemble lots to develop largerscale uses c does the project have an appropriate level of densityintensity to foster a high level of activity along second street and throughout the downtown d does the project encourage people to gather in this area of the city and create a pedestrianoriented atmosphere e where applicable does the project extend second street and park avenue consistent with the circulation plan contained in the 2008 downtown master plan f does development along rifle creek relate to the creek by creating strong visual connections and providing a comfortable pedestrian environment along the creekfront trail g does development adjoining priority preservation sites complement those sites and set them apart in a

highway 624 and highway 13 and is the most important gateway into the downtown the subdistricts location also offers attractive views of the colorado river valley floor and surrounding bluffs the purpose of the subdistrict is to ensure that new development shapes favorable first impressions of the central business district presence of highquality largescale regional destinations  overview of subdistrict character the intent of this to describe the desired character of the subdistrict and serve as a guide to developers and the city throughout the development process see below for more specificity on which items are required preferred discouraged and prohibited 1 building scale and intensity the intensive nature of the potential uses should result in buildings with large footprints and multiple stories that draw attention to the river gateway area from outside of the downtown including i70 accordingly signature and iconic building designs should be considered to serve as guideposts for drawing visitors and those just passing the downtown figure 16185201 2 redevelopment and preservation opportunities no sites or buildings in this subdistrict were identified in the 2008 downtown master plan as highpriority preservation sites this subdistrict offers significant and largescale redevelopment and infill opportunities the entire subdistrict should be developed under a single master plan 3 primary land uses the river gateway is intended to accommodate highquality higherintensity commercial hospitality entertainment and civic uses as well as higher density multifamily residential development the subdistrict also is a potential location for a major transit center that could transform the downtown into a transitoriented development 4 general design characteristics development within the river gateway should be characterized by highquality urban architecture and oneofakind structures building elements should include those that expose their sustainable components such as skylights integrated solar panels natural and local materials and similar features in addition street frontage improvements landscaping and attractive signage should enhance this area as the primary gateway to the downtown and the entire community the larger parcels and lack of alleys in this subdistrict coupled with uses of a regional nature will likely result in an urban campustype of development pattern 5 relationship of development to street consistent with the 2009 rifle gateway alternatives report highway 624 is expected to flank the north and south sides of the district as a oneway couplet with railroad avenue west avenue and park avenue extended south to the new eastbound leg of highway 624 buildings should have a strong visual orientation to highways 624 and 13 even if their main entries face an internal street buildings may be pulled up to the sidewalks or sites may have highly landscaped setbacks that provide sufficient buffering from the high traffic levels on the adjoining highways upper floors should be oriented toward views of the river and the ranges to the south and north figure 16185202 6 parking parking needs in the river gateway are likely to be substantial and will likely eventually require one 1 or more parking structures these structures should be fully integrated into the overall development by reflecting the high quality materials used on the principal buildings parking may be phased over time starting with screened surface lots that are eventually converted to structures however surface parking between buildings and the adjoining thoroughfares should be minimized with the majority of parking placed toward the center of the district between buildings 7 project review criteria the city will evaluate proposed projects in the river gateway subdistrict based on the following considerations in addition to all of the other standards contained in of this a does the project contribute to a positive city gateway experience putting forth a highquality image for the central business district and the entire city b does the project have an appropriate level of densityintensity to foster a dynamic mixeduse environment with regional scale uses andor transitoriented development c do the buildings and uses provide a recognizable destination that will draw visitors into the downtown and to the riverfront d

development in all of the city the purposes of the subdistrict are to promote highdensity development so that residents can walk to a wide variety of commercial entertainment and civic uses in the downtown and provide support for downtown businesses development should also create an attractive visual gateway when entering downtown from the west  overview of subdistrict character the intent of this to describe the desired character of the subdistrict and serve as a guide to developers and the city throughout the development process see below for more specificity on which items are required preferred discouraged and prohibited 1 building scale and intensity residential development in creekside neighborhood is intended to be more intensive than anywhere else in the city located at the foot of a tall bluff to the north this subdistrict can accommodate very tall buildings without blocking views of the river valley from existing neighborhoods highdensity residential on this site will support street level activity and pedestrianoriented uses and ensure the longterm vibrancy of the entire downtown figure 16186201 2 redevelopment and preservation opportunities the entire creekside neighborhood is currently vacant and under single ownership as a result rifle creek and highway 624 are the only constraints to development the entire district should be developed under a single master plan 3 primary land uses the creekside neighborhood should be comprised primarily of highdensity highquality residential development with some potential for commercial uses on the ground floor highquality lodging may be acceptable but all other freestanding commercial uses are prohibited given the importance of having increased residential densities in the downtown and this subdistricts unique ability to accommodate such densities 4 general design characteristics development within the creekside neighborhood should maximize the use of highquality building materials and should be oriented to take advantage of views of rifle creek and the colorado river horizontal building and other elements should be integrated into taller buildings to blend with background bluffs where possible buildings also should expose their sustainable components such as skylights integrated solar panels natural and local materials and similar features 5 relationship of development to street buildings in the creekside neighborhood should have a strong visual orientation to highway 624 even if their main entries are located toward the interior of the subdistrict buildings may be pulled up to the sidewalk or sites may have highly landscaped setbacks that provide sufficient buffering from the high traffic levels on highway 624 rifle creek should be embraced as a key site amenity with building elevations that relate to the creek by incorporating terraces and balconies oriented to the creek and footprints and stepbacks that maintain a comfortable pedestrian environment along the creekfront trail likewise upper floors should be oriented toward views of the creek and the colorado river services and backofhouse activities should be located between buildings and not between the buildings and the highway or rifle creek figure 16186202 6 parking parking needs in the creekside neighborhood will be significant and will likely require the development of several parking structures these structures should be fully integrated into the overall development by reflecting the highquality materials used on the principal buildings parking may be phased over time starting with welldesigned and screened surface lots that are eventually converted to structures however surface parking lots located between buildings and the highway should be minimized with the majority of parking placed toward the center of the subdistrict the proximity of transit stops should be closely evaluated as well as the inclusion of carshares shuttles or other methods that reduce the potential parking demands of residents 7 project review criteria the city will evaluate proposed projects in the creekside neighborhood subdistrict based on the following considerations in addition to all of the other standards contained in of this a does the project contribute to a positive city gateway experience putting forth a highquality image for the central business district b is the proposed level

subdistrict represents an opportunity to increase residential density adjacent to the historic core centennial park and the rifle creek trail the purpose of this subdistrict is to promote the revitalization of this area and to encourage the development of a highquality medium to highdensity pedestrianoriented downtown neighborhood  overview of subdistrict character the intent of this to describe the desired character of the subdistrict and serve as a guide to developers and the city throughout the development process see below for more specificity on which items are required preferred discouraged and prohibited 1 building scale and intensity the centennial neighborhood is intended to consist of medium to highdensity high quality residential development in the form of townhomes apartments and condominiums with some opportunities for compatible commercial uses in mixeduse buildings or smallscale freestanding structures all buildings should have a pedestrianresidential scale and a strong relationship to the adjoining street grid to encourage residents to walk into the more commercialoriented districts of the downtown 2 redevelopment and preservation opportunities the centennial neighborhood offers many opportunities for redevelopment projects by assembling marginal singlefamily home sites and the redevelopment or outright replacement of existing marginal multifamily buildings and commercial properties although the 2008 downtown master plan did not identify any highpriority preservation sites in this subdistrict there are some singlefamily homes with historic characteristics that are in good shape that should be preserved onsite or relocated to other residential neighborhoods in the community these homes also may be candidates for appropriate conversion to commercial uses or livework units figure 16187201 3 primary land uses the centennial neighborhood should consist primarily of moderate to higherdensity residential uses complemented by some smallscale commercial development although the scale and density of buildings should be scaled to pedestrians and reflective of a residential neighborhood it is equally important that the residential density in this subdistrict is not so low that opportunities are missed to add needed residents to the downtown that support downtown businesses 4 general design characteristics new development within the centennial neighborhood should be characterized by traditional brick and wood frame building materials with articulated facades that maintain the residential character of the neighborhood larger assembled parcels should be designed to preserve the historic street grid pattern including the alleys where appropriate with primary building entries placed along the eastwest streets within the district however site plans also should orient and draw residents to rifle creek and centennial park where they adjoin the development 5 relationship of development to street in keeping with the residential character of the district modest front yards should be provided where possible porches and balconies are desirable additions that will help strengthen the orientation of the buildings toward the street figure 16187202 6 parking onstreet parking provided throughout the centennial neighborhood should primarily serve visitors onsite parking should be located to the sides and rear of buildings and never between buildings and a primary street resident parking may include wellscreened surface lots private garages or underground structures located beneath the buildings proximity to transit stops should be closely evaluated and the inclusion of carshares or other methods of reducing auto needs should be considered 7 project review criteria the city will evaluate proposed projects in the centennial neighborhood subdistrict based on the following considerations in addition to all of the other standards contained in of this a does the project take appropriate advantage of site assembly opportunities b does the project contribute to the revitalization of this neighborhood c does the project preserve the residential character of this area d is the proposed level of density consistent with the opportunities presented by the site and the need to increase residential development in the downtown e does the project take appropriate advantage of its proximity to centennial park f if a commercial use is being proposed is the use and its locationconfiguration compatible with the residential neighborhood character  site design standards the

that adequate parking is provided to cover the needs of downtown businesses residents and visitors while also ensuring that the central business district can be developed to its fullest this requires careful balancing and a high level of creativity on the part of developers property owners businesses residents and the city all parties must look for ways to address parking needs wide variety of costeffective solutions while maintaining an attractive pedestrianfriendly area accordingly large surface parking areas are discouraged and parking partnerships are strongly encouraged approaches  applicability a subdistricts and conflicts this division shall apply within all central business district subdistricts where the site development regulations of a particular subdistrict conflict with the regulations of this division the subdistrict regulations shall prevail likewise several cross references to the standards in parking and loading are contained herein where the regulations in that with this division the regulations of this division shall prevail b new development the offstreet parking and loading standards of this division shall apply to any new building and to any new land use established c expansions the offstreet parking and loading standards of this division shall apply when an existing structure or use is expanded additional offstreet parking and loading spaces shall be required to serve only the expanded area d change in use no additional offstreet parking shall be required for any change of use except in the case of a change from one 1 nonconforming nonresidential use to another as per d of this in which case the planning and zoning commission may impose parking requirements as deemed appropriate and necessary to adequately accommodate the needs of the new use  parking and loading requirements a exemptions 1 the first five thousand 5000 gross square feet of nonresidential use shall be exempt from all offstreet parking and loading requirements parking for such buildings is intended to be absorbed by onstreet parking and public parking facilities throughout the central business district a parking requirements contained in this division shall apply only to nonresidential portions of buildings larger than five thousand 5000 gross square feet and to residential uses b for purposes of this division the first five thousand 5000 gross square feet shall be that nonresidential area with the highest parking requirement as per 2 residential uses of any size or type are exempt from having to provide any offstreet parking for guests b alternatives for developing parking calculations for buildings with more than five thousand 5000 gross square feet of nonresidential uses and all residential uses the applicant may propose and the city may accept at its discretion any one 1 of the following three 3 alternatives for determining the number of offstreet parking and loading spaces to be provided 1 the standards listed in of this standard shall represent both the minimum and maximum number of offstreet parking spaces permitted  or 2 a blended ratio of one 1 parking space per two hundred fifty 250 gross square feet  or 3 for buildings with any land use or combination of uses the applicant may prepare a projectspecific parking demand analysis in accordance with c city acceptance the city reserves the right to accept accept with conditions or deny any proposal for an alternative number of offstreet parking spaces or loading spaces regardless of the method or findings of a parking analysis in no case however shall the city require more parking than that required in paragraph b1 or 2 above whichever is less in order to further the purpose and intent of this division the city may prepare its own parking demand analysis in accordance with below for any project exceeding fifteen thousand 15000 gross square feet should the applicant not elect to prepare one of his or her own  parking and loading demand analysis a demand analysis content where a parking and loading demand analysis is prepared to determine the number of required parking spaces as per paragraph 1618930b3 above the analysis shall 1 be prepared by a credentialed professional in the area of analyzing parking demand using a professionally accepted methodology such as that provided by the institute of traffic engineers and that takes into consideration local automobile usage patterns rather than relying solely on national standards or patterns 2 be specific to the proposed uses and site conditions and describe in detail the methodology used to prepare the analysis including all calculations and assumptions used 3 include a description of any and all strategies being used by the applicant to reduce parking demand also see b below where a strategy relies on some form of ongoing operation such as the provision of a community car shuttle bus shared parking between different property owners etc the method of guaranteeing continuous service shall be indicated where existing public transit is used as part of a strategy a guarantee of future service shall not be required 4 include a comparison of the parking space requirements under of this the proposed number of parking spaces b reduction strategies applicants are encouraged to explore a variety of strategies for reducing parking demand including but not limited to the following 1 shared parking onsite this strategy works well in projects with a mix of uses that have different peak times the strategy also may be employed with multiphase projects where the parking requirements are recalculated with each phase to realize efficiencies as more uses are added 2 shared parking offsite a shared parking agreement between two 2 or more different projectproperty owners can be an effective method of reaching larger economies of scale to reduce the overall parking requirements of the individual projects the agreement shall be prepared in a form acceptable to the city attorney and recorded prior to the issuance of a building permit for any of the properties involved the agreement shall be in effect for the life of the project or other time frame as agreed to by the city and the city shall be included as an interested party to the agreement such that the agreement cannot be amended or terminated without city approval 3 public transit larger developments that are likely to draw employees andor visitors from outside of the city and that include transit stops within the project may be able to realize parking reductions all proposed transit stops shall be approved by the transit provider 4 provision of a community or company car this strategy may work for larger residential or employment projects if used the applicant will be required to provide some form of guarantee that the community or company car will be provided on a continuous basis for the life of the project or other time frame as agreed to by the city 5 provision of a shuttle bus this too may be an acceptable strategy for larger residential or employment projects or for multiple projects that share in the cost again some form of guarantee will be required that service will be provided on a continuous basis for the life of the project or other time frame as agreed to by the city 6 deed restrictions deed restrictions that limit the number of cars occupants may have at a project may be an effective strategy particularly for residential units the form of the deed restriction shall be subject to approval by the city and the city shall be included as an interested party to the restriction such that the restriction cannot be removed without city approval c fee in lieu of onsite parking should the city create a more formal parking system and accept fees in lieu of onsite parking applicants are strongly encouraged to consider this option the ratio of onsite spaces to those to be provided by the city shall be determined by the city on a projectbyproject basis based on a variety of considerations including the location of the project location of the cityprovided parking types of project land uses existing parking demands in the area of the project and future parking demands in the area of the project among others d parking location for nonresidential land uses required offstreet parking spaces may be located anywhere in the central business district parking for residential uses shall be provided within six hundred 600 feet from the primary entrance to the residential structure or in the case of multiple structures or multiple entrances to the center of the project site  parking and loading report all projects that require offstreet parking shall submit as part of their application a parking report that includes
