include but are not limited to the local government purchasing program sometimes referred to as swop4g a separate program office of state purchasing part of the ohio department of 1523 administrative services pursuant to revised a program arranged by the ohio department of transportation c as part of any such cooperative purchasing program the city manager may agree that the city shall be bound by all contract terms and conditions prescribed by that program including but not limited to payment of a reasonable fee by the city to cover the administrative costs incurred by the program officials as a result of purchases by the city of kettering the city manager may agree under this procedure that the city will pay the vendor directly for items received by the city construction contracts as a

limited to ohio revised  932 933 1214 1535052 15354 15356 15357  and other applicable sections within rc 153 instead in addition to fulfilling the requirements of this as to contracts and purchases the city manager is authorized to use such further procedures for construction contracts public improvements and design contracts as he deems to be in the best interests of this city cross reference see 15202 e regarding change orders on construction contracts blanket purchase orders a a blanket purchase order is not based upon and does not constitute a contract obligating the city to purchase certain materials or services instead such a blanket order merely allows or permits a series of routine and repetitive purchases of supplies materials utility service or other items from a named supplier up to the dollar figure stated in that order but does not obligate the city to make any amount of purchases whatsoever such a purchase order when issued and approved as required by this section constitutes authority for city departments to make occasional purchases from that supplier without need for additional authorization from the city council city manager or the department of finance b before any blanket purchase order is issued it must be requested on a written document signed by the appropriate department director c a blanket purchase order may be approved under this section for purchases totaling less than $2500000 as long as the funds have been lawfully appropriated for that purpose and are in the treasury or in the process of collection to the credit of the appropriate fund free from previous and then outstanding obligations or 1524 certifications the finance director shall sign a certification to that effect upon each blanket purchase order and each such purchase order also shall be signed by the purchasing manager d a blanket purchase order may be issued for purchases totaling $2500000 or more but only on the basis of a separate resolution or ordinance of approval passed by the city council to the extent such approval is otherwise required by dealing with purchases and contracts for such blanket order so authorized by the city council the funds must also have been lawfully appropriated for that purpose and are in the treasury or in the process of collection to the credit of the appropriate fund free from previous and then outstanding obligations or certifications the finance director shall sign a certification to that effect upon each blanket purchase order and each such purchase order also shall be signed by the purchasing manager e because blanket purchase orders are not used to set prices but instead merely establish the terms of purchase applicable as small amounts of the supplies materials services etc are purchased from time to time during the year at thenexisting prices the use of competitive bargaining procedures is not a prerequisite to issuance of such blanket orders f the amount of time for which a blanket purchase order is to remain in effect shall be stated in that order and may not exceed twelve months nor the end of the fiscal year whichever occurs sooner g while the blanket purchase order is in effect every separate purchase under it must be authorized in writing by the appropriate department head through this section of the codified ordinances each such department head shall be deemed to hold delegated authority from the city manager to bind the city to implementations of blanket purchase orders kettering local preference a when using formal sealed bidding or competitive bargaining to

terms red and blue are primarily describing hue saturation refers to a colors richness a good way to imagine this is to think of saturation as pure color pigment added to a can of gray paint the more pigment added the richer or more intense the color brightness deals with a colors ability to reflect light we percieve this as the amount of white or black present in a color an example pink would be

following factors shall be considered and weighed by the board in determining practical difficulty 1 whether special conditions and circumstances exist that are peculiar to the land or structure involved and that are not applicable generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district  examples of such special conditions or circumstances are exceptional irregularity narrowness shallowness of the lot steepness of the lot or adjacency to non tip the crux of any request for a variance is the existence of physical features that are unique to a particular parcel or lot that preclude an owner from using their property in a manner similar to other properties in the same zoning district the idea is that the lot existed with specific physical conditions prior to the imposition of the zoning requirements the provisions of the zoning code may be appropriate for most lots within the district but limit the development of the affected lot to the point of practical difficulty these physical conditions are present in such a location or in such quantity that the property cannot be developed in compliance with district standards the property owner is entitled to reasonable use of their property the city is entitled to protection of valued features such as required yards and open space and to development that complies with local ordinances the variance may be the means to balance these potentially conflicting entitlements however many variance requests are not the result of such purposes often the property owner wishes to achieve a particular design and is unable to do so because of some physical aspect of the property alternate designs are possible but do not meet the property owners preferences or may not yield the best economic return it is inappropriate to grant such variances city of kettering zoning code chapter 1153  chapter 1153 procedures & enforcement conforming and inharmonious uses structures or conditions  2 whether the
