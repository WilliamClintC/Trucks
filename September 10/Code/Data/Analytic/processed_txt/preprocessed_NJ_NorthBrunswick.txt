hazard areas of township of north brunswick are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored cause damage in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss  1803 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of

dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  d controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e preventing or regulating the

purpose 114 editors note this ordinance also provided that should  205761b be adjudged invalid by the courts this entire section shall be deemed invalid  205753 north brunswick code  205761  1 the township of north brunswick strongly supports the concepts of smart growth and sustainability in order to promote these concepts the township has determined to provide the option for the development of a transitoriented mixeduse development within the i2 industrial zone district just south of cozzens lane adams lane this development will have to meet the standards set forth in  205761b of this chapter such development will provide concentrated mixeduse development at residential densities and with nonresidential floor areas that are compatible with both commuter bus service and rail transportation in this regard the township of north brunswick strongly supports the location of a new jersey transit train station in the transitoriented mixeduse development and the township of north brunswick further strongly supports all required transit improvement and roadway work related to the proposed train station both within the transitoriented mixeduse development and off site from the transitoriented mixeduse development which may include but not be limited to the proposed new jersey transit rail turn back loop at black horse lane and a proposed new route 1 to route 130 eastwest connector roadway proposed to be located between adams lane and black horse lane 2 given the current state of the economy and the sagging retail climate the township believes that large retail establishments are the necessary catalyst or economic engine to bring the transitoriented mixeduse development to fruition as a result these development regulations permit large retail establishments to represent a high proportion of the nonresidential development in the transitoriented mixeduse development 3 however retail centers that include large retail establishments with individual users occupying in excess of 50000 square feet typically have several uninspiring design features in common a nofrill site plans that eschew connection to the surrounding community and environs b plain vanilla standardized rectangular singlestory buildings c monolithic smoothsurface block facades d recognizable corporate color schemes e minimal architectural details f massive asphalt parking lots covering several acres g limited landscaping h few pedestrian amenities 4 while the township supports smart growth the township of north brunswicks vision for this mixeduse transitoriented development  205761 housing preservation and  205761  differs significantly from this standardized mediocrity as a result the township is enacting formbased guidelines that will require the large retail establishments to relate better to the community and have less negative impact upon the environment this will be achieved the large retail establishments into the fabric of the development and the surrounding community 5 the intent of the regulations incorporated herein is to bring pedestrians and bicyclists into the site and to allow them to maneuver safely throughout the site from store to store to the future train station and bus depot and to public spaces on a series of interconnected pedestrian pathways as a result of these regulations large retail establishments will incorporate pedestrianscale features into the design of their buildings and the parking lots that surround them in effect large retail establishments shall become a part of the main street environment as opposed to clashing with the main street environment b application of transitoriented mixeduse development overlay regulations 1 in addition to the principal conditional and accessory uses permitted in the i2 industrial zone district the owner of a tract within the i2 industrial zone district which meets the requirements set forth below shall have the option of developing that tract with a transitoriented mixeduse development should the owner of a tract within the i2 industrial zone district elect to develop its tract with a transitoriented mixeduse development then the use bulk and design standards of this section  205761 shall supersede the otherwise applicable provisions of only tracts meeting all of the standards set forth below can be developed with a transitoriented mixeduse development if a tract does not meet each of the standards below then the standards of  205761 shall not be applicable and large retail establishments general retail use hotels and residential uses shall continue to be prohibited uses in the zone these necessary requirements are a the tract shall be located within the i2 industrial zone district b the tract shall be a minimum of 200 contiguous acres in area c the site plan or general development plan for the transitoriented mixeduse development on the tract shall provide a location for a bus depot with associated parking and a new jersey transit train station with associated parking d the plan for the development of a transitoriented mixeduse development on the tract shall incorporate all offtract roadway improvements necessary to meet the travel time delay performance standards established by the planning board as  205761 north brunswick code  205761  critical to exercising the option to build under the overlay zoning standards  the planning board authorized a traffic study to determine what types of offtract traffic improvements would have to be constructed in close proximity to the site in order for the planning board to recommend the rezoning of the property to allow for the option to build a transitoriented mixeduse development the traffic study also factored in trips to be generated from a proposed large retail establishment of approximately 100000 square feet in building area on the southbound side of route 1 directly across from the proposed transitoriented mixeduse development this study prepared by maser consulting and referred to herein as the maser study broke the proposed transitoriented mixeduse development down into two phases known as phase 1 and the final build phase the maser study recommended specific roadway improvements to accommodate the phase 1 and the final build phase development the summary of recommended developer improvements for site rezoning of the maser study identifies the improvements necessary to satisfy the planning boards requirement that the development of a transitoriented mixeduse development would actually improve traffic congestion in proximity to the site for phase 1 development these improvements also account for the proposed large retail establishment of approximately 100000 square feet in building area on the southbound side of route 1 directly across from the proposed transitoriented mixeduse development  the maser study states gradeseparated interchanges may be required at the route 1 intersections of finnegans lane commerce boulevard and cozzensadams lane along with a possible reverse jughandle at aaron road the maser study shows conceptual designs of how such gradeseparated interchanges may occur to accommodate the train station and the final build phase the final determination of the need for these gradeseparated interchanges and the specific design of same would be determined by the njdot in conjunction with new jersey transit corporations commitment to locate a train station adjacent to the site  while the ultimate approval authority for some of the offtract improvements recommended in the maser study is the state department of transportation andor the county of middlesex the maser study provides clear analysis and recommendations relative to the type of improvements  205761 housing preservation and  205761  necessary to meet the planning boards criteria realizing that the state andor county may require modifications to the recommendations in the maser study it is the clear intention of the planning board that the developer may only exercise the option to construct phase 1 of the transitoriented mixeduse development by complying with 1da b or c below as part of its application for phase 1  the developer may only exercise the overlay district option to construct the final build phase of the transitoriented mixeduse development upon satisfying the implementation of the recommended final build improvements described in the maser study in conjunction with the construction of a train station or by adhering to the standards of 1dc below a the developer shall build 100% of the improvements with the exclusion of the farside jughandle on route 1 northbound at aaron road recommended in of the maser study under summary of recommended developer improvements for site rezoning and be responsible for 100% of the cost of said improvements subject to modification by the state or county if the development of the transitoriented mixeduse development proceeds to construction and the large retail establishment proposed on the southbound side of route 1 does not proceed to construction  or b the developer shall build 100% of the improvements recommended in of the maser study under summary of recommended developer improvements for site rezoning and be responsible for a proportionate share of the cost subject to modification by the state or county if the development of the large retail establishment on the southbound side of route 1 proceeds to construction in a similar time frame to the transitoriented mixeduse development said proportionate distribution of cost shall be based upon external trips generated by each development as specifically enumerated in table 19 of the maser study  or c prior to filing an initial application with the planning board or filing any request for amendment to a previously obtained approval the developer may submit an alternative traffic analysis or revised project gross floor area and submit revised roadway improvement plans to the planning board in an attempt to demonstrate that modifications to the  205761 north brunswick code  205761  recommended roadway improvements will satisfy the planning board relative to travel time delays said alternate plans may result from consultation with the njdot middlesex county njdep new jersey transit or any other governmental agency or from changes necessitated by environmental utility or rightofway constraints or for any other reason that would render the specific maser study recommendations unfeasible or impractical to implement or for any other reason should the planning board determine by resolution that it will accept alternative improvement plans said alternative improvement plans shall be detailed within the resolution and said resolution shall supplement or supersede the offtract improvement standards incorporated in the maser study failure to provide for the offtract improvements standards incorporated in the maser study b2d or  above or this 2d or as amended and approved by the planning board herein shall result in the application for a transitoriented mixeduse development being classified as a nonpermitted use thereby causing the planning board to lack jurisdiction over the application e the transitoriented mixeduse development shall be designed so that a minimum of 10% of all energy projected to be consumed on the tract as determined by the estimated energy demand is generated from renewable sources inclusive of but not limited to geothermal wind fuel cell solar or any other renewable technology f no more than 370000 square feet of the retail floor area of the transitoriented mixeduse development shall be located in freestanding onestory retail buildings the number of freestanding large retail establishments shall be limited to two

determined by engineering standards to achieve such coverage  and c the federal telecommunications act of 1996 fta preserves local zoning authority to reasonably regulate personal wireless telecommunications facilities pwtfs  but the fta mandates that localities may not unreasonably discriminate among fcc license holders and that localities cannot prohibit or adopt regulations which have the effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless services and the fta gives the fcc sole jurisdiction over radio frequency emissions of pwtfs so long as pwtfs meet fcc standards  and d it is

205160 overall objective the overall objective of this article is to allow the provision of personal wireless communications services which have been determined by the telecommunications act to be necessary and protected to provide full and seamless communication services while simultaneously limiting the number of telecommunications pwtfs and pwtefs to the fewest possible as reasonably practicable and only in those locations which do not negatively impact upon the prevailing visual character of the township of north brunswick because the telecommunications act has recognized that service carriers have the right to provide cellular communication service within municipalities it is also the objective of this article that many of the different carriers locate their antennas on the same telecommunications tower to limit the overall number of telecommunications towers within the township of north brunswick to the extent reasonably practicable a the purpose of this article is to provide sound land use policies procedures regulations and specific zoning conditions for pwtfs and pwtefs to protect the township of north brunswick from the visual or other adverse impacts of these facilities and to safeguard the public good health safety and welfare and preserve the intent and the purposes of the township of north brunswicks master plan and land use encouraging the unobtrusive development of pwtfs and pwtefs to provide comprehensive wireless telecommunications services in the township of north brunswick to benefit its residents and businesses this article expresses a preference that telecommunications providers locate antennas on existing buildings and telecommunications towers or that any pwtfs and pwtefs be constructed on municipal or other priority locations as set forth herein  and further encourages collocation and site sharing of new and existing pwtfs and pwtefs this article seeks to meet the mandate of the telecommunications act of 196 while simultaneously seeking to limit the proliferation of telecommunications towers and appurtenances b it is understood by the township of north brunswick that the federal government fcc  issues licenses for personal wireless communications and that the fcc requires license holders to provide coverage within the areas so licensed c it is also understood by the township of north brunswick that the fta expressly preserves the zoning authority of a municipality to regulate the placement construction and modification of pwtefs subject to the six limitations cited at  332c7b of the fta accordingly the fta does not abrogate local zoning authority in favor of the commercial desire to offer optimal service to all current and potential customers and the providers of the personal wireless services must bear the burden of proving that any proposed service facility is the least intrusive means of filling a significant gap in personal wireless communications services in a given area  205159 housing preservation and  205161   205161 specific goals the specific goals of this article are  205162 exemptions this article shall not apply to any telecommunications tower or the

the construction of structures or improvements on areas which previously contained structures or other improvements steep slopes  any slope equal to or greater than 20% as measured over any minimum run of 10 feet steep slopes are determined based on contour intervals of two feet or less  205179 designation of areas the percent of slope rise in feet per horizontal distance shall be established by measurement of distance perpendicular to the contour of the a the purpose of this article is to regulate the intensity of use in areas of steeply sloping terrain in order to limit soil loss erosion excessive stormwater runoff the degradation of surface water and to maintain the natural topography and drainage patterns of land b disturbance of steep slopes results in accelerated erosion processes from stormwater runoff and the subsequent sedimentation of waterbodies with the associated degradation of water quality and loss of aquatic life support related effects include soil loss changes in natural topography and drainage patterns increased flooding potential further fragmentation of forest and habitat areas and compromised aesthetic values it has become widely recognized that disturbance of steep slopes should be restricted or prevented based on the impact disturbance of steep slopes can have on water quality and quantity and the environmental integrity of landscapes
