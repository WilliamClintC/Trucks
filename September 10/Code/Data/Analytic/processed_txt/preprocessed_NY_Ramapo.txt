consistent and generally associated with a court officer in the state of new york including but not necessarily limited to a the town of ramapo justice court like most local town and village courts throughout the state conducts its actual courtroom sessions both criminal and civil on a regular but generally less than fulltime schedule as such the court does not require fulltime courtroom security or the personnel costs associated with a staff of fulltime court security officers that fact notwithstanding the need for armed security personnel in and about local courtrooms in order to ensure that weapons and other contraband that could pose a significant and imminent danger not only to court personnel but to those members of the public who have business before the court is more apparent today than ever before relatively minor matters between parties have been seen to erupt into violence in our courtrooms  and recently in one local rockland county village court a spectator secreted a firearm into the courtroom and discharged it nearly striking the sitting justice b the use of fulltime police officers for courtroom security is not only costly but takes trained officers

known as the ramapo best value contract award law  512 legislative intent a general municipal law  103 provides local governments greater flexibility in awarding contracts including contracts for service work on the basis of best value the state legislation requires municipalities with a population of less than $1000000 to pass a local law authorizing the use of the best value award process b enactment of this legislation provides additional procurement options to localities in ways that may expedite the procurement process and result in cost savings the best value standard for selecting goods and service vendors including janitorial and security contracts is critical to efforts to use strategic sourcing principles to modernize the supply chain and ensure that taxpayers obtain the highest quality goods and services at the lowest potential cost while also ensuring fairness to all competitors c with the increased complexity of the goods and services that municipalities must obtain in order to serve taxpayers it is critical to consider selection and evaluation criteria that measure factors other than cost in the strictest sense d taxpayers are not well served when a public procurement results in low unit costs at the outset but ultimately engenders cost escalations due to factors such as inferior quality poor reliability and difficulty of maintenance best value procurement links the procurement process directly to the municipalitys performance requirements incorporating selection factors such as useful lifespan quality and options to incentives for more timely performance andor additional services e even if the initial expenditure is higher considering the total value over the life of the procurement may result in a better value and longterm investment of public funds best value procurement also encourages competition and in turn often results in better pricing quality and customer service fostering healthy competition ensures that bidders will continue to strive for excellence in identifying and meeting municipalities needs including such important goals as the participation of small minority and womenowned businesses and the development of environmentally preferable goods and service delivery methods best value procurement will provide muchneeded flexibility in obtaining important goods and services at favorable prices and will reduce the time to procure such goods and services  511 general provisions  513   513 definitions as used in this article the following terms shall have the meanings indicated best value  the

for the award is best value documentation in the procurement record shall where practicable include quantification of the application of criteria to the rating of proposals and the evaluation results

statement of purpose a it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 regulate uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damages  5 regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and 6 qualify and maintain for participation in the national flood insurance program  14440 ramapo code  1493   1494 definitions b objectives the objectives of this chapter are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize

including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species c clearing and grading during construction tend to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality g stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities h the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety i regulation of land development

zoning district maximum 12 units per acre 2 the town board held initially held a public hearing on the petitions in 201 at which time it considered potential amendments to the 2004 comprehensive plan and the town zoning map thereafter required preparation of an environmental impact statement on the proposed action accepted a draft environmental impact statement and held public hearings on a proposed local law comprehensive plan amendments and the deis on  accepted a final environmental impact statement referred the proposed zoning amendments to the rockland county planning department and the town planning board for their recommendations and held public hearings on a revised local law revised comprehensive plan amendments and a technical addendum to the feis on  at which hearing and during the following written comment period it received public comment on the revised local law revised comprehensive plan amendments the feis and the technical addendum thereto on considering the comments ofthe public and involved and interested agencies the reports of the county planning department and town planning board as well as the advice of its planning consultants the town board thereafter directed revisions to the proposed comprehensive plan and zoning amendments 3 the town board has adopted in its capacity as seqra lead agency its seqra findings statement setting forth its findings with respect to the environmental review of the proposed seqra action and alternatives thereto and has considered therein the recommendation of its consulting planner that certain properties being considered for rezoning should retain their existing zoning 4 having studied the proposed rezoning action including the petitions proposed amendments to the town s 2004 comprehensive plan to reflect current conditions in the area of the town that would be rezoned a conceptual development plan known as pascack ridge and the environmental review documents prepared in connection with that action the town board finds that the proposed rezoning revised to exclude those parcels identified by its consulting planner is reasonable and appropriate to respond to the growth of the town s

meet the town s housing needs 6 the town board finds that the revised local law which excludes certain parcels that were considered for rezoning from being rezoned due to size location and constraints that indicate they are not suitable for development of multifamily housing and would therefore be rendered nonconforming parcels if they were subject to the mr 12 zoning regulations to be entirely
