aevaluation of plan effectiveness 1in order to maintain the effectiveness and sustainability of the water shortage response plan it is imperative to maintain accurate water use records water use records should be collected and monitored prior to during and after implementation of conservation restrictions 2in evaluating the effectiveness of the water shortage response plan the public works director will compare historical use data to determine if the reduction amount is accurate if reduction amounts are inadequate the wsrp should be updated with further conservation restrictions and triggers that initiate water conservation requirements earlier 3the public works director will monitor the frequency that the wrsp conservation restrictions are implemented and recommend revisions to the governing board to correct for inappropriate water restrictions 4the public works director will monitor the water transmission system and water use records to determine if events outside of the scope of the wsrp require implementation of the water conservation methods in the wsrp the triggers activating water conservation restrictions should be updated to reflect these observations 5the public works director will record citations and violations of the water conservation requirements if citations and violation numbers are excessive the wsrp may be revised to show additional public

prior to an adoption vote by the town council  cross connection control   purpose of policy the purpose of this policy statement is to articulate and adopt an official policy that will establish a cross connection control policy for the town the policy will aensure that the towns potable public water supply is protected from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within each consumers water system such contaminants waterborne health hazards and other significant pollutants which could backflow into the public water systems bensure that existing cross connections actual or potential between the consumers potable water systems and nonpotable water systems plumbing fixtures and industrial piping systems are eliminated or controlled cprovide an inspection program of cross connection control which will systematically and effectively control all actual or potential cross connections which may be installed in the future    coverage this policy upon adoption by the town council shall be applicable to all water system customers of the town that are served by the towns public water distribution system until such time as the policy statement is altered modified or rescinded by the town council    policy athis policy defines the town of edenton as the water purveyor in the elimination of all cross connections within its public potable water supply bthe cross connection control program which is based on the cross connection control ordinance and on this policy shall ensure that after the effective date of the cross connection control ordinance 1that all new residential and nonresidential water services requiring water from the towns public water system shall have an appropriate backflow prevention device installed prior to water service activation

a situation that occurs when on the effective date of this chapter an existing lot or structure or use of an existing lot or structure does not conform to one or more of the regulations applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is located among other possibilities a nonconforming situation may arise because a lot does not meet minimum acreage requirements  town of edenton unified

authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming except that a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the lot eg a sand pit may be expanded to the boundaries of the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming if ten percent or more of the earth products had already been removed on the effective date of this chapter d the volume intensity or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other paragraphs of this section occur e notwithstanding subsection a any structure used for singlefamily residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or

considerations 1 all expenditures made to obtain or pursuant to a validly issued and unrevoked building zoning sign or special or conditional use permit shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this chapter became effective 2 except as provided in subdivision b1 no expenditures made more than 180 days before the effective date of this chapter may be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this chapter became effective an expenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure 3 to the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures for example a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditure to acquire a potential development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new classification as it was under the old for the expenditure can be recovered by a resale of the property 4 to the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of a conforming project a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made such expenditures 5 an expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant both in dollar amount and in terms of i the total estimated cost of the proposed project and ii the ordinary business practices of the developer 6 a person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting the proposed development site could not be attributed to him 7 even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting a development site the permit issuing authority may still find that he acted in good faith if he did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate  town of edenton unified development 99 88 attempt to circumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance the permit issuing authority may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to undermine the proposed ordinance if it determines that i at the time the expenditures were made either there was considerable doubt about whether any ordinance would ultimately be passed or it was not clear that the proposed ordinance would prohibit the intended development and ii the developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures 8 in deciding whether a permit should be issued under this section the permit issuing authority shall not be limited to either denying a permit altogether or issuing a permit to complete the project or phases sections or stages thereof as originally proposed or approved upon proper submission of plans by the applicant the permit issuing authority may also issue a permit authorizing a development that is less nonconforming than the project as originally proposed or approved but that still does not comply with all the provisions of the ordinance making the project nonconforming c when it appears from the developers plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in phases stages segments or other discrete units the developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the developer can make the showing required under subsection b ln addition to the matters and subject to the guidelines set forth in subdivisions 1 6 of subsection b the permit issuing authority shall in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project consider the following in addition to other relevant factors 1 whether any plans prepared or approved regarding uncompleted phases constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying architectural or engineering work 2 whether any improvements such as streets or utilities have been installed in phases not yet completed 3 whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed in such a manner or location or such a scale in anticipation of connection to or interrelationship with approved but uncompleted phases that the investment in such utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if such approved but uncompleted phases are constructed in conformity with existing regulations d the permit issuing authority shall not consider any application for the permit authorized by

permit a special use permit shall nevertheless be required if the administrator finds that the proposed use would have an extraordinary impact on neighboring properties or the general public in making this determination the administrator shall consider among other factors whether the use is proposed for an undeveloped or previously developed lot whether the proposed use constitutes a change from

according to their different impacts whenever an activity which may or may not be separately listed as a principal use in this table is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use i constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot or ii is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use for example a swimming pool tennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential subdivision or multifamily development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal uses even though such facilities if developed apart from a residential development would require a special use permit amended 199 town of edenton unified development 2398 103 b for purposes of interpreting subsection a 1 a use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to the principal use  2 to be commonly associated with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not but only that the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness c without limiting the generality of subsections a and b the following activities are specifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses so long as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above 1 offices or studios within an enclosed building and used by an occupant of a residence located on the same lot as such building to carry on administrative or artistic activities of a commercial nature so long as such activities do not fall within the definition of a home occupation 2 hobbies or recreational activities

right of way 3 neighborhood utility facilities located within a public right of way with the permission of the owner state or town of the right of way change in use a a substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character or nature of the activity conducted on a lot changes this occurs whenever 1 the change involves a change from one principal use category to another 2 if the original use is a combination use  the relative proportion of space devoted to the individual principal uses that comprise the combination use changes to such an extent that the parking requirements for the overall use are altered amended 199 3 if the original use is a combination use the mixture of types of individual principal uses that comprise the combination use changes 4 if the original use is a planned residential development the relative proportions of different types of dwelling units change 5 if there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot regardless of whether that business or enterprise consists of one individual principal use or a combination use that business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in even though the new business or enterprise may be classified under the same principal use or combination use category as the previous type of business for example if there is only one building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of that building moves out and is replaced by a clothing store that constitutes a change in use however if the florist shop were replaced by another florist shop that would not constitute a change in use since the type of business or enterprise would not have changed moreover if the florist shop moved out of a rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store that would not constitute a change in use since there is more than one business on the lot and the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot shopping centercombination use has not changed admended 199 b a mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or viceversa does not constitute a change in use whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than 180

architecturally integrated subdivision and twofamily or multifamily uses then the total density permissible on the entire tract shall be determined by dividing the area of the tract by the minimum

safety and general welfare therefore the town council of edenton north carolina does ordain as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of edenton are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards c purpose it is the purpose of this promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands d objectives the objectives of this to town of edenton unified development 99 162 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets

required a the council recognizes that due to the particularities of any given development the inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in e may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs the former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots the latter situation results in a waste of money as well as a waste of space that could more desirably be used for valuable development or environmentally useful open space

producers of oxygen a necessary element for human survival  2 trees appreciably reduce the everincreasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air we breathe  3 trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify the air much like the airwasher devices used on commercial air conditioning systems  4 trees have an important role in neutralizing waste water passing ground from the surface to ground water tables and lower aquifers  5 trees root systems stabilize the ground water tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation erosion control and flood control  6 trees are an invaluable physical aesthetic and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land reducing noise levels and glare and breaking the monotony of human developments on the land particularly parking areas  and 7 for the reasons indicated in subdivision 6 trees have an important impact on the desirability of land and therefore on property values town of edenton unified development 1999 196 b based upon the findings

process established in this section provides for the accommodation of such uses by reclassification of property into a conditional use district subject to specific conditions which ensure compatibility of the use with the surrounding area and enjoyment of the neighboring properties b the conditional use district rezoning process is established to address certain situations when particular uses future uses or unknown future uses may be acceptable but the general zoning district which allows that uses would be inappropriate at the particular locations in the absence of special conditions where the applicant for rezoning desires property to be rezoned to such a district in such situations the conditional use district classification will be considered only upon requestacceptance of the applicant for rezoning conditional use districts bearing the designation cu corresponds to an identical district for example a conditional use highway commerical district

and other such matters as the applicant may propose as conditions upon the request in the course of evaluating the proposed use the council may request additional information deemed appropriate to provide a complete analysis of the proposal this process allows rezoning requests and a conditional use permit applications to be processed at the same time however the governing bodies should treat the two proposals as legally independent separate decisions in granting a conditional use permit the town council may impose such additional reasonable and appropriate safeguards upon such permit as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of this section are served public welfare secured and substantial justice done the petitioner shall have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any such conditions prior to final action by the town council d the authorization of a conditional use permit in any cu district for any use which is allowed only as a special use in the zoning district which corresponds to the cu district shall preclude any requirements for obtaining a special use permit from any such use from the board of adjustment town of edenton unified

smaller than two feet in diameter b the best times for planting are early spring and early fall trees planted in the summer run the risk of dehydration c plant all trees at least threeandahalf feet from the end of headin parking spaces in order to prevent damage from car overhangs d dig the tree pit at least one foot wider than the root ball and at least six inches deeper than the balls vertical dimension e especially in areas where construction activity has compacted the soil the bottom of the pit should be scarified or loosened with a pick ax or shovel f after the pit is dug observe subsurface drainage conditions where poor drainage exists the tree pit should be dug at least an additional twelve inches and the soil amended to allow roots to grow properly g backfill should include a proper mix of soil and fertilizer all roots must be completely covered backfill should be thoroughly watered as it is placed around the roots h immediately after it is planted the tree should be supported with stakes and guy wires to firmly hold it in place as its root system begins to develop remove stakes and ties after one year i spread at least three inches of mulch over the entire excavation in order to retain moisture and keep down weeds an additional threeinch saucer of mulch should be provided to form a basin around the trunk of the tree this saucer helps catch and retain moisture j the lower trunks of new trees should be wrapped with burlap or paper to prevent evaporation and sun scald the wrapping should remain on the tree for at least a year k conscientious postplanting care especially watering pruning and fertilizing is a must for street and parking lot trees branches of new trees may be reduced by as much as a third to prevent excessive evaporation for

the health and appearance of public plantings in the town of edenton north carolina i selection and planting of street and park trees a time to plant most hardy trees and shrubs can be moved successfully in the fall or spring the fall planting season extends from the time the leaves begin to turn color until after the leaves have fallen octobernovember in edenton the spring planting season begins when the soil warms up and is dry enough to work and continues until growth starts march and april in edenton fall planting has the advantage of allowing the root system to grow in the late fall before top growth begins the following spring planting can be done to the likelihood of greater moisture stress b selection of specimens 1 what to look for when purchasing plants nurserygrown plants generally have better root and branch structure and become established more quickly than trees collected from fields or woods the quality of plants selected can be as important in determining their success in the landscape as proper selection of species planting and maintenance a young plant with structural defects may never thrive and produce a suitable specimen a healthy wellgrown nursery plant is a good investment the following factors should be considered when purchasing trees and shrubs a apparent health and vigorlive buds  no buds  no dried out wood  if in leaf normal color density and size of leaves b healthy root systemfree of kinks or circling roots  if in containers sufficient root volume to anchor plant but not pot bound c toptoroot ratiomoderate ratio of top growth to root system a small root system may not be able to support a large top d welltrained branch structurestraight trunk standing without support evenly distributed branches radially and vertically branches set as wide angles to the trunk  for vertically branches set at wide angles to the trunk  for shrubsevenly distributed branches and symmetry of growth e freedom from disease insect pests or mechanical injury 2 size of nursery stock town of edenton unified development 99 appendix f2 large shade trees are measured in caliper determined at 6 above the soil line for trees up to and including 4 in diameter tree caliper is measured 12 above the soil line for trees greater than 4 in diameter trees are classified by size in onefourth inch intervals up to 2 in diameter onehalf inch intervals up to 4 in diameter and 1 intervals over 4 in diameter for public plantings trees with a minimum one and onefourth inch to one and onehalf inch caliper are recommended trees of this size become established more quickly and are less subject to vandalism and accidental breakage than smaller plants trees over 4 caliper are not routinely recommended due to expense need for heavy equipment and extra longterm care required small trees are measure in height determined at one foot intervals up to 6 in height and two foot intervals over 6 plants of 68 size are recommended shrubs are measured in height or spread depending on their growth habit they are classified in groups with 3 increments up to 18 and in 6 increments over 18 in height or spread availability of various size grades depends somewhat on the species and its growth rate a size intermediate in the range of those available is recommended 3 types of nursery stock trees are handled bareroot roots free of soil and wrapped in moist packing moist packing material balled and burlapped dug with a ball of soil wrapped in burlap and tied or in containers dormant deciduous trees of less than 2 caliper may be available bareroot for fall or early spring planting some kinds of small deciduous trees most large trees and evergreens are moved balled and burlapped in the spring or fall many deciduous and evergreen trees are shrubs are now available at all times of the year in containers ranging from one 1 gallon to ten 10 gallons or more in size balled and burlapped and container grown plants tend to suffer less transplanting shock than plants moved bareroot c planting instructions 1 preplant care if planting can not be done immediately after plants are purchased they must be kept cool and moist bareroot plants should be heeledin by digging a trench in a shaded location large enough to accommodate the root system without crowding lay the tree roots in the trench and mound moist soil wood shavings or peat over the roots store balled and burlapped plants in the shade and keep the root ball moist take care not to break the root ball when moving the plants containergrown plants should be kept shaded and watered town of edenton unified development 99 appendix f3 2 preparing the planting hole a properly dug planting hole is roomy with good bottom drainage holes need be no deeper than needed to allow the plants crown to sit an inch or so above the surrounding soil level for bareroot trees make the hole wide enough to accommodate the roots when they are spread out naturally for balled and burlapped and container plants dig the hole twice the diameter of the root ball container loosen the soil on the bottom and sides of the hole to provide easier penetration of developing roots the soil dug from the planting hole is satisfactory fro backfilling around the roots if it is a welldrained average loam heavy clay soil or very sandy soil may benefit from thoroughly mixing organic matter compost damp peat with the backfill 3 planting care root plants a soak root system in water about twelve 12 hours b remove any broken or bruised roots c mound and firm the soil in the center of the planting hole to hold the crown of the plant up with the roots spread out naturally at about a 6 depth d holding the trunk so the previous soil line is 12 above finished ground level gradually fill and tamp soil around roots taking care not to break or bruise the roots and to avoid air pockets 4 planting balled and burlapped plants a carefully set the ball in the planting hole without cracking the ball of soil the ball should sit about an inch or two higher than the surrounding soil add backfill under the ball to bring to correct height b check that the ball is centered and the trunk aligned vertically c alternatively backfill and firm the soul halfway up the ball d loosen the twine and burlap from around the top and shoulder of the ball fold the burlap back into the hole or cut it off e finish filling the hole making sure the burlap is well buried 5 container plants a handle the plant by the container not the trunk b carefully remove the container cut it if necessary c loosen the root ball by hand or slit with a knife to provide good soil contact if roots are matted around the bottom and sides of the ball or circling the ball remove or straighten them removing as much as onehalf of the roots from the outer 1 of the ball should not harm the plant town of edenton unified development 99 appendix f4 d set the plant in the hole so that it sits an inch or two higher than the surrounding soil e alternately fill and firm the soil around the root ball 6 finishing the job a shape the soil on top of the hole to form a broad shallow saucer with the rim just inside the lip of the original hole b fill the basin slowly with the water water thoroughly c after the water has soaked in reshape the basin to make the base of the plant slightly higher than the bottom of the basin unless the soil has washed off the top of the root ball do not add soil over the root ball to obtain the desired basin shape d place 23 of mulch wood chips shredded bark etc over the basin and surrounding lip to reduce moisture loss moderate soil loss moderate soil temperature and reduce settling and cracking of the soil e fertilizer at planting is not necessary or recommended f see directions for pruning newly planted trees page f11 g staking is not always needed to make a tree stand upright but trees in public planting areas need to be staked to help them achieve good root anchorage and protect them from vehicles lawn mowers animals and vandals drive two or three 2 x 2 stakes one and onehalf feet deep into the soil just clear of the planting hole if wind is not a problem the stakes should be placed so as to provide maximum protection from traffic and equipment in moderate to strong wind situations an imaginary line drawn support stakes should be at right angles to the wind direction wire covered with hose or tubing to protect the trunk elastic webbing belting or polyethylene tape can be used for ties ties are located near the top of the stake and a figure eight loop is made between trunk and stake the ties should not be within two and onehalf feet from the top of the tree in order to avoid unnecessary stress on the trunk see figure 1 page f 14 ii annual maintenance a newly planted trees 1st and 2nd growing season after planting the first two years after planting are critical in the life of a tree for street trees they are particularly difficult because of the often less than ideal site conditions it is better to plant a smaller number of trees at one time with reasonable assurance of care for several years thereafter than to over plant and neglect them the following instructions pertain to trees but with the exception of stake and tie care apply equally well to shrub plantings seasonal care includes a minimum of two visits to each tree the first two growing seasons one in march and one in august town of edenton unified development 99 appendix f5 first season the following maintenance operations should be performed at each visit 1 check condition of mulch aerate loosen with pitchfork if tightly packed add new mulch to maintain 23 level 2 remove weeds and grass from mulched area these compete with the tree for water and increase the likelihood of mower damage to tree 3 check stakes and ties keep taut 4 prune off any broken branches in proper manner see where and how to make a pruning cut page f9 5 check health of plant including possible attack by insects and disease seek advice of extension agent for control measures 6 water thoroughly if needed deep watering is necessary to avoid shallow root systems and unstable trees additional watering should be done one a week whenever rainfall levels during the growing season are less than 1 per month second season same operations as first year except 1 remove stakes and ties unless trunk and root anchorage appear to be weak in which case leave stakes and ties one more year removing all wire and tie material is especially important to avoid its cutting into the bark and girdling the trunk 2 fertilize the tree just before new growth starts in the spring a fertilizer containing only nitrogen is sufficient for most new trees it can be applied to the soil surface in readily soluble form ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate at the rate of 1025 lbsq yd and watered in b established plants plants in the ground three of more years are usually considered established the following procedures for the maintenance of street and park plantings should be done each year 1 late winter to early spring a prune to train young plants for proper shape and branch structure see directions for newly planted and young trees  to avoid later problems and the need for heavy equipment it is wise to correct structural defects early in the life of a plant b apply fertilizer as needed to plants showing poor growth andor foliage color fertilize plants in restricted root zone areas eg downtown broad street annually see following section on fertilization c aerate and replenish mulch in park shrub borders d broadleaf weed control for lawn areas in parks e perform previously outlines spring maintenance for newly planted trees 2 midsummer town of edenton unified development 99 appendix f6 a water plants weekly in areas of restricted root space whenever rainfall is less than 1 per month water other trees and shrubs if signs of wilting occur b use poast or fusilade with a nonionic surfactant enduce agridex for grass control in shrub borders and for edging c check for insect and disease problem ask county extension agent for diagnosis and recommended control measures d prune hedges and shrubs to keep within bounds 3 late summer a prune out dead diseased and broken limbs according to recommended procedures see page f9 b remove excessive basel sucker growth and limb up street trees to provide proper clearance and sight distance 4 all seasons after storms cleanly prune stub ends of broken limbs within the crown of the tree back to the next largest branch broken and town stubs are prime decay entry points and lead to major problems if not cleanly pruned at the time of breakage c fertilization the extent to which fertilizers are applied to established plantings depends on the fertility of the soil in which they are growing if plants are making good growth and have good foliage color the soil is probably fertile enough on plantings showing signs of malnutrition fertilizer is best applied in the spring about the time buds are beginning to grow the results of a soil analysis can provide recommended treatment and application rates for general fertilization and micronutrients needs the following information contains broad guidelines for application methods and rates for various plantings 1 shrub beds a 5105 fertilizer may be broadcast on the beds at a rate of 25 lbs1000 sq feet  individual plants depending on size would receive 1 to 3 or 4 handfuls several application methods are used but some require specialized equipment for injection of fertilizer more common methods include surface broadcasting and soil incorporation in nonlawn areas surface application is the easiest and most effective method for nitrogen and micronutrient fertilizers the rate of application depends on tree size apply fertilizer starting two and onehalf feet from the trunk to a distance extending 2530% beyond the spread of the branches for trees up to 3 in diameter 5105 2 lbsinch trunk diameter 1064 1 lbinch trunk diameter town of edenton unified development 99 appendix f7 for trees over 3 in diameter 5105 5 lbinch trunk diameter 1064 3 lbinch trunk diameter if rate is indicated in excess of 20 lbs of 5105 or 10 lbs of 1064 in 100 square feet of surface area divide the fertilizer in two or more portions and apply at 46 week intervals when roads and sidewalks cover much of the surface area under the plant the rate of application should be reduced and the amount apportioned in several smaller applications for plants in lawn area soil incorporation is a more effective method of fertilizer application fertilizer is placed in holes bored in the soil to more directly place nutrients in the root zone area and avoid over fertilization of the lawn holes should be drilled with an auger or punched with a soil corer to avoid soil compaction resulting from merely pounding holes into the soul drill holes 1012 deep and 23 apart beginning away from the trunk to avoid injury to the main support roots continue drilling holes in a spiral pattern extending 2530% beyond the spread of the branches pour one 1 cup of 5105 or onehalf cup 1064 in each hole fill holes with water after water drains refill hole with good topsoil plants located in paved areas providing limited root space and little surface soil area benefit from annual fertilizer application micronutrient eg iron and zinc deficiencies may also be more common and require special attention spring surface application at a reduced rate is recommended for such plants slow release fertilizers are available which release small amounts of nutrients over 618 months these are often expensive and no more effective than other methods but may be used for plants that are difficult to reach for more regular fertilizations iii general pruning principles successful pruning requires knowledge of plant growth and development growth habits of different kinds of plants and an ability to mentally envision the future from of a given specimen it is not possible to provide directions for every situation that necessitates pruning the following are only general guidelines additional references should be consulted for further information of handling particular problems or plant species only with good pruning and training can the maximum aesthetic and functional benefit be acquired from plants a purposes of pruning one must have a clear purpose in mind before any pruning is done this purpose will dictate the time of pruning and the kind of cuts to be made valid reasons for pruning include 1 to train young plantsthe arrangement attachment and size of scaffold branches main structural branches can be controlled to produce vigorous and mechanically strong plants the early removal of crowded rubbing and crossing branches will eliminate later town of edenton unified development 99 appendix f8 problems pruning should take advantage of the plants natural growth habit 2 to maintain health and appearancepruning must be done to remove dead diseased and broken branches a dense top may be thinned to allow for passage of light and to reduce wind resistance 3 to control plant sizecontrol of plant height and spread may be needed to reduce interference with utility wires views and traffic initial selection of plants with a size and growth habit compatible with site conditions can minimize such pruning but existing plantings may require pruning to direct their growth in an appropriate manner 4 for safetythe safety of citizens and property must always be considered trees or branches that storm damage old pruning wounds or disease become sufficiently decayed internally to pose an imminent threat to people or property must be removed promptly b when to prune the correct time to prune depends of the type of plant its condition and the results desired some general rules are as follows 1 light pruning can be done anytime unwanted growth is most easily removed when it is small 2 broken dead weak or hazardous branches should be removed whenever they occur it is often more easy to see theses problems during the growing season 3 young plants are best trained during the dormant season from after leaf fall to before the period of rapid spring growth pruning at this time results in more rapid plant development and wound healing a few broadleaf evergreens grow most rapidly after the weather warms up in late spring and pruning should be delayed until spring growth occurs 4 control of plant growth is best achieved when pruning is done soon after growth is complete for the season such pruning should not be so severe or early to encourage new shoot growth in general mid to late summer pruning results in maximum growth reduction 5 trees and shrubs with desirable flowers should be pruned according to the time the plant blooms plants that bloom in spring should be pruned near the end of their blooming period plants that bloom in summer or fall should be pruned in winter 6 research has shown that pruning wounds heal 20% more quickly in the spring due to decay fungi produce spores therefore fall pruning is discouraged town of edenton unified development 99 appendix f9 c basic pruning methods the type of pruning cut not only affects the initial appearance of the branch or plant but also determines growth the following pruning methods produce quite different growth responses 1 heading back is cutting a one year old shoot back to a bud tip pruning or cutting an older branch back to a stub or a munch smaller later heading back a large branch is often called topping lopping or stubbing see figure 2 page f14 in response to tip pruning new growth develops from one or more buds just below the cut see figure 3 page f15 the result is denser branching the response to topping or stubbing is a flush of shoots growing from latent buds in the trunk these shoots are new and will branch internally these can break out easily as well as increase wind resistance within the crown tip pruning is acceptable in the training of young trees topping or stubbing is prohibited by the edenton tree see later section of correct pruning of mature trees 2 thinning out is the removal of a lateral branch at its point of origin of shortening a branch by cutting to a lateral large enough to assume the terminal role figure 4 page f15 reducing the height of a tree or branch by cutting back to a large lateral is called dropcrotching the lateral back to which a branch is cut should have at least onethird the diameter of the branch removed the growth response to thinning is distributed more evenly throughout the plant than the response to heading the plant becomes more open and retains a more natural form thinning is the more commonly used pruning method d where and how to make a pruning cut the location of the pruning cut in relation to branch attachment determines the size of the wound the rate of wound healing and exposure to decay organisms the closeness of the cut also affects the amount of regrowth from the base of the cut and the strength of attachment when a branch is thinned to a lateral current research indicated pruning cuts should be made close to but beyond the branch bark ridges and the collar at the base of a branch branch bark ridges are areas rings or lines of bulging bark that may be rough and darker in color than the surrounding bark see figure 5 page f16 this zone is a naturally strong physical barrier to decay pruning just outside the branch bark ridges is not the same as a flush cut which is made as close as possible to the base of the branch flush cuts produce unnecessarily large wounds and increase the likelihood of decay town of edenton unified development 99 appendix f10 in removing small branches with hand shears of longhandled lopping shears make a close cut by placing the blade just to the outside of the branch bark ridge of the limb to be removed figure 6 in heading back to a bud a diagonal cut is made about onefourth inch above the bud the cut should be made above a bud that will grow in the desired direction see figures 6 & 7 p f16 p f17 limbs over 1 in diameter must usually be cut with a saw those over 2 should be cut in three steps to avoid splitting and tearing the bark the first cut should be made on the underside of the branch 12 feet from the crotch cut the branch about onefourth of the way until the saw begins to bind the second cut is made from the top within 12 inches out from the first cut the third cut is made just beyond the branch back ridge or color to remove the stub see figure 8 page f17 if the stub is heavy it should be removed with two cuts instead of one the first cut made from the underside removing a large branch with a narrow crotch angle is similar to the above except the third cut should be made upward at a 3040 degree angle to the actual union of the branch and trunk the actual union is often much lower than the apparent junction where they touch see figure 9 page f18 the use of pruning paints the cover the surface of the wound is of doubtful value people think it looks professional but current research indicates that no dressing currently available in the united states will prevent decay of influence the rate of wound healing in fact some indications are that wound dressings can actually increase decay when they crack with age and allow water to accumulate on the cut surface a correctly made smooth pruning cut is the best insurance against decay it is wise to prune branches as soon as it becomes evident of their need for removal smaller wounds heal more rapidly in order to make smooth cuts tools should be kept sharp and when pruning diseased or decayed wood tools should also be disinfected with rubbing alcohol before using them on healthy plants e pruning trees of different ages 1 newly planted and young trees at planting prune only broken or rubbing branches other branches however low on the trunk should not be removed at this time as they will provide nutrition to the plant during the critical first years of establishment do not indiscriminately prune back ends of branches or the main trunk continue to remove only broken branches and dead twigs during the first growing seasons the third year after planting prune only the crown of the plant this process will continue over several years a young tree should be left with more branches than will ultimately be wanted to provide for the greatest total growth town of edenton unified development 99 appendix f11 start by removing or heading back those branches that are clearly unwanted such as those growing inward across the crown or those with narrow angles of attachment to the trunk see figure 10 page f18 trees that form a central leader eg ginkgo pines holly should be pruned to maintain a leader this may be achieved by heading back competing laterals see figure 11 page f19 removing vigorous erect watersprouts see figure 12 page f19 or removing the leader if it has already been outgrown by a vigorous lateral see figure 13 page f19 trees along streets and sidewalks will need to have their major scaffold limbs at least above head height but until trees have reached the desired height of the lowest scaffold some lower lateral branched are allowed to remain select laterals of weak to moderate vigor spaced 412 inches apart to remain as temporary branches to protect and nourish the trunk as the tree develops a sturdy trunk and top gradually remove the temporary branches eventually the main permanent scaffold branches of a tree must be selected depending on the plants size and growth rate this process may take several years when selecting permanent limbs it is important to remember that the position of a limb on a trunk remains essentially the same throughout the life of the tree as the branch increases in diameter the distance to the ground actually decreases see figure 14 page f19 scaffold branches should have wide angles of attachment to the trunk should be vertically spaced 1224 inches apart and should be evenly spaced all around the trunk see figure 15 page f20 trees that do not naturally form a central leader but instead have a vaseshaped habit or multiple trunks eg elms crepe myrtle require care in selection of scaffold branches vertical spacing is critical to avoid weak branch structure 2 mature trees mature street tree plantings need to be evaluated for clearance for vehicular and pedestrian traffic training young trees for suitable height of lowest branch may eliminate the need for pruning  however lower limbs may have bent downward over time necessitating pruning to raise the crown also called crown lifting and headingup when raising the crown thin back to a more upright large lateral or remove the limb entirely cutting back to a small upright lateral often results in the need to further pruning as the branch eventually loses vigor due to loss of photosynthetic foliage area and shade from upper branches maintain a trees symmetry by pruning branches opposite those removed in raising the crown crown lifting may need to be done over several years to avoid removing too much foliage and thereby weakening the tree removing too many lower limbs at once also decreases a trees stability for a town of edenton unified development 99 appendix f12 properly balanced tree at least onehalf of the foliage should be on branches originating in the lower two thirds of the trunk pruning may also be needed over time to correct branches interfering with utility wires both trees and wires are essential for the health and prosperity of the community inexperienced topping results in complaints and unnecessary butchering of trees careful tree trimming can remedy the problem and preserve the shape of trees directional pruning has the most lasting benefits this method involved opening paths for wires by removing smaller branches the branches selected to remain are those growing away from the wires initial selection of plants with a mature size and shape appropriate for the planting site will reduce the need for pruning of mature trees to control growth existing plants and changing site conditions will still make crown reduction a necessary pruning operation crown reduction is the thinning of branches to reduce spread height or to remove limbs jutting out beyond the general outline of the tree size can be most effectively maintained if crown reduction is begun as the plant reaches maximum acceptable size pruning will be more difficult and the larger wounds harder to heal if pruning is delayed topping is often mistakenly done to reduce size topping is cutting main branches back to stubs with little regard for their location size reduction is correctly done by a thinning process called dropcrotching see f 9 this practice retains the natural shape of the tree reduces regrowth of watersprouts and minimizes the chance of decay in the wound see figure 16 page f20 dense headed trees may benefit from crown thinning to open up the crown and allow better light penetration more productive growth and lessen wind resistance start from the top and work down removing small weaker heavily shaded inner branches if a tree was poorly trained cuts up to six inch diameter may be needed to remove branches arising to close together stubs of limbs broken by storms and wind should be pruned back to the next larger branch as a routine practice of storm clean up see figure 17 page f20 such stubs are the major point of entry for decay causing organisms their subsequent decay makes them a hazard to persons and property mature trees may also require routine removal of basal sucker growth and vigorous watersprouts arising from earlier pruning wounds 3 aging trees older trees will require periodic cleaning out to remove dead dying of broken wood watersprouts arising from old pruning cuts should also be removed as close to their base as possible examine old pruning wounds for defects and signs of decay town of edenton unified development 99 appendix f13 crown reduction may be called for where the branch system seems inadequate for the height and weight carried or the tree as a whole is in declining health some kinds of trees such as oak elm and linden will tolerate relatively severe pruning others such as maple sycamore and ash are less tolerant as previously stated dropcrotching is the correct procedure for crown reduction large pruning wounds on older trees rarely heal and can be expected to show signs of decay in the future crown renewal of restorative pruning may be needed on trees that were pruned improperly in earlier years crown renewal is the practice of reshaping a tree that has been topped to restore a more natural form improve health and give it greater structural strength a tree is probably worth saving if the main scaffold branched and trunk are sound or can be cut back to sound wood a dead branch stub that has a collar of live wood should be cut just at the outer edge of the collar see figure 18 page f21 branches that have grown from topped scaffold branches should be thinned until only 13 remain on each scaffold these remaining branches should be thinned back to large low laterals to reduce possible wind damage and to encourage stronger attachment crown renewal is best done during the growing season gradually over a 24 year period restorative work on topped trees must be recognized as a stop gap method and action should be taken to provide eventual replacements for such plants town

probable effects of a proposed major development upon the natural and manmade environment the er generally consists of 1 an inventory of existing natural and manmade conditions at the project site and in the general vicinity of the project 2 an assessment of the probable impact of the project upon the identified natural and manmade conditions 3 a listing of all licenses permits and other approvals required by local state and federal law and 4 a plan for mitigating the identified adverse impacts of the project the er is not intended to be a duplication of state of nc environmental regulations it

to undertake to mitigate significant adverse impacts during construction and operation of the proposed project the mitigation plan should evaluate alternatives for mitigating adverse impacts and should identify those adverse impacts which can not be avoided town of edenton unified development 99 appendix l1 appendix l guidelines for the preparation of a fiscal impact statement l1 rationale for fiscal impact analysis given the increasing strain on municipal budgets throughout the united states elected officials and municipal staff members have become increasingly aware of the direct public costs associated with private land development projects new development brings with it new homes jobs and land uses which in turn mean new residents businesses and visitors will be introduced to a growing community such growth places new burdens on local governments which are often unequipped to efficiently or even adequately provide the public services required by new residents employers and visitors especially in light of the rapid pace at which new development proposals are being processed in towns such as edenton in order to properly plan for new growth in order to protect the health safety and welfare of existing and new residents local government officials must be able to accurately project resident and schoolage children populations attributable to new development they must also plan an appropriate governmental response to such a project for instance they must project the number of additional public employeespolicemen firemen teachers etcand the kinds of municipal facilities that will be needed to serve the changing population furthermore they must decide whether or not the proposed land use fits in with the localitys future land use plan as expressed in edentons land classification map which graphically represents the communitys vision for its future a fiscal impact analysis provides municipal officials with access to the information needed to make these kind of decisions a fiscal impact analysis provides a realistic projection of the direct current public costs and revenues associated with a proposed development project to the local jurisdictions in which the development would be located when properly done a formal fiscal impact study should include simple straightforward procedural steps used to estimate costs and revenues associated with development so that all citizens may understand its assumptions and calculations such an analysis provides a participating locality with several major benefits first and foremost it can help the community to project service requirements of anticipated development it can also aid municipal officials in the process of monitoring the costs associated with significant land use rezoning and annexation decisions fiscal impact analysis can also provide certain projections of how a new development may impact the existing marketplace ie the local housing market andor the local retail economy finally it can also help a community maintain a reasonable longterm balance in its fiscal management by comparing fiscally beneficial decisions with those that are not the following six distinct methods are commonly used in developing a formal fiscal impact analysis 1 per capital multiplier method 2 case study method 3 service standard method 4 comparable city method town of edenton unified development 99 appendix l2 5 proportional valuation method 6 employment anticipation method each method has its particular strengths and weaknesses and is more applicable to certain types of development within a given geopolitical context however while each of these various methods incorporate a different projection model based upon unique fiscal and development assumptions all generally focus upon developing a public costbenefit analysis of a proposed new development thus no matter which method is ultimately used in developing a fiscal impact analysis for the edenton community each study should consider if not directly incorporate into the formal costbenefit analysis each of the items delineated in subsection l2 l2 general fiscal impact study requirements a general market analysis 1 demographic analysis i local and regional population and growth trends including school population trends 2 land use analysis i inventory of existing land uses ii inventory of land uses proposed by the land classification map 3 existing tax base analysis i total local accessed real property value 1 commercial property 2 industrial property 3 residential property ii total number of taxable land parcels 1 commercial properties 2 industrial properties 3 residential properties 4 real estate market analysis i provide a general range of market values for residential or nonresidential products similar to those proposed in the development being analyzed 5 retail market analysis i identify primary secondary and tertiary marketplaces ii identify retail market strengths ii identify retail market weaknesses iv identify degree of leakage of retail spending to peripheral marketplaces v identify existing market linkages vi estimated linkage and market recapture opportunities b municipal costbenefit analysis 1 general assumptions town of edenton unified development 99 appendix l3 i project population and populationinduced demand resulting from the proposed development ii determine population and student increase resulting from the proposed development iii project square footage of commercial space added and growthinduced demand for retail consumption and office space

employees and additional capital investments resulting from the proposed development total and per capita municipal operating costs and capital expenditures a general government b financial and administrative c general control and public buildings d public safety 1 police protection 2 fire protection e community development planning f public works 1 highways 2 sewerage 3 sanitation 4 water supply g health and welfare 1 public welfare 2 hospitals 3 health department 4 office of social services h recreation and culture 1 parks 2 libraries i debt service ii school system operating expense

secondary 2 school district administration b debt service 3 revenue calculation town of edenton unified development 99 appendix l4 i projecting own source revenues a tax revenues  real property taxes  personal property taxes  income taxes  sales taxes  property transfer taxes  occupation and business privilege taxes ii in developing fiscal impact assessments for nonresidential developments particularly retail developments it will be imperative that the analysis include an estimate for the impact of the proposed business on existing businesses in the locality this analysis should project the net effect of the new business on local income in light of the increased competition for local spending jobs office or retail space etc the net impact could affect each of the tax revenue categories listed above and thus impact the final calculation of projected revenues associated with the proposed project for each of these categories a fiscal impact analysis of a nonresidential project should incorporate a coefficient representing net new business and income drawn to the locality as a percentage of total income attributable to the proposed project this coefficient is very difficult to estimate due to the difficulty in quantifying the impact of a new business on the existing marketplace nevertheless this estimate is vital to the development of an accurate fiscal impact assessment of a commercial project in order to provide the best estimate possible the fiscal analyst must assess the local competition as well as the capacity of the local population to support the new facility for instance a freestanding discount retail store developed without significant planned residential growth has to depend mightily on capturing a significant proportion of existing similar business this existing similar business could be captured to a certain extent from currently untapped consumers from a neighboring town or county  however the new development will almost certainly absorb some consumer spending away from existing local merchants iii chargesmiscellaneous revenues a interest earnings b application fees and permit revenue c user and hookup fees d fine revenue e

scope and authority purpose the town of edenton is expected to experience growth in the coming years it is the role of the town council planning board and other boards and commissions to ensure that future development is in keeping with councils vision of the town and in the best long term interest of the residents in 200 the town of edenton asked a group of citizens to study architectural standards and make recommendations to council for possible inclusion of standards in the towns unified development standards such as these are intended to document a communitys design objectives with the use of illustrations and other examples so that developers and consultants can visualize how their projects work towards the goals of the town plan they are intended to assist property owners developers and town review boards with the preliminary planning design and evaluation of proposals and approval of projects by incorporating the standards in the early phases of design time consuming and costly changes can often be avoided in addition they are intended to reduce or eliminate the more common architectural characteristics of sprawl development and work towards a common vision for edentons future the goal of this document is to ensure that over time the standards will improve the character and natural beauty of the community making it an even more attractive and prosperous place scope this manual provides design standards for all new construction and substantial renovations see appendix b of commercial and medical properties outside of edentons historic district a map of affected areas has been illustrated on  of this manual for easy reference  however it is recommended that you check with the latest zoning maps on file at the town planning office to verify what properties are covered authority for all projects involving new construction or substantial renovation see appendix b of a building or buildings  the town reserves the right to retain a licensed architect at the applicants expense to review the application and provide a report regarding whether or not the application complies with these design standards this document is intended to act in conjunction with the town of edentons unified development the event of a conflict or discrepancy between the two documents the most restrictive standard shall apply town of edenton unified development 99 appendix m4 district boundaries map town of edenton unified development 99 appendix m5 site planning & landscaping figure 1 sample site layout the building is brought forward as close to the street as possible with parking and other services tucked around the side and back this helps to define the identity of the street and gives the business maximum public exposure 11 the primary building entry should always be placed at the front of the building facing the front lot line and be clearly identifiable from the street a in this example an entry vestibule is created which faces the front side and rear parking area simultaneously note property boundaries adjacent to controlled access highways will require a 50foot foliated buffer yard  and secondary frontages on major or minor arterials will require formal street tree plantings 12 parking should be placed at the side or rear of the lot and screened from view whenever possible break the parking areas up into groups of no more than 20 spaces per area separated by landscaping areas b 13 place as much of the building width at the front of the lot as possible to maximize front faade exposure to the public c the front faade should be kept parallel to the street 14 to reinforce the streetedge align with neighboring buildings which are also close to the front setback line landscaping can also be used to reinforce this line d 15 whenever possible attempt to link with adjacent parking lots or provide shared parking areas which can serve neighboring buildings simultaneously e this provides a secondary means of access to the site and can ease congestion on the main road 16 provide sidewalks for the full width of the property with a direct link to the primary building entry f 17 loading docks service areas and trash facilities should be located at the rear of the building and not visible from the street fences no chain link walls or landscaping can be used to shield them from view g 18 incorporate any existing older trees into new site plan development whenever possible to reduce waste and salvage good shade trees h 19 minimize the amount of curbcuts by having a single driveway in and out of the property from the main road whenever possible secondary access points from side roads are encouraged on larger projects when warranted curb cuts should only be as wide as necessary to accommodate needed lanes curb radiuses should be kept to a minimum i 110 the parking lot areas should be designed in regular rectangular shapes irregular wedge shaped parking areas created by following angled property lines are discouraged however this does not prohibit angled parking only create as much paved area as absolutely necessary the town encourages the use of pervious pavers 111 landscaped islands and other green space should be consolidated into useful areas and not just narrow strips of grass or plantings j note property boundaries adjacent to controlled access highways will require a 50foot foliated buffer yard  and secondary frontages on major or minor arterials will require formal street tree plantings town of edenton unified development 99 appendix m6 site planning & landscaping figure 2 redefining the edges corner lots are especially important in defining the street special attention should be paid to bringing the building mass all the way out to meet the corner large shopping plazas should also attempt to infill the front of their lots with new commercial space to take advantage of the road frontage 112 corner lots should try to place as much building mass near the intersection as possible to help anchor the lot and take advantage of the high visibility a 113 gas station canopies should be designed as an integral part of the station architecture whenever possible this can allow for a visual or even physical connection which provides shelter between the vehicle and the building b see appendix a for examples 114 alternative gas station layouts include placing the pumps near the rear of the lot while having the convenience store out in front near the street c this helps to highlight the building shield the utilitarian pump canopy and pulls the curbcuts away from the intersection creating easier access 115 when it is not feasible to place the building entry directly on the front faade attempts should be made to ensure that it is still readily visible and faces the main road or internal street d 116 older shopping plazas set back far from the street can benefit from developing the land at the front of their lot this helps to define the street character and allows for more onestop shopping and shared parking opportunities e 117 provide trees and other landscape screening to shield large parking areas from adjacent lots f 118 large parking lots are encouraged to provide landscaped islands and walkways which help to break up the visual expanse of blacktop and encourage safe pedestrian travel areas g 119 some developments may benefit from having a shared access to a common dumpster location which both neighboring properties can use h 120 all public access ways on the site should comply with the americans with disabilities act visit their web page wwwusdojgovcrtadaadahom1htm for more information town of edenton unified development 99 appendix m7 scale & massing figure 3 breaking up the masses helps reduce the scale dividing the building volume up into a variety of shapes helps to reduce the perceived scale of the architecture and allows placement of the more important volumes up near the front of the site 21 place a majority of the building mass close to the road to help define the street edge in this example the twostory mass is placed at the front of the lot and likely contains the most public functions including reception offices showroom retail space etc a 22 less public areas such as warehouses storage and manufacturing spaces can be shielded from view in the rear this often allows for warehouseutilitarian style construction to be hidden behind the smaller scale public spaces that are in front b 23 the building mass near the front of the site should be articulated with design features which give it a more pedestrian scale appearance natural smaller scale materials should be used near the front of the site and pedestrian areas whenever possible c 24 large scale features such as long uninterrupted picture windows are discouraged they should instead be separated into smaller groups to help reduce their scale and give them a more vertical orientation d the scale of these large windows can be further divided with the use of mullions and muntins 25 larger scale design features such as garage doors should be reserved for the rear of the facility whenever possible and out of sight from the street e 26 different massing at the entry to the building helps to further define a reduced scale appearance and improves visibility from many directions 27 in this example the utility area in the rear is only one story f but this could instead be a two or three story area which is still shielded from view behind the front portion of the building 28 large areas of blank wall should be avoided or should be reserved for the side or rear of the facility whenever possible if they cannot be avoided design accents such as pilasters or other faade articulations can help to reduce the overall scale appearanceg 29 special design elements which help to articulate the faade help to further reduce the overall building scale articulations of the facade or breaks in the roofline help to define different masses and reduce the scale see also fenestration 210 the use of covered porches and similar recessed front entry areas is encouraged to help create a more human scale appearance to the building these also help to draw attention to the point of entry and provide shelter from the rain and sun 211 in lieu of a formal porch entry a small canopy or awning over the main entry also helps to provide a pedestrian scale appearance town of edenton unified development 99 appendix m8 scale & massing figure 4 by articulating the faade with different massing elements you can help to give a smaller scale appearance to an otherwise featureless mass 212 large retail structures are encouraged to articulate their primary faades with various design features to help reduce the overall scale of the building with the use of roofline articulation or mass divisions a these can be used to highlight entry points exits specialty areas such as a gardenlandscaping center or auto service customer pickup zones or separate places of business 213 the town encourages multistory construction and discourages single story with large building footprint build up not out 214 the front faade or entry areas may be designed to accommodate faade lettering where appropriate b 215 the use of banding designs continuous horizontal stripes across large areas of faade is not recommended 216 smaller scale materials should be used on these front faade massing elements whenever possible 217 the size scale motif and use of materials for the front faade design should be kept consistent across the faade in order to tie the entire composition together the use of a variety of design styles across the faade is not recommended town of edenton unified development 99 appendix m9 building height & roof design figure 5 different roof configurations a well designed building roof provides screening reduces the building scale diverts the fall of rainwater highlights important areas and creates a graceful cap to the structure among other things 31 the tallest faade of the building should face the street stepping down in back if necessary 32 the roof of the building should be in keeping with the scale of the structure itself 33 flat roof structures should be capped by an articulated parapet design which acts as a structural expression of the building faade and its materials a fake roof fronts and similar applied designs are discouraged 34 subtle variations which help to differentiate the base middle and top of the structure are encouraged b 35 exposed roof structures are encouraged to maintain a pitch between  12 minimum and  maximum slope on all primary roof areas not including dormers entry canopies or similar elements shed roofs should have minimum slope of  mansard roof designs are discouraged 36 buildings with sloped roofs are encouraged to employ the use of dormers and gables of a commercialindustrial style along the front to help maintain a prominent faade when feasible these also help to divert rainwater away from doorways 37 buildings with sloped roofs except sheds shall provide roof overhangs not less than 12 inches horizontal dimension on exposed eaves 38 breaks and fluctuations in the roofline are encouraged to highlight important areas of the building such as the entry and break up longer runs of faaderoof area 39 air handling units condensers satellite dishes and other equipment placed on the roof should not be visible from the street and instead should be screened by building elements so they are shielded from sight c in addition roof mounted equipment shall be visually minimized with painted colors and finish complementary to the overall building design 310 the roof of a structure should be designed so as to divert the fall of rain away from pedestrian areas such as walkways and doors the use of canopies awnings or similar protective designs is also encouraged at entry locations town of edenton unified development 99 appendix m10 proportions figure 6 a consistent proportioning system many of the faade characteristics of this building are determined by the same width to height proportioning ratio 75 this can help to visually balance and tie the building together 41 the proportions of design elements such as windows columns or bay spacing should be consistent on the faade in this example the windows on the second floor have the same width to height ratio as the windows on the first floor a 42 proportioning systems also can be very effective in guiding other design characteristics of the faade here the same width to height ratio of the windows was used to determine the proportions of many other features b 43 the use of vertically proportioned elements elements which are generally taller then they are wide is encouraged to help give the building a taller lighter and more stately appearance strong horizontal influences such as large fascias or banding designs are discouraged or should be adequately balanced with vertical elements c 44 the proportion of structural elements such as posts or columns should be appropriate to the weight they appear to be carrying columns which support larger masses such as upper floors generally have a low width to height ratio for example  columns supporting lighter elements such as a porch roof generally have larger ratio for example  these relative proportions help balance a faade visually town of edenton unified development 99 appendix m11 fenestration figure 8 fenestration is a measure of the 3dimensional depth of a faade created by fluctuations or openings in a wall recesses such as archways or deep windows are two examples of fenestration they help to give a faade a more 3 dimensional appearance by casting shadows and creating a visual contrast 51 variations and breaks in the plane of the faade are encouraged to create an interesting design reinforce rhythms and cast shadows a flat faade designs are discouraged 52 typically the most fenestration is found at the first floor level near pedestrian areas here the use of larger openings and increased depth is encouraged b this creates a more open and inviting area 53 openings in masonry buildings should express a structural lintel or arch to express how it is carrying the weight above d likewise door and window frames can also use a wider trim at the head than is used on the sides to achieve the same visual effect 54 the primary entry to a building is one of the best places to be creative with the use of depth in a faade the added depth and articulation help to draw attention to the entry and highlight it as an important place e 55 the use of faade articulation such as expressing the structural bays of the building with pilasters or other detailing can be useful in animating an otherwise blank area of wall f the town strongly discourages false towerlike entrances that are not reflective of the architecture of the building 56 the use of porches colonnades canopies or awnings is a great way to introduce shadows on a faade and are encouraged g town of edenton unified development 99 appendix m12 materials & colors figure 9 smaller scale materials the use of smaller building materials is recommended to help give the structure a more pedestrian scale 61 smaller scale natural materials are encouraged 62 when using more then one material on a faade it is recommended to have one as the dominant theme with the others acting only to compliment or accentuate the design in this example the main brick faade is accented with the use of a special concrete block at the base with matching concrete lintels a& b this helps to tie the design together and provides a visual base for the building to rest on 63 when making a transition from one material to the next it is recommended that the change occur at a hard vertical edge or bumpout in the faade this helps to create a surface for the first material to terminate into before the second one begins c 64 when using multiple colors on the exterior of the building only one color should be used as the main theme with the other colors used more sparingly to create accents d 65 the main color theme should typically be of a natural muted shade brighter more vibrant colors such as red or yellow should generally be reserved for minor accents and highlights only and should be used sparingly 66 the town strongly encourages different store front detailing for multitenant retail buildings town of edenton unified development 99 appendix m13 materials & colors table 1 recommended materials chart the
