following a wisconsin department of natural resources administrative rules permits or approvals including those authorized under ss 28116 and 28333 wis stats or b targeted performance standards promulgated in rules by the wisconsin department of natural resources under s nr  wis adm findings of fact the common council finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature  2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life and recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants  3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads  4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading  5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities  6 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes  andor 7 undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding sec 673 purpose and intent 1 purpose the general purpose of this ordinance is to establish longterm postconstruction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health safety welfare and the aquatic environment specific purposes are to 2 updated on  a further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions  b prevent and control the adverse effects of storm water  prevent and control soil erosion  prevent and control water pollution  protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  control building sites placement of structures and land uses  preserve ground cover and scenic beauty  and promote sound

under any of the above applicability criteria b erosion and other pollutant control requirements the following requirements shall be met on all sites described in a 1 site dewatering water pumped from the site shall be treated by temporary sedimentation basin grit chambers sand filters upslope chambers hydrocyclones swirl concentrators or other appropriate controls designed and used to remove particles of one hundred 100 microns or greater for the highest dewatering pumping rate if the water is demonstrated to have no particles greater than one hundred 100 microns during dewatering operations then no control is needed before discharge except as determined by the building inspector water may not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion of the site or receiving channels note there are several ways to meet this particle size performance objective depending on the pumping rate as an example if the pumping rate is very low 1 galmin then an inclined or vertical enlargement pipe about 8 in diameter for 1 galmin several feet long would be an adequate control device to restrict the discharge of one hundred 100 micron and larger particles as the pumping rate increases then the device must be enlarged at a moderate 100 galmin pumping rate a vertical section of corrugated steel pipe or concrete pipe section or other small tank about 412 feet across for a 100 galmin pumping rate several feet tall would be adequate with these pipe sections or small tanks inlet baffles would be needed to minimize turbulence with very large pumping rates 10000 galmin sediment basins about 35 feet in diameter for a pumping rate of 10000 galmin at least three 3 feet in depth with a simple but adequately sized pipe outlet would be needed more sophisticated control devices such as swirl concentrators or hydrocyclones could be specially fabricated that would generally be smaller than the simple sedimentation devices described above but they would not 120194  be required 2 waste and material disposal all waste and unused building materials including garbage debris cleaning wastes wastewater toxic materials or hazardous materials shall be properly disposed and not allowed to be carried by runoff into a receiving channel or storm sewer system 3 tracking each site shall have graveled roads access drives and parking areas of sufficient width and length to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways 4 drain inlet protection all storm drain inlets shall be protected with a straw bale filter fabric or equivalent barrier meeting accepted design

runoff from adjacent areas passing site shall be diverted around disturbed areas if practical otherwise the channel shall be protected as described below in b5c3 sheetflow runoff from adjacent areas greater than ten thousand 10000 square feet in area shall also be diverted around disturbed areas unless shown to have resultant runoff velocities of less than 05 feet sec across the disturbed area for the set of one 1 year design storms diverted runoff shall be conveyed in a manner that will not erode the conveyance and receiving channels note soil and conservation service guidelines for allowable velocities in different types of channels should be followed b all activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical sequence to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one time c runoff from the entire area disturbed on the site shall be controlled by the meeting either of the following 1 all disturbed ground left inactive for seven 7 or more days shall be stabilized by

originates in the disturbed area one or more sedimentation basins shall be constructed each sedimentation basin shall have a surface area of at least one 1% percent of the area draining to the basin

sediment greater than fifteen 15 microns in size based on the set of one 1 year design storms having durations from 05 to 24 hours the basin discharge rate shall also be sufficiently low as to not cause erosion along the discharge channel or the receiving water 3 for sites with less than ten 10 acres disturbed at one time filter fences straw bales or equivalent control measures shall be placed along all sideslope and downslope sides of the site if a channel or area of concentrated runoff passes site filter fences shall be placed along the channel edges to reduce sediment reaching the

or drainage channel if remaining for more than seven 7 days they shall be stabilized by mulching vegetative cover tarps or other means erosion from piles which will be in existence for less than seven 7 days shall be controlled by placing straw bales or filter fence barriers around the pile instreet utility repair or construction soil or dirt storage piles located closer than twentyfive 25 feet of a roadway or drainage channel must be covered with tarps or suitable alternative control if exposed for more than seven 7 days and the storm drain inlets must be protected with straw bales or other
