state of kansas has in ksa 12741 etseq and specifically in ksa 12766 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare therefore the city of andover kansas ordains as follows findings of fact 1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of andover kansas are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study pis that is the basis of this ordinance uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this ordinance is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance the base flood is the flood that is estimated to have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto statutory authorization findings of fact and purposes 11 andover floodplain management calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood c computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in 1  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 federal regulations cfr 5922a3  and to meet the requirements of 44 cfr 603d and kar 5444 by applying the provisions of this ordinance to 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities that serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction  and 3 protect individuals from

not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by kansas statutes warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris this ordinance does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage this ordinance must not create a liability on the part of the city of andover any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this
