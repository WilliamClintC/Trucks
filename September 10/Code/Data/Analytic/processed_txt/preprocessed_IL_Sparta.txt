board is relevant and material once the claimant has proved to the satisfaction of the board that damage to his or her structures occurred subsequent to the date permittee first set off an explosion in the area covered by the permit permittee shall have the burden of showing that the damage was not caused by permittee but was attributable to other causes or to structural defects the preceding sentence shall not apply and permittee shall have no burden where permission to inspect was refused all awards for damages shall be expressed in dollars and shall be that sum not to exceed $10000 which the board feels will fairly enable the claimant to repair the damage shown so that the structure will after the repair be in the same condition it was in immediately prior to the occurrence of the damage claimant and permittee shall each be entitled to submit as evidence bids received from reputable contractors to repair the damage any person making a claim to the board shall by so doing authorize and permit permittee and any contractor designated by it to enter on the property for the purpose of inspecting the same and ascertaining the damage if any if the claimant and permittee cannot agree on a date and time for the inspection and examination the board shall set it if a claimant fails or refuses to let either permittee or its contractors inspect or examine the damage the board shall dismiss the claim no claim so dismissed shall be refiled the board shall maintain its office at the city hall or some other place in the city convenient to it the board shall wind up its
