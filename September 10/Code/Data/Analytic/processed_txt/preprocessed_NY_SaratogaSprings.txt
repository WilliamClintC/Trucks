service nor may a franchisee enter into any exclusive arrangement that would effectively preclude other persons from using the ovs to compete in the delivery of cable service with a franchisee or its affiliates however nothing herein prevents a franchisee from entering into an otherwise lawful mutually desired exclusive arrangement with a building owner or manager of a multipledwelling unit or a

shall pay to the city a franchise fee in an amount equal to 5% of gross revenues or such other amount as may be specified in the franchise  provided however that if the franchise specifies an amount that amount shall be subject to increase should federal limits on fee payments be eliminated or changed and other cable operators in the city are subject to a higher fee b bundled services in the event that the franchisee shall during the term of the franchise offer bundled tied or combined cable services which are subject to the franchise fee with noncable services which may not be subject to the franchise fee to individual subscribers the combined revenues from such bundled services shall be allocated consistent with standard rates or prices for each service in the bundle advertised by the franchisee marketing materials or on its published rate card in the event the franchisee does not advertise or publish separate prices for the combined services the percentage that the price for the combined services is discounted from the regular retail rates of the individual services shall be prorated across all the services  provided however that any mandatory tariff rates imposed by the new york public service commission or other governmental entity having such authority shall be deducted from the combined revenue to determine the revenue subject to the franchise fee as an example the franchisee may offer a bundle of video voice and data services for a flat fee of $75 where the retail rate for services purchased on an individual basis would equal $100 assuming that there is no service subject to the mandated tariff rate the franchisee would apply a discount of 25% to each service thus if the retail rate for the cable service in the bundle were $50 the franchisee would recognize cable service revenue in the amount of $3750 and pay a franchise fee on that revenue  9423 charter  9426 c151  9426 minimum franchise conditions in addition to satisfying such additional or

such other conditions as the board shall deem necessary d rural design and siting standards the following guidelines should be considered in the process of designing and siting uses in the rural residential and suburban residential1 districts when locating new uses on the land there are many options in the siting configuration size and arrangement of elements in the landscape these choices define the character of the developed landscape environment these guidelines are examples of the preferred way to design and site uses but they should not be considered the only acceptable solution 1 four basic elements establish the character of a development these basic elements are a landform landform encompasses gradient slope form and orientation of development in relationship to the shape of the land landform is the signature element that is essential for achieving an environment that has its own identity or sense of place  in the rr and sr1 districts locally distinct natural landform features should generally be left in a natural state  natural rural landforms are typically soft and roll due to the rounding effect of wind and water over time geometric landforms may also be present in areas of shallow bedrock or seasonal flooding the character and diversity of the natural landform should be reflected in grading to accommodate development  minimize cuts and fills when grading is necessary slopes should be graded to mimic existing slopes and blend smoothly into the surrounding landform graded slopes should be a maximum of  and gradually blend into surrounding slopes  24112 charter  24112 c835 figure iv 4 landform character figure vi 5 blending grading into existing landform  new development should not erase landforms that are indigenous to the area instead solutions should reflect and reinforce the areas own topographic features  24112 saratoga springs code  24112 c836 figure iv 6 landform preservation b vegetation vegetation encompasses review of varying plant forms and their relationship to development and its mass on the landscape in addition to the benefits plants offer the ecological system soil stabilization clean air wildlife habitat their presence or absence how they are configured or arranged and their species has a significant influence on development character every effort should be made to  preserve existing vegetation patterns and species mix and density  select and place new vegetation in ways that enhance the rural indigenous vegetation characteristics  vegetation in undeveloped rural areas is typically clustered rural vegetation should not be in geometric patterns that are associated with the urban environment  24112 charter  24112 c837 figure iv 7 vegetation types and patterns  in the rural environment vegetation not structures is the primary determinant of how far we can see and where we look  use existing vegetation and topography to screen new buildings if possible  24112 saratoga springs code  24112 c838 figure iv 8 framing views c structures the height placement forms and patterns of building envelopes can establish an urban or rural character to any development the intent of this section is to identify building envelopes forms and patterns that are complementary to and reflective of rural characteristics  building envelopes in rural areas should be designed to maximize the preservation of the sites natural features eg landform vegetation whereas in more urban environments sites are more often modified to accommodate the building  24112 charter  24112 c839 figure iv 9 siting of structures  the placement of building envelopes in relationship to streets and highways critically affects the character of a community varied setbacks provide a different experience than a street where buildings are placed uniformly along a street rural placement is historically deeper and more varied than in urban environments and therefore recommended  24112 saratoga springs code  24112 c840 figure iv 10 rural road with varied setbacks  when building envelopes must be placed in open fields they should be oriented to and reflect the alignment and orientation of the sites natural features figure iv 11 orient structures to align with topographic character of land  site building envelops so that treetops and crest lines of hills as seen from public places and roads will screen future buildings use vegetation as a backdrop to reduce the prominence of the structure wherever possible open up views by selective cutting of small trees and pruning lower branches of large trees rather than by clearing large areas or removing mature trees  24112 charter  24112 c841  group building envelopes in clusters or tuck them behind tree lines or knolls rather than spreading them out across the landscape in a sprawl pattern figure iv 12a neighborhood cluster  24112 saratoga springs code  24112 c842 figure iv 12b hamlet cluster  the dominant visual context from the rural roads should be of natural and agricultural features with structures visually subservient typically development should be interior lot development with 70% of the immediate highway view shed preserved  the following structural guidelines apply only to structures in conservation subdivisions which are also located in architectural review districts the intent in these areas is to have the mass and roof forms of structures contribute to the rural character of the development these guidelines are examples of the preferred way to design and site uses but they should not considered the only acceptable solution a massing of structures or structural elements influences rural character historically rural buildings were often an assemblage of additions these additions over time created a complexity of roof forms that have become icons associated with our rural agrarian environments  24112 charter  24112 c843 b rural roof form options include but are not limited to symmetrically pitched or hip roofs with or without gables and horse barntype roof ends figure iv 13 roof forms d circulation systems circulation systems are comprised of both vehicular and pedestrian systems in general rural vehicular and pedestrian systems are curvilinear in alignment a pattern that evolved out of historic systems following the lines of least resistance eg stream corridors following natural landforms it is only in more urbanized conditions that roads and streets should take on geometric forms reflecting the built environments they move iv 14 curvilinear road alignments are created by following the line of least topographic resistance  whenever possible roads and the resultant lot layout should be planned and designed so the sites cultural and environmental features are preserved and enhanced  vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems should retain and reuse historic farm roads and lanes this guideline  24112 saratoga springs code  24112 c844 allows a development to build upon the sites historic context while minimizing clearing and disruption of the landscape care should be taken to apply this guideline only where its implementation would not destroy the historic lanes hedgerows and stonewalls it was meant to preserve  otherwise vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems should be arranged to reflect the patterns of the site landform vegetation water bodies and vegetation massing figure iv 15a subdivision roads form responds to and enhances natural rural character features such as streams vegetation and landform are incorporated into the design figure iv 15b subdivision roads design using arbitrary geometric forms that require the removal of existing vegetation and dramatic alteration of site character andor topography  minimize clearing of vegetation at the edge of the road clearing only as much as is necessary to create a driveway  24112 charter  24112 c845  24113 cluster development entrance with adequate sight distance use curves in the driveway to increase the screening of buildings  rural road edges are historically unprotected eg no curbs or gutters with only a shoulder for user safety  trail systems connecting destination areas should be comprised of flexible materials eg asphalt stone dust bark and connect areas of concentrated development  trails should be informal in nature and occur in rear yards  sidewalks should only be used to connect facilities within areas of concentrated development a applicability clustering provisions are limited to the ur1 and sr2 zoning b intent 1 the intent of this article is to permit variation in conjunction with a proposed subdivision plat in lot size and housing type in suitable areas in order to encourage flexibility of design to enable land to be developed in such a manner as to promote its most appropriate use to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities and to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open space in accordance with  37 of the general city law this purpose is achieved by permitting a reduction in lot sizes required for the zoning district within which such development occurs while maintaining the imposed density limitations provision of open space this chapter applies to all properties within 2 it is the intent of this article to promote energy conservation harmonious architectural design better use of existing topography and natural features conservation of open spaces recreational development solar access and design and to provide for economies inherent with clustertype development and conservation subdivisions c delegation to the board the power to approve approve with modifications or disapprove cluster zoning in accordance with the intent established in above is granted to the board in accordance with  of the general

singlefamily detached residential developments within the ur1 or sr2 residential zoning district where singlefamily detached units are permitted in no case will other housing types be permitted 2 in determining the allowed density of a conservation subdivision the board shall require the submission of a conventional subdivision plan showing the maximum number of lots that could reasonably be approved in conformance with the zoning and subdivision regulations for the district the project is proposed and taking into account natural resource constraints such as slopes and wetlands the number of lots that can be developed in accordance with such a plan shall be known as and constitute the base density for the subdivision 3 density of residential units shall not exceed the base density as calculated in b1 except that the board may allow up to 20% greater density where it finds that a the project provides exceptional open space or public recreation benefits examples of such benefits include the provision of a new recreational opportunity available to the public in an area where there has not been such an opportunity  the provision of public access to an important  24113 charter  24113 c847 natural or park area  and the permanent protection of an important environmental resource b the project provides a desirable mix of affordable housing examples of such a mix include the provision of at least 20% of the housing mix below the median housing price such houses or lots shall be set aside for purchase by low and moderateincome households as those terms are currently defined by the citys community development office the board may establish such other conditions with respect to the purchase and occupancy of affordable housing as it deems appropriate c the decision

development or conservation subdivision will not be detrimental to the health safety or general welfare of persons residing in the vicinity or injurious to property or improvements in close proximity and that the proposed development is in conformity with the objectives of the citys comprehensive plan and that the gross density will be no greater than if the tract were developed in accordance with the existing zoning requirements 2 when such development is proposed adjacent to any existing residence or residential area a suitable buffer area as the board determines but at least the same distance as the minimum rear or side yard setback in the district in which the project is located shall be left between the closest lot line of any lot in an existing residential development area or a
