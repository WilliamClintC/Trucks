signs and signage in all zoning districts o13  882017   general provisions a purpose  signs obstruct views distract motorists displace alternative uses for land and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation the purpose of this article is to regulate the size color illumination movement materials location height and condition of all signs placed on private property for exterior observation thus ensuring the protection of property values the character of the various neighborhoods the creation of a convenient attractive and harmonious community protection against destruction of or encroachment upon historic areas and the safety and welfare of pedestrians and wheeled traffic while providing convenience to citizens and encouraging economic development this article allows adequate communication while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design location size and purpose of all signs b intent  a sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification protection or directing persons to a use conducted therein shall be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the principal use of land or building therefore the intent of this article is to establish limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the land building or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for their intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests identified in subsection a of this section these provisions are further intended to 1 promote compatibility  these regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant landscape and architecture of surrounding buildings are legible and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain are not distracting to motorists and are constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition 2 distinguish between areas  these regulations are intended to distinguish between portions of the town designed for primarily vehicular access and portions of the town designed for primarily pedestrian access 3 meet purpose and scope of article  these regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual speech that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the town rather they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth above 4 provide balance  these regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs rather they strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs c applicability  signs not expressly permitted as being allowed by right or by specific requirements in another portion of this chapter are forbidden d interpretation and protection of free speech  this article shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the first amendment guarantee of free speech e substitution of noncommercial content  wherever this article permits a sign with commercial content noncommercial content is also permitted subject to the same requirements of size color illumination movement materials location height and construction f validity  if any provision of this article is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid such finding shall not affect the validity of other provisions of this article which can be given effect without the invalid provision g effective date this chapter shall be effective on and after the date of its adoption o13  882017   sign related definitions see for definitions pertaining to
