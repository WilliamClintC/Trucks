exceeding four hours in length for a service outage or interruption of a payperview event that exceeds more than 14 of the scheduled or projected length of the payperview event or four hours whichever

affirmative request need not be in writing but an mcs provider relying on an oral request must keep an accurate record of the date the request was made c for purposes of this section a subscriber

concerning this practice those rules and regulations shall control with respect to an mcs provider classified as a cable operator a the boardfranchising authority recognizes that the concept of menudriven programservice selection has both positive and negative aspects on the one hand menudriven programservice selection allows the greatest flexibility for a subscriber in that it permits the subscriber to essentially create a programservice package tailored to the subscribers budget viewing habits and informational needs on the other hand menudriven programservice selection is susceptible to unauthorized or unknowing purchases and to uninformed program choices if certain procedural and operational safeguards are not maintained b should an mcs provider implement andor offer menudriven

unauthorized purchases or purchases above a certain preset amount c if at the time an mcs provider implements andor offers menudriven programservice selection such mcs provider also adopts an operational policy which protects subscribers from those potential problem areas listed in of this section the board franchising authority shall not exercise its additional regulatory authority on this subject unless there is documentation that the adopted policy of the mcs provider is not being enforced or is ineffective in safeguarding subscribers from the potential abuses listed above d as for service clusters and the packaging of service tiers and to provide both a disincentive for bait and switch tactics and to promote cluster and tier stability an mcs provider may not switch any

solid waste  see ch 252 storm drainage system  see ch 256 zoning  see ch 310  2571 general provisions  exemptions a findings of fact it is hereby determined that 1 land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  2 this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  3 clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  4 improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation  5 impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow  6 substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality  7 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  8 the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety  and  25622 storm drainage system  2571  9 regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards

trees shrubs and plants  29049  adopted 10p15er2m0i0t 7pabryklinlg no 72007 article xv temporary limited parking for resident vehicles displaying lk parking permits  29050 findings the board of trustees of the village of bronxville finds that there is a potential for a temporary shortage of parking for residents of the village of bronxville from the displacement of approximately 180 vehicles from the kensington parking lot which is comprised of three public parking lots located adjacent to the metronorth train station abutting kensington road in the village of bronxville this displacement will occur during a period of construction in the kensington parking lot when such lot will be unavailable for public parking without a parking system in place to accommodate these displaced vehicles this lack of parking is likely to result in traffic hazards congestion and air and noise pollution and could pose a hazard to residents and other pedestrians in the area the board of trustees finds that in order to minimize and reduce such hazards and pollution levels the institution of a temporary residential parking permit system is necessary  29051 applicability this article shall remain in effect until such time as parking in the kensington parking lot area is made fully available as public parking  29052 vehicles displaying lk parking permits exempt from parking time limits a
