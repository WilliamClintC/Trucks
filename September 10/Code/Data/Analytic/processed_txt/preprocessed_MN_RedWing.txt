elimination systemstate disposal system npdessds permit program and the general permit authorization to discharge stormwater associated with construction activity under the npdessds program 57020 findings the city of red wing hereby finds that uncontrolled and inadequately planned use of wetlands woodlands natural habitat areas areas subject to soil erosion and areas containing restrictive soils adversely affects the public health safety and general welfare by impacting water quality and contributing to other environmental problems creating nuisances impairing other beneficial uses of environmental resources and hindering the ability of the city of red wing to provide adequate water flood control and other community services in addition extraordinary public expenditures may be required for the protection of persons and property in such areas and in areas which may be affected by unplanned land usage 57030 purpose the purpose of this division is to promote preserve and enhance the natural resources within the city of red wing  to protect them from adverse effects occasioned by poorly sited development or incompatible activities  to regulate landdisturbing or development activities that would have an adverse and potentially irreversible impact on water quality stormwater runoff ratesvolumes and unique and fragile environmentally sensitive lands waterways and wildlife  to alleviate current flooding problems and prevent future flooding problems  to minimize conflicts and encourage compatibility between landdisturbing and development activities and water quality and environmentally sensitive lands waterways and wildlife  and to require detailed review standards and procedures for landdisturbing or development activities proposed for such areas thereby achieving a balance between urban growth and development and protection of water quality water quantity and natural resources this division also specifically sets forth the minimum requirements for

as a result of the proposed land disturbing or development activity upon construction of a regional stormwater detention facility in the watershed the city may allow but is not obligated to allow some or all of these stormwater management facilities to be removed the city may also require the applicant to make an inkind or monetary contribution for the development and maintenance of regional stormwater management facilities designed to serve multiple landdisturbing and development activities undertaken by one or more persons including the applicant b the applicant shall give consideration to reducing the need for onsite stormwater management facilities by incorporating the use of natural topography and land cover such as wetlands ponds natural swales and depressions as they exist before development to the degree that they can accommodate the additional flow of water without compromising the integrity or quality of the wetland or pond c a combination of successive practices may be used to achieve the applicable minimum control requirements specified in the subsection above the applicant shall provide justification for the method selected 2 volume control and pollutant management postconstruction stormwater management requires significant attention to stormwater pollution mitigation practices including limitations on volume total suspended solids tss and total

rates are more than 83 inches per hour in these restricted areas the city engineer may request additional information andor testing to ensure that infiltration basins will perform properly and that groundwater is adequately protected f roads and other linear projects road reconstruction projects mill and overlay projects sidewalk projects and trail projects that do not create one or more acres of new impervious surfaces are exempt from these stormwater requirements these projects may be subject to other requirements g exceptions a lesser volume control standard on the site of the original construction activity may be applied at the discretion of the city under the following circumstances i the owner andor operator of a construction activity is precluded from infiltrating stormwater due to limitations under d e or f above  and ii the owner andor operator of the construction activity implements volume reduction techniques other than infiltration on the site of the original construction activity that reduce stormwater discharge volume but may not meet the requirements of postconstruction stormwater management h mitigation if the owner andor operator of a construction activity believes that the requirements for tp andor tss cannot be met on the site of the original construction activity the owner andor operator must provide appropriate documentation to the city as support stormwater discharges that do not meet the tp andor tss standards on the site of the original construction activity may be mitigated offsite at the citys discretion the proposed mitigation must meet the following criteria i mitigation project areas should be selected in the following order of preference and in consultation and with approval by the city a locations that yield benefits to
