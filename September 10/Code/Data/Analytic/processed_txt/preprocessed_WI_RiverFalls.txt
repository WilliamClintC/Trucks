titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title

constitutes a regulation of nonexpressive conduct namely circumstances under which the serving and consumption of alcoholic beverages are controlled the common council finds that bars and taverns featuring live totally nude nonobscene erotic dancing and other nude activity have in other communities tended to further the increase of criminal and other offensive activity to disrupt the peace and order of the communities to depreciate the value of real property to harm the economic welfare of the communities and to negatively affect the quality of life of the communities and such secondary effects are detrimental to the public health safety and general welfare of citizens it is the express finding of the common council as based upon the experience in other municipalities nationwide reports of which have been made available to the common council and the factual bases of the holdings and findings federal case law construing 1st amendment rights that permitting the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in conjunction with presentations of nude or seminude dancing and other nude activity creates enhanced adverse secondary effects for the community the common council recognizes that the united states supreme court has held that nude dancing is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the first amendment to the united states constitution and therefore entitled to some limited protection under the first amendment and the common council further recognizes that freedom of speech is among our most precious and highly protected rights and wishes to act consistently with full protection of those rights the common council is aware based on the experiences of other communities that bars and taverns in which live totally nude nonobscene erotic dancing and other nude activity occurs may and do generate secondary effects which the common council believes are detrimental to the public health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city namely the potential increase in prostitution and other sexrelated offenses as well as other crimes and offenses  the potential depreciation of property values in neighborhoods where bars and taverns featuring nude dancing or activity exist  health risks associated with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases  and the potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct the common council in enacting this section has taken into consideration case law construing the right to regulate nude dancing and activity in relationship to first amendment freedom of expression rights including but not limited to lounge management v town of trenton 219 wis2d 13 1998 urmanski v town of bradley 237 wis2d 545 2000 town of lyndon v beyer 243 wis2d 116 table unpublished decision 2001 schultz v city of cumberland 228 f3d 831 7 circ 2000 city of erie v paps am 120 sct 1382 2000 california v larue 93 sct 390 1973 as refined and refashioned in 44 liquormart inc v rhode island 116 sct 1495 1996 and bens bar v village of somerset f3d 2003 and the cases cited therein the express intent of the city is to regulate the potentially harmful secondary effects of nude dancing and activity while engaging in a de minimis intrusion on expression the common council thus desires to minimize prevent and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter urban blight therefore the common council has determined that enactment of this section prohibiting live totally nude nonobscene erotic dancing and other nude activity in bars and taverns licensed to serve alcohol beverages with the express exception set forth in subsection d of this section promotes the goal of minimizing preventing and controlling the negative secondary effects associated with such activity

this chapter is adopted by the city of river falls under the authority granted by wis stats 5 this chapter supersedes all conflicting and contradictory stormwater management regulations previously enacted under wis stats except as specifically provided for in wis stats wis stats apply to this chapter and to any amendments to this chapter 2 the provisions of this ordinance are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the city 3 in instances where the provisions of this chapter conflict with provisions of other city ordinances zoning regulations or the provisions of state agencies including but not limited to the wpdes stormwater discharge permits issued by the department of natural resources under wis stats the more stringent provisions shall apply 4 the city hereby designates the city engineer as the person responsible to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter 5 the requirements of this ordinance do not preempt more stringent stormwater management requirements that maybe imposed by wpdes stormwater discharge permits issued by the department of natural resources under wis stats b findings of fact the city and adjacent townships are growing at a rapid rate the kinnickinnic river and its tributaries are valuable trout waters of regional significance representing a major natural amenity of the community the effect of stormwater from the city and the surrounding towns has the potential to degrade the physical and biological characteristics of the kinnickinnic river and its tributaries the increase in urban and rural runoff as well as the associated thermal and sediment related pollution from present and future land uses will continue to have a detrimental effect on the coldwater fishery of the kinnickinnic river and its major tributaries without proper management of surface and ground water the protection of the water quality of the kinnickinnic is critical to the environmental and economic future of the community development in the kinnickinnic river watershed needs to be carefully planned to protect the existing resources the city has an existing stormwater system much of which discharges directly into the river trout are considered an indicator species of environmental quality therefore trout habitat is a major issue in this urbanizing area a strategy to protect and enhance this resource must be developed locally supported adopted and implemented with an increase in development pressure there is less opportunity for groundwater to infiltrate and recharge groundwater and coldwater feeder streams uncontrolled stormwater runoff will result in increased water temperatures that threaten high quality trout waters in addition uncontrolled rates and volumes of stormwater runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing stream bed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing water temperatures  2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing loadings of nutrients and other urban pollutants  3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads  4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading  5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities  6 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes  7 undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding beginning in 199 the city in cooperation with the towns of river falls kinnickinnic troy and clifton the department of natural resources dnr trout unlimited and the university of wisconsin  river falls prepared a water management plan entitled water management plan for the kinnickinnic river and its tributaries herein after referred to as the water management plan the water management plan was completed in 1995 and may be amended from time to time the water management plan was designed to deliver good quality stormwater runoff to the kinnickinnic river at acceptable rates and volumes to reduce pollutant loading and stream bedstream bank degradation and maintain a river temperature suitable to support a cold water fishery the city was included in the kinnickinnic priority watershed established by st croix and pierce county with the department of natural resources dnr to address watershed management at the basin level the priority watershed plan nonpoint source control plan for the kinnickinnic river priority watershed project was adopted by st croix and pierce counties in march 199 and approved by the dnr on  c purpose the general purpose of this chapter is to accommodate anticipated community development and land use practices by controlling the quality and quantity of stormwater runoff and properly managing and protecting ground water resources and the physical habitat of the kinnickinnic river and its tributaries it sets forth stormwater management and erosion control performance standards that apply to all land development and land disturbing activities specific purposes are to 1 to the maximum extent practical mimic existing hydrology including the existing base flow infiltration storm flow and thermal regime of the kinnickinnic river and its tributaries  2 prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater soil erosion and water pollution  3 protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  4 maintain the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies prevent undue channel erosion and control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property  5 further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions  and 6 control building sites placement of structures and extent of impervious surfaces and promote sound economic growth     applicability and jurisdiction a applicability this chapter applies to land development or land disturbing activity of any size which changes the predevelopment hydrology thermal loading chemical loading sediment loading or increases the rate or volume of runoff leaving the site as compared to the conditions that existed prior to any planned land development or land disturbing activity b jurisdiction this chapter applies to all land development or land disturbing activities within the boundaries of the city no land owner or land operator may undertake a land development or land disturbing activity subject to this ordinance without having met the performance standards set forth in the water management plan and without
