a to provide and encourage measures of protection to those properties identified as environmentally sensitive areas esa b to provide for equitable economic return in consideration of protection and preservation of esa 2 this designation of esa creates a process the city can comply with the comprehensive plans pledge to support orderly growth and development while protecting environmentally sensitive resources within the city 3 all future development occurring in areas identified as environmentally sensitive must be guided by a concern to protect conserve and enhance those resources to accomplish this goal these regulations create a process to aid support and promote development that achieves these environmental goals this process will a identify and prioritize esa b aid developers in the creation of their development plans c aid city staff the planning commission and city council in their assessment of development plans in esa d provide flexibility in the planning process when needed to balance environmental and economic goals b rationale for protecting environmentally sensitive areas esa are areas that contain native vegetation and natural features andor natural resources that contribute to the health welfare and quality of life of the people of st cloud the city has a right and the responsibility to protect and conserve these areas for a variety of reasons including 1 some areas contribute to community health eg wetlands that function to filter and purify water 2 some areas are valued for historic and symbolic reasons eg the few remaining examples of presettlement prairie or granite outcrops that symbolize st clouds heritage 3 some areas contribute to community safety wetlands and riparian corridors contribute to flood control amended  city of st cloud minnesota land development   overlay districts and designated areas 4 some areas are valued as habitat for wildlife andor natural communities some of which include rare native plant or animal species 5 some areas are valued for recreational hiking skiing walking purposes 6 some areas are valued on the grounds of aesthetics and quality of life as open areas and woodlands provide solitude and quiet amidst the noise and crowds of modern life 7 some areas function as educational resources for scientific research and teaching especially by providing our children with convenient and local access to learn about their natural surroundings and their history c use and bulk and setback regulations no development will occur within an esa without approval of an environmentally sensitive areas site plan  the underlying zoning district regulations apply unless modified as part of the site plan review process d identification of environmentally sensitive areas environmentally sensitive areas esa are areas that contain native vegetation and natural features andor natural resources esa contain natural communities ie naturallyoccurring associations of plants and animals whose existence and extent are determined by factors such as soil composition hydrology climate solar conditions and a sites unique history natural communities are named for the dominant plant species within them or for characteristic environmental features  examples include oak forest and wet meadow esa may also contain rare species or protect natural resources of concern esa are sensitive in that further fragmentation disturbance and development will adversely affect and may destroy the natural processes operating within them as well as the composition structure and function of the natural communities they contain esa are identified to 1 protect conserve and enhance the citys natural resources including the citys inventoried and identified native prairies forests woodlands sensitive geological and hydrological features wetlands riparian river and stream corridors wildlife corridors and other sensitive natural features 2 develop a priority system for guiding protection of esa 3 promote open

category 1 native prairies for the purpose of this central minnesota remnant native prairie communities include mesic moist oak savannah xeric dry oak savannah mesic prairie dry prairie wet brush prairie wet meadows wet prairies and rock outcrops the protection of remnant prairie tracts is of vital importance to the city of st cloud in minnesota less than 1% of the original prairie remains undisturbed prairie is one of the rarest ecological community types hundreds of grass and wildflower species comprise a native prairie the least disturbed prairies contain the most diverse plant and animal species small unique remnant native prairies occur in and near the city of st cloud many of these are rare and fragile prairies of all types are so rare that attempts to preserve them are recommended for all sites areas of concern may be small prairie remnants on already partially developed sites all of the above should be managed as prairie and preserved and enhanced if possible 2 forests and woodlands for the purpose of this forest and woodland communities include oak forest lowland hardwood forest floodplain forest aspen woodland aspen forest oak woodland oak savannah and tamarack swamp the protection of forests and woodlands is important to the city of st cloud these vegetative communities often occur on steep slopes unstable soils and poor soils where they stabilize the soil and prevent erosion control runoff and promote the percolation of rainwater in uplands and in lowlands forests and woodlands aid in the control of flooding prevent sedimentation in and cool streams for fish reproduction decrease temperature and provide shade from solar radiation provide wind protection improve air quality and provide habitat and food sources for numerous forest woodland and savannah plant and animal species large unfragmented tracts of forests and woodland are especially important for interior forest species and for wildlife corridors 3 sensitive geological and hydrogeological features included in this category are rock outcrops steep slopes unstable and sensitive soils high groundwater table etc sensitive geological areas  sensitive geological areas consist of materials or structures that are easily modified by human activity where such modification may result in 1 a loss of scientific or historic significance or value or 2 an increase in environmental or geologic hazards examples would include removal of covering material from granite bedrock permitting easier contamination of ground water or use of private sewage systems in areas where thin sediment lies above granite bedrock information provided in appendices is for informational and reference purposes only such information is subject to change city of st cloud minnesota appendix a1 land development a1   esa information sensitive hydrological areas  sensitive hydrological areas include areas where changes in land use which result in changes in the ratio of infiltration to runoff can easily increase the amount or frequency of flooding such flood intensification may occur near or at the site of the landscape alteration or may affect the larger streams in the region including the sauk and mississippi rivers also included are areas where ground water is easily contaminated or where changes in the water table the level of the top of the ground water can cause side effects like surface subsidence and damage to foundations or utilities rock outcrops  rock outcrops in the inventory were rated solely on the plant species invading their surfaces as crucial for development and planning purposes is their hydrogeological significance rock outcrops in central minnesota are visible flags that signal an underlying bedrock system in the 1990s there was a growing awareness that fractures and faults in the crystalline basement rocks have influenced erosion deposition and fluid migration patterns in overlaying sediments and sedimentary rocks there are linkages between bedrock and overburden patterns these links are borne out by patterns in vegetation human economic development and human environmental impact in addition the geology and topography influence current movement of surface and groundwater all these affect biotic communities to help guide development and stewardship any property with outcrops should be carefully evaluated hydrogeologically 4 rare species sites rare species sites include state and federally listed endangered threatened and rare species and species of special concern each species contains its own unique genetic pool which can prove beneficial to us in a number of ways over the past two centuries loss of habitat has become the single most important factor threatening the survival of species because oak savannahs prairies and prairie wetlands have suffered the greatest alteration of all minnesota habitats their indigenous species are under the greatest threat the future of minnesotas endangered species depends upon adequate habitat preservation 5 riparian corridors river and stream corridors riparian corridors are vegetated zones often forested along the edge of a river river segment or stream they include floodplains shorelands and may include floodplain forest lowland hardwood forest tamarack swamp willow swamp cattail marsh mixed emergent marsh oak woodland and wet prairie these zones act as buffers that provide and help sustain resource values for the river or stream these values can be fit into one of four functional categories 1 water quality 2 wildlife 3 aesthetics and recreation 4 flood control how wide a riparian corridor should be will depend on the functional value one is interested in conserving as a general rule the wider the buffer the better however this is often not practical due to social economic and political factors 6 wetlands for the purpose of this included in this category are cattail marsh willow swamp wet meadow wet prairie mixed emergent marsh tamarack swamp floodplain forest and lowland hardwood forest wetlands are essential habitat for many fish and wildlife species they serve as storage areas for excess water during flooding wetlands act as a filter for sediments and nutrients as water travels before reaching lakes rivers and streams wetlands also function as ground water recharge areas they are often used for public recreation and some types have commercial value wetland means land transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow water as defined

8420 as well as working within the confines of this wildlife corridors this category includes riparian corridors flightways migration routes nursery and nesting habitats roosting sites and other wildlife habitat functions of such corridors include 1 places where plants and animals can live and reproduce  2 places where animals can move from one place to another in relative safety to find food water or mates either on a daily or seasonal basis corridors for animals and plants are important for the following reasons 1 to avoid excessive inbreeding small populations of a species in one habitat island need to have some contact with a population of the same species in another habitat island 2 species loss from a habitat island is less likely when that island is connected to a similar habitat island ie maintaining corridors between areas of similar habitat helps sustain species diversity information provided in appendices is for informational and reference purposes only such information is subject to change city of st cloud minnesota appendix a1 land development a1   esa information best management practices native prairies  prescribed burning at appropriate times rotational burning should occur at two to ten year intervals depending upon prairie type and condition a healthier more diverse prairie and the protection of prairie animals results from burning only a portion of a prairie each year fire promotes the growth of grasses and reduces weeds and tree species a year of no burn promotes flowers and provides overwintering for butterfly and insect larvae and pupae burning in spring after cool season exotics have grown and before warm season native prairie species have emerged promotes the native species late summer and fall burning after dormancy of prairie species is more effective in controlling brush burning regimes should vary over time so that tracts are eventually burned at varying times of the year and varying intensities in conjunction with burning or if burning is not suitable the following measures may be options  controlled managed rotational grazing at appropriate times overgrazing can result in the loss of prairie species and diminish the quality of the prairie grazing should begin mid to late june plants should not be grazed below six inches rotational grazing allows for prairie flowers and seed production in nongrazed areas  mowing and removal of plant material at appropriate times once a year mowing for haying once in a year every two to several years should follow the end of nesting time for ground nesting birds about july 15 and allow flower and seed production of prairie species in late summer and fall to discourage cool season exotic species and encourage warm season native species mowing can occur two times a year spring after cool season species have emerged but before warm season native species  and fall after dormancy of native species  removal of exotics spot treatments of herbicide and stump cut treatment with herbicide to remove nuisance species such as siberian elm buckthorn and honeysuckle  removal of trees nonnatives such as siberian elm have been mentioned sometimes native trees such as box elder green ash and aspen need to be removed also this can be done by cutting girdling and cut stump treatment as appropriate to species  physical disturbance of the soil should be avoided including compaction due to use by vehicles heavy foot traffic as well as plowing cultivating and scraping  maintain solar radiation during the growing season  maintain natural hydrology zero change

as those separating housing from busy roads or commercial areas and trees aesthetically important to the community should be considered for preservation  particularly large or historic trees should be considered for preservation  within smaller tracts of wooded areas being developed measures to minimize tree loss and woodland degradation should be considered guidelines might include  placing roads and structures so that the development does not fragment the forest or woodland or sever connections to adjacent wooded or environmentally sensitive areas development along the periphery is preferred  clustering development near the edge of a woodland or in existing clearings is another possibility to maximize the amount of woodland including native understory that is preserved as development takes place innovative site designs which accomplish this same goal should be encouraged  placing roads driveways the footprint of structures and construction activity etc to minimize removal and death of the largest and most valuable trees both size and species of trees need to be considered some native tree species are more uncommon andor more difficult to replace  requiring tree protection measures during construction in general trees need to be protected from compaction taking away or piling of dirt materials etc and physical damage to bark or root systems see appendix e references regarding tree protection during construction  in order to prevent the spread of oak wilt avoiding construction activities involving oak trees during those months when oak wilt is most likely to spread april   retaining natural duff decaying vegetative matter under trees and groups of trees the duff layer cools soil temperature provides mulch nutrients and moisture to keep trees healthy  maintaining natural understory including native shrub and herb layers native vegetation harbors more plant and animal species diversity and might allow for the natural regeneration of trees and related species and the sustainability of the forest  control of exotic species especially buckthorn should be encouraged  tree replacement with the same or similar species should be considered in cases where trees of significant size or number must be removed the above was based on information from the mndnr forestry division and natural heritage and non game research program the city of burnsville mn woodland

tool applicability for local governments resources and references perpetual conservation easement a legally binding agreement between a landowner and a qualifying government agency or nonprofit organization in which the landowner voluntarily agrees to specified terms that permanently limit the use and development of a given property for the purpose of protecting agricultural open space cultural or environmental values the easement may be sold by the landowner or donated in which case there may be significant income tax benefits an easement runs with the lands title and is binding on all future owners  to provide a greater degree of protection for high quality natural features found within existing parks and on other public lands  to establish development buffers on and around the perimeter of environmentally sensitive sites  to promote volunteer landowner conservation measures while keeping land in private ownership and on the tax rolls  to ensure permanent protection of

different names a preservation overlay zone is a geographic area demarcated within a city township or county the boundaries of which are based on concentrations of highly valued natural features as identified planning process involving extensive background studies a combination of conservation tools may be utilized to protect natural features within the zone including but not limited to acquisition of land by a public agency restrictions on utilities and transportation development encouragement of best management practices in use of chemicalspesticides reduce housing densities and other land use controls compliance may be voluntary or mandatory  preservation overlay zones are appropriate for communities that retain quality natural features such as undeveloped watersheds forest or other native plant communities or geographic features such as bluffs that occur over areas of divided ownership  the process of identifying and ranking natural features to determine reasonable boundaries for the zone will require the services of professional ecologists as part of the planning process ecologists should also be consulted as to the determination of appropriate controls to effectively minimize threats to the integrity of natural features within the zone  lake elmo mn has established an open spaceagricultural preservation and development overlay district that includes

sending zone may sell their unused development rights on the open market to land developers and brokers who then use the purchased rights to increase their allowable building density in the receiving zone  to work effectively tdr programs require 1 a high demand for housing or other development in the receiving zone 2 capability of the administering government unit to set up and oversee the

a local government unit or nonprofit organization in order to accomplish protection of natural features open space or agricultural values pdr programs are generally applied as part of a formal program with specific criteria used to select acquisitions a pdr program may be viewed as a systematic use of conservation easements  pdr programs require 1 the capability of the administering government unit to set up and oversee the program on an ongoing basis 2 a funding mechanism to finance the acquisition of development rights a pdr program may or may not be set up to require willing participation of the seller willing participation of the seller is considered preferable in that it makes the program more effective appropriate for largescale efforts where keeping land in private ownership is
