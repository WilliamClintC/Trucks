the city makes the following findings 1 secondhand smoke as defined herein includes both smoke exhaled and smoke from the end of a burning cigarette cigar or pipe  and includes a complex mixture of nearly 5000 chemical compounds including 43 chemicals that are known human carcinogens  and 2 the health consequences of involuntary smoking have been reported by the us surgeon general to be a cause of disease including lung cancer in healthy nonsmokers  and 3 the us surgeon general has concluded that a simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same airspace does not eliminate the exposure of nonsmokers  and 4 secondhand smoke has been classified by the environmental protection agency epa as a known cause of cancer in humans group a carcinogen like asbestos arsenic hexavalent chromium  and 5 the national institutes of health centers for disease control and prevention national toxicology program report on carcinogens and the international agency for research and cancer have all reported that secondhand smoke is a human carcinogen  and 6 numerous medical and scientific studies show substantial levels of exposure to secondhand smoke among the united states population and over the past two decades the health hazards resulting from exposure to secondhand smoke have been increasingly recognized  and 7 secondhand smoke inhaled by a pregnant woman can increase the risk for low weight babies  and 8 exposure to secondhand smoke by children leads to decreased lung function asthma pneumonia ear infections bronchitis and even sudden infant death syndrome  and 9 exposure to secondhand smoke nearly doubles the risk of heart attack  and 10 460000 annual deaths in the united states directly attributed to tobacco use of which 55000 are involuntary tobacco users  and 11 workplaces have been shown to be locations of significant exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke by employees working in the town of sullivans island  and 12 both the public health services national toxicology program and the world health organizations international agency for research on cancer identify secondhand smoke as a human class a carcinogen and state that there is no safe level of exposure  and 13 there are laws ordinances and regulations in place that protect workers from other environmental hazards including class a carcinogens asbestos arsenic and benzene but none which regulate exposure to secondhand smoke  and 14 prohibiting smoking in the workplace increases public awareness of the negative health effects of smoking reduces the social acceptability of smoking and reduces harm to children and other nonsmokers  and 15 the south carolina general assembly at et seq the clean indoor air act of 1990 imposed certain limitations on smoking for example it limited smoking in government buildings the definition of which includes cityowned buildings except where the owner of such building shall designate smoking areas city council has now determined that additional regulation of smoking in areas beyond those addressed in the clean indoor air act of 1990 is appropriate in furtherance of its duty to protect the health of its citizens and employees in the workplace and therefore enacts this article a 1092006 intent city council finds that it is in the best interest of the people of this city to protect nonsmokers from involuntary exposure to

required by state and federal laws to control and reduce stormwater runoff and associated pollutants the management of stormwater runoff and sediment is necessary to reduce pollution siltation sedimentation local flooding and stream channel erosion all of which impact adversely on land and water resources and the health safety property and welfare of the residents of the city b the city maintains a system of stormwater management facilities including but not limited to inlets conduits manholes channels ditches drainage easements infiltration facilities and other components as well as natural waterways c the stormwater management facilities and components of the city need to be regularly maintained rehabilitated upgraded or expanded and additional stormwater management facilities and measures need to be installed throughout the city d there are chronic drainage problems in numerous areas of the city which on an annual basis threaten property limit access to property create unpredictable driving conditions and present a negative image of the citys ability to address community problems e there is no comprehensive mapping system or base line data to assist in analysis design andor development of comprehensive maintenance and retrofit programs and there is no long term comprehensive drainage infrastructure maintenance programplan in the city f there is a lack of resources equipment manpower funds in the city to address problems comprehensively and within a defined time frame g the city is a community comprised of citizens with a wide range of incomes with varying means to afford government services h in the city current and anticipated growth will contribute to the need for improvements in and maintenance of the stormwater management system i the city needs to upgrade its capability to maintain existing and future stormwater management facilities and measures j every parcel of real property in the city either uses or benefits from the stormwater management system and the improvement of existing facilities and construction of additional facilities in the system will directly or indirectly benefit the owners of all real property k the extent of use of the stormwater management system by each classification of real property is dependent on a variety of factors that influence runoff such as land use topography intensity of development amount of impervious surface and location in a particular watershed or basin l property owners and users should finance the stormwater management system to the extent they contribute to the need for the system and to the extent they benefit from the system and charges therefore should bear a reasonable relationship to the cost of the service and every effort should be made to fairly and reasonably spread the cost of the system to all property owners and users m creating a permanent stormwater management utility requires stormwater management utility fees and classifications be established thereunder n in general two methods for determining ratesfees are widely used impervious area method and intensity of development method both rate structures attempt to provide a fair equitable and costeffective method of financing the utility the city has evaluated the two methods for determining rate structures and has decided to use a modified version of the intensity of development method as detailed in this chapter and believes this decision to be in the best interests of the community and environment o after careful review a base rate in the amount of $2400 per year is determined to be fair and reasonable and in the best interests of the community p it is in the best interests of the citizens of this city and most specifically the owners of real property that a stormwater management utility with fees and classifications thereunder be established by ordinance and implemented as part of the citys utility enterprise system as authorized by sc  et seq and specifically  4814120  5730 and other relevant laws and regulations of the state q in accordance with state and federal laws and regulations the requirements applicable to designated sms4s and the city will become more stringent since municipal compliance is an iterative process therefore the creation of a stormwater management utility that provides for a source of funding will ensure that the city attains compliance with the state and federal requirements the failure to attain compliance with applicable state and federal requirements will subject the city to fines penalties and liabilities under the clean water act  title

descriptive value based on the total gross land area and the amount of impervious surface the eru is used to relate a rate charged for a typical residential property and this becomes the common denominator by which all other classifications of properties are evaluated in general there are two principal methods used to assign values for impervious surfaces actual amounts of impervious surface on a parcel can be physically measured or accepted land use coefficients can be used to relate imperviousness to the intensity of development the latter method is adopted herein pursuant to this chapter an eru is considered to be a singlefamily lot less than or equal to 20000 square feet the runoff coefficient assigned to the eru is 036 the runoff coefficients assigned to the classifications

buildings spatial elements like massing proportions scale setbacks spaces between buildings and their relative positions should be used to integrate new buildings into the existing environment buildings that are stylized in an attempt to use the building itself as advertising should be discouraged particularly where the proposed architecture is the result of a corporate or franchise style new construction should provide variety and diversity and express its own uniqueness of structure location or tenant 2 scale and proportion the patterns sizes and shapes of elements materials and openings all influence a buildings scale two important considerations are how these elements relate to human size and how they relate to each other in terms of scale proportion is the relationship of one dimension to another and creates visual order among the elements of a building height can lend a building dignity and grace conversely it can contribute to unacceptable bulk and dominance it is the height in combination with other features that results in a positive or negative outcome the height and scale of each building should take into consideration its site and existing or anticipated neighboring buildings windows doors columns eaves parapets and other building components should be proportional to the overall scale of the building changes of plane should have clearly delineated material transitions 3 faade articulation and detailing buildings serve to spatially define streets proper spatial definition is achieved with buildings or other architectural elements that make up street edges aligned in a disciplined manner with an appropriate ratio of height to width architectural elements like openings sill details bulkhead posts and other architectural features should be used to establish human scale at the street level buildings should avoid long monotonous uninterrupted walls or roof planes on their visible facades building wall offsets including projections recesses and changes in floor level should be used in order to add architectural interest and variety  relieve the visual effect of a single long wall  and subdivide the wall into human size proportions similarly roofline offsets should be provided to lend architectural interest and variety to the massing of a building and to relieve the effect of a single long roof for larger scale developments the building faade should create repetitive bays or the faades should be divided into a balanced yet asymmetrical composition all sides of the building should use materials consistent with those on the front if visible from public streets or neighboring properties and should be carefully designed with similar detailing and be comparable in quality and materials 4 roof form and pitch the character of the roof is a major feature of all buildings when repeated along the street the repetition of similar roof forms also contributes to the sense of visual continuity in each case the roof pitch its materials size and orientation are all important to the overall character of the building new construction should not break from this continuity new structures and their roofs should be similar in character to their neighbors 5 window and door proportions and design the location of window of or door size and location also contributes to a sense of visual continuity along the street in order to maintain this sense of visual continuity a new building should maintain the basic window and door proportions and placement seen traditionally 6 signs a sign typically serves two functions first to attract attention and second to convey information essentially identifying the business or services offered within if it is well designed a building front alone can serve the attentiongetting function allowing the sign to be focused on conveying information in a wellconceived manner all new signs should be developed with the overall context of the building and of the area in mind 7 building materials and color building materials of new structures should contribute to the visual continuity of the city center area they should appear similar to those in existence to establish a sense of visual continuity while color in itself does not affect the actual form of a building it can dramatically affect the perceived scale of a structure and it can help to blend a building with its context building materials should be similar to the materials already being used in the city center area or if dissimilar materials are being proposed other characteristics such as scale and proportion form architectural detailing or color and texture should be used to ensure that enough similarity exists for the building to relate to its surroundings materials should be selected for suitability to the type of building and design for which they are used material or color changes at outside corners of structures which give the impression of thinness and artificiality are prohibited piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in material should be avoided metal buildings should be prohibited commercial building walls should be composed of brick cast concrete stucco stone marble or other materials similar in appearance and durability and in keeping with the traditional architecture of the area decorative concrete block may be used on building walls not visible from a public street or as an accent material only all accessory buildings shall be clad in materials similar in appearance to the principal structure 8 mechanical screening utilities that serve properties may include telephone and electrical lines ventilation systems utility meters mechanical equipment transformers generators air conditioners and similar features or other utility hardware adequate space for these utilities should be planned in a project from the outset and they should be designed such that their visual impacts are minimized service areas for trash recycling containers loading facilities and site maintenance equipment should be carefully planned as an integral part of a site at the same time the visual impacts of service areas should be minimized when laying out a site adequate provisions should be made for service areas 9 alignment the alignment of buildings at the sidewalks edge should be maintained by locating the front building wall at the sidewalk line when feasible where a building must be set back from the sidewalk landscape elements should be used to define the sidewalk edge 10 building adaptation when adapting a residence to a commercial use the residential character of the building should be respected seek uses that are compatible with the traditional character of the building 11 new additions and expansions the design of new additions or expansions should be such that the original character of the building can be clearly seen and should be compatible in scale materials and character with the main building an addition should not damage or obscure architecturally important features any rooftop addition should keep the mass and scale subordinate to the primary building and be in character with the primary structures design 12 renovation of existing structures a changing or rebuilding 50% or more of any faade of a building requires the entire building to comply with the regulations b changing or rebuilding less than 50% of any faade of a building requires only that faade to comply c all new windows entrances storefronts and doorways must be designed in accordance with these regulations d any addition of 50% or more of the first floor area requires the entire building to come into compliance e routine maintenance and repair are exempt from these requirements 13 design guidelines for signs a signs should be coordinated with the composition of the overall faade and in proportion to the building such that it does not dominate the appearance b signs should be located on a building such that they will emphasize design elements of the faade itself and fit within existing architectural features c when feasible a wall sign should be placed such that it aligns with others on the block if decorative moldings exist that could define a sign panel locate a flushmounted sign to fit within the panel formed by the moldings or transom panels d window signs may be painted on the glass or hung inside the window and should cover no more than 20% of the total window area e projecting signs may be considered small projecting signs should be located near the business entrance just above the door or to the side of it while large projecting signs should be mounted higher and centered on the faade or positioned at the corner f sign materials should be compatible with that of the building faade and should use colors that are compatible with those of the building front g internally illuminated signs only flood lights not allowed h flashing signs signs with flashing or reflective disks signs with flashing lights or lights of changing degree of intensity or color or signs with electrically scrolled messages except government signs and signs which give time and temperature information are prohibited if a time and temperature sign alternates between a time message and a temperature message it shall continuously show one message a minimum of three 3 seconds in time before switching to the other message i see for other sign regulations 14 under the following conditions nonconforming signs for single businesses shall be removed or brought into conformity within thirty 30 days after written notice by the zoning administrator a the sign is declared unsafe by the building official b the zoning administrator determines that the sign is deteriorated or damaged to the extent of 50% of the reproduction costs c there is a change that required a new sign permit andor certificate of approval 51310 overlay guidelines specific to the commercial and industrial overlay districts 1 building materials and color building materials of new structures should contribute to the visual continuity of the commercial and industrial overlay area they should appear similar to those in existence to establish a sense of visual continuity while color in itself does not affect the actual form of a building it can dramatically affect the perceived scale of a structure and it can help to blend a building with its context building materials should be similar to the materials already being used in the area or if dissimilar materials are being proposed other characteristics such as scale and
