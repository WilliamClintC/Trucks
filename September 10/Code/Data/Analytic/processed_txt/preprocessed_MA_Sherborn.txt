application to comply with the sherborn bylaw and the sherborn wetlands regulations 12 purpose and protected interests the purpose of these regulations is to establish definitions presumptions performance standards and uniform procedures by which the commission carries out its responsibilities under the sherborn bylaw these regulations intend to utilize the home rule authority of the town to protect resource areas defined in the sherborn bylaw for additional wetland interests standards for burdens of proof presumptions performance standards and procedures stricter than those of the massachusetts wetlands protection act gl ch 131 40 and regulations thereunder 310 cmr 1000 the sherborn bylaw establishes a public review and decisionmaking process by which activities affecting protected resource areas are to be regulated in order to contribute to the protection of the following interests 1 quality and quantity of public and private water supplies 2 quality and quantity of ground water supplies as well as recharge and storage areas 3 prevention of pollution 4 wildlife habitat and wildlife 5 wetland ecosystem health including protecting wetland plant habitat 6 flood control 7 storm damage prevention 8 prevention of erosion and sedimentation groundwater is the predominant source of drinking water in the town of sherborn  therefore protection of interests related to water quality and quantity including but without limitation interests 1 2 and 3 and the ability of jurisdictional areas defined in section 4 of these regulations to function to protect and contribute to those interests is essential sherborn wetland regulation  6 definitions the definitions applicable to the sherborn wetlands regulations are the same as set forth in the act and the state regulations at 310 cmr 1000 et seq except for the following modifications to those definitions and additional definitions some of the state definitions are repeated in this section for ease when reading town regulations people should consult both the state and town definitions where the sherborn wetlands regulations expand on the state definition the sherborn wetlands regulations control

is the applicants responsibility to note those requirements and presumptions contained in these regulations that are per home rule authority of the town articulated in addition to those set forth in 310 cmr 10031 and 310 cmr 10032 the applicant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of credible evidence that the work proposed in the application will not have significant adverse effects upon the interests protected by the sherborn general wetlands bylaw and these regulations and the commission accepts and approves such evidence including but not limited to overcoming the presumptions set forth in failure to provide this evidence to the commission is sufficient cause for the commission to deny the proposed project or at the commissions discretion to continue the hearing to another date to enable the applicant or others to present additional evidence sherborn wetland regulation  11 jurisdictional areas areas subject to protection and review 41 resource areas the following resource areas are subject to protection under sherborn general wetlands bylaws 1 banks 2 wet meadows 3 marshes 4 swamps 5 bogs 6 fresh water wetland beach estuary creek river stream pond or lake 7 land subject to flooding both bordering and isolated 8 land under water bodies and waterways 9 riverfront area in order to protect these resource areas any altering activity within 100 feet horizontally outward from the upland edge of a resource area with the exception of riverfront area shall be reviewed by the commission riverfront area is a protected resource area which does not have a buffer zone that is the area of land between a rivers mean annual highwater line measured horizontally outward from the river and a parallel line located 200 feet away in most cases all work in the riverfront area is subject to an alternatives analysis and must meet various performance standards see 310 cmr 1058 riverfront area for details 42 buffer zones buffer zones are any land within 100 feet horizontally outward from the upland edge of any resource area with the exception of riverfront area 43 activities within resource areas and buffer zones any alteration proposed or undertaken in a resource area or in a buffer zone is subject to regulation under the sherborn bylaw and requires the filing of a request for determination of applicability or a notice of intent sherborn wetland regulation  12 performance standards when the commission allows work to be performed in any area subject to its review it shall require the work to meet certain performance standards performance standards are intended to identify the standard of care to which the applicant must adhere in order to reduce the risk of harm to the interests protected under the sherborn general wetlands bylaw and these regulations the commission at its discretion may conclude based on specifics of the proposed alteration the existing site conditions etc that the project will not result in significant adverse effects to the interests protected under the sherborn general wetlands bylaw and these regulations and that the thresholds for the performance standards set out below have been met performance standards vary according to the resource area affected the commission may employ the performance standards contained in 310 cmr 1000 with the following amplifications 51 general any proposed work subject to these regulations must have no significant adverse effect immediate or cumulative on the interests defined in these regulations or on the ability of resource areas and buffer zones to function to protect those interests 52 no alteration zone inner buffer zone because of its proximity to a resource area any activity within 50 feet horizontally outward from the upland edge of a resource area inner buffer zone has a higher potential to cause adverse effects on the interests identified in particularly protection of water quality and quantity therefore it is presumed that any alteration in the no alteration zone will result in adverse effects to the interests protected by the sherborn general wetlands bylaw and these regulations to overcome this presumption the applicant must specifically demonstrate by a preponderance of credible evidence that the project activities will not significantly 1 result in erosion and sedimentation into adjacent wetlands and water bodies  2 alter shading to adjacent wetlands and water bodies and water temperature regimes  3 reduce input of leaf litter and woody debris to adjacent wetlands and water bodies  4 reduce the capacity of the buffer zone to detain filter and infiltrate runoff  5 reduce the capacity of adjacent wetlands and water bodies to support wildlife provision of essential upland habitat characteristics required by wildlife utilizing the adjacent wetlands or water bodies  or 6 create barriers to movement of wildlife buffer zone or from one wetland to another  7 alter vegetation plant community structure andor

zone 4 alteration of land form 5 change in size and location of structure and appurtenances 6 increase in amount of vegetation removed 7 activity beyond the limit of work  significant changes changes
