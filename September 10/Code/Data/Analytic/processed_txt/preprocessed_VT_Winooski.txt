the public domain between the building facades  the travel lanes between the curbs as well as the sidewalks  urban squares as well as civic greens b the goals for the urban space are 1 to establish an environment that encourages and facilitates pedestrian activity walkable streets are comfortable efficient safe and interesting 2 to ensure the coherence of the streetspace serving to assist residents building owners and managers with understanding the relationship between the streetspace and their own properties 3 to contribute to ultimate sustainability native and nonnative adapted trees and plants contribute to privacy the reduction of noise and air pollution shade maintenance of the natural habitat conservation of water and stormwater management c property frontages and building facades are part of the public realm literally forming the walls of the public streetspace and are therefore subject to more regulation than the other portions of the private property d the private interior portions of the lots toward the common drive or rear lot lines are much less regulated to allow commercial operators to utilize these spaces as efficient working environments unseen by the public and

building the character of the streetspaceboth its scale and its detailsdetermines the pedestrian quality of a given location b streets must balance the needs of all forms of trafficauto transit bicycle and pedestrianto maximize mobility and convenience for all residents and users their character will vary depending on their location some streets will carry a large volume of traffic and provide a more active and intense urban pedestrian experience while others will provide a less active and more intimately scaled streetspace c these are complete streets and must be developed as such
