additional lands beyond the boundaries of the lot upon which said nonconforming use was located as of the date said use became nonconforming the lot boundaries to be used to determine this shall be those existing at the time the use became nonconforming  and 2the expansion will not result in a negative effect on any adjoining property  and 3the expansion will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this will not be harmful to the neighborhood or otherwise be detrimental to the public welfare bexpansion of a nonconforming structure b 1the expansion will not result in a

harmful to the neighborhood or otherwise be detrimental to the public welfare dreductions or additions in the number of offstreet parking spaces provided b and 101d4 and 5 1the particular use is of such nature that the amount of required offstreet parking is not consistent with that which is needed to properly serve said use  and 2the reduction or addition to the number of offstreet parking spaces will not have an undue negative effect or burden on adjacent and nearby properties and the adjoining road network 3the granting of the special exception may be conditioned upon the applicant setting aside a designated area for future parking spaces if the administrator finds that the reduced offstreet parking spaces does not satisfy the needs of the particular use at a later date provided the site conditions allow for such future parking spaces eprovision of satellite or shared parking greater than fivehundred 500 feet from the principal use  1the location of the satellite parking will not have an undue negative effect or burden on adjacent and nearby properties and the adjoining road network 2adequate steps have been taken to ensure that the satellite parking where located will blend in to the greatest degree feasible with adjoining land uses frelief from the provisions of b5 th thoroughfare highway overlay district 1the thoroughfare plan affecting the area in question recommends that a street rightofway be of less than one hundred 100 feet in width for a major thoroughfare and eighty 80 feet for a minor thoroughfare is needed  and 2such reduced rightofway area is determined to be sufficient for said road  and 3the reduction in setback will not result in a jagged or irregular setback line being created g family care homes to be within onehalf 12 mile of each other per  1such reduced separation will not result in the clustering of family care homes that could promote the cloistering and isolation of handicapped persons instead of the integration and interaction of handicapped persons with the community mainstream 2the board of adjustment shall only consider evidence relevant to the above finding in reaching a decision to grant the special exception hextended operating hours for certain nonresidential uses in residential zoning districts per  1the nature of the use is such that limiting the hours of operation for that use in that particular location would result in a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship  and 2the use is in such location that it would not have a significant negative impact on surrounding andor nearby property owners and cannot yield a reasonable return or cannot be put to reasonable use unless relief is granted  and 3in balancing the public interest and the interest of the property owner the grant of relief in the form of extended operating hours is required by considerations of justice and equity administrative appealsinterpretations the board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals from

procedures for the wf waterfront overlay districts are found in 8c2f respectively of this variations to the subdivision improvement requirements found in may be made by the planning board in accordance with purpose the variance process is intended to provide limited relief from the requirements of this those cases where strict application of a particular requirement will create practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships this process is not intended so that variances can be granted so as to merely remove inconveniences or financial burdens that the requirements of this otherwise impose on property owners rather it is intended to provide relief where the requirements of this land unduly difficult or impossible to use because of some unique physical attribute of the property itself or some other factor unique to the property for which the variance is being requested any state or federal requirements may not be varied granting of a variance furthermore use variances ie the allowance for a use to be developed in a zoning district where that use is otherwise not allowed may not be granted by the board of adjustment in addition the board of adjustment shall have no authority to grant a variance for any situations that are subject to a special exception as indicated in for instance if a property owner wanted to place a family care home within a distance of less

such motion  variance approval criteria the board of adjustment may grant a variance only having first held a public hearing on the matter and having found that each of the following findings exist aunnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance it shall not be necessary to demonstrate that in the absence of the variance no reasonable use can be made on the property bthe hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property such as location size or topography hardships resulting from personal circumstance as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public may not be the basis for granting a variance cthe hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner the act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a selfcreated hardship dthe requested variance is consistent

modification required was not the result of a deliberate action to circumvent the terms of this procedures the administrator may approve a minor modification in conjunction with a site plan review as set forth in the issuance of a zoning permit as set forth in the issuance of certificate of compliance as set forth in that notwithstanding the administrator may not approve a request for a minor modification in cases where the development application must go to the city council for approval or to another approval body even in cases where the requested modification is small enough to be granted by the administrator in such cases the administrator shall transmit hisher recommendations with respect to the minor modification and the designated approval body shall have the authority to approve such minor modification in conjunction with their approval process dapproved final subdivision plats 1purpose the administrator is hereby authorized to approve minor modifications to approved

for the future development of bessemer city as adopted by the governing board a number of zoning districts are hereby created districts are divided into the following four categories 1general zoning districts 2overlay districts 3conditional districts beach general zoning district category serves a different function a number of residential commercial office and industrial zoning districts have been created most allow for a variety of land use types and categories  certain districts allow for the mixing of land use types is encouraged all of the geographic area to which this shall be divided into one of the various general zoning districts coverlay districts are created to address issues of particular concern in the community that overlay one or more of the general zoning districts these regulations supplement those that are found in the underlying general zoning district any proposed use located within an overlay district would have to meet the requirements of the underlying general zoning district along with the requirements of the overlay district dconditional districts are designed to reach the same endresult as parallel conditional use districts the major difference between the two is that while a parallel conditional use rezoning requires two steps the rezoning to a parallel conditional use districts and the issuance of a conditional use permit the latter being done quasijudicial process conditional zoning involves the creation of a completely new zoning district designed to serve the needs of a particular development no conditional use permit is involved nor are there any quasijudicial procedures the owner of the property in question or his authorized agent are the only persons who can request a conditional district rezoning res passed 1182010 general zoning districts rural residential districts athree rural residential districts r1 r2 and r3 are hereby established all three are designed for location in areas outside the designated urban standards overlay ie the area covered by the uso urban standards overlay district as designated in although such areas may be served with utilities most of these areas are located beyond existing or anticipated utility service coverage areas minimum lot sizes for residential uses are therefore larger than in other zones bthe rld residential low density district may be located both within and beyond the urban standards overlay district the district which contains the largest standard minimum lot size 87000 square feet is used in two ways to accommodate residential uses in the most rural portions of the county  or to protect areas from largescale residential development where industrial or intense commercial development is called for on the land development plan in the future but where specific development plans do not currently exist res passed 1182010 urban residential districts four urban residential districts are hereby created rs20 rs12 rs8 and rmf the rs20 rs12 and rs8 districts are primarily geared towards singlefamily residential development with standard minimum lot sizes ranging from twentythousand 20000 square feet in the rs20 zone to eightthousand 8000 square feet in the rs8 zone these districts will most likely be found in the urban standards overlay district and are served by public utilities higher densities than those normally allowed and a variety of different residential types may be accommodated in all zones residential developments prds infill residential developments and traditional neighborhood developments tnds andor satisfaction of certain of certain performance design and construction criteria office districts afour office and lowimpact commercial zoning districts are hereby created transitional mixed use tmu officelight commercial olc office o1 and the medical office om districts bthe tmu district encourages office and mixed office and residential uses at an intensity to compliment nearby residential land uses such areas are most often found in developed urban portions of the county within the urban standards overlay district many such areas especially those found along major corridors were originally developed for residential areas but due to their location the blending of office uses and higher density residential development has taken place the tmu district is designed to encourage such mixed development to continue cthe olc district also allows for and is designed to accommodate mixed office retail and residential development  such higher intensity development will most likely occur within the urban standards overlay district where public utilities are present and where access to major thoroughfares andor transit is found development in olc areas will most likely be at a higher intensity level than in the tmu district dthe o1 district accommodates largerscale office developments along with complimentary commercial service establishments ethe om district is designed to accommodate medically oriented uses that lie in close proximity to gaston memorial hospital or other existing or planned community medical facilities in the county in order to serve the general public better complementary uses doctors offices medical supply shops pharmacies etc are encouraged to locate near these medical facilities uses that are nonmedically related are generally excluded for this zoning district so as to not compete for space that could otherwise be developed for medically related uses given the relative small amount of land suitable for such zoning uses which predominate in other zoning districts eg residences nonmedically related retail uses are not allowed in the om district commercial districts afive commercial districts are hereby created central business district cbd urban mixed use umu light commercial c1 highway commercial c2 and general commercial c3 bthe cbd district is designed to accommodate the uses found in a central city location and to encourage high intensity compact urban development in a pedestrianoriented setting retail office personal service and institutional uses normally found in a central business district are allowed in order to encourage more efficient building usage and to take advantage of the areas centralized location secondstory residential uses are permitted as are highdensity residential developments signage requirements shall be specifically tailored for a downtown setting cthe umu district is generally located in the periphery of central business districts and is designed to allow for the redevelopment of older commercial districts in a pedestrianfriendly manner an umu zoned area may not represent the true downtown business core of a community but contains development features eg limited or no front yard setbacks limited amounts of offstreet parking that often predate the implementation of land use regulations redevelopment of such areas for both commercial and residential purposes is encouraged dthe c1 light commercial district is designed to accommodate a large variety of retail uses designed to meet the needs of individual neighborhoods or other relatively small geographic areas stores and shopping complexes are therefore relatively small in size and are designed to be compatible and integrated with adjoining residential neighborhoods this zoning district is not intended to accommodate retail uses which attract persons from outside the neighborhood or which attract large numbers of passing motorists ethe c2 highway commercial district is primarily intended to accommodate those retail service and distributive uses that are typically located along or adjacent to principal or minor arterials and which require high visibility good road access and which cater primarily to passing motorists development in this district is designed to promote aesthetics and the safe and efficient movement of traffic so as to not unduly burden adjacent thoroughfares as larger andor more intensive developments normally will create more significant impacts on adjoining neighborhoods and road and utility infrastructures larger developments may be allowed in this zoning district most c2 zoning districts will be located within the urban standards overlay district fthe c3 district is intended to accommodate the broadest array of commercial uses of all the commercial zoning districts some of which are not allowed in any of the other commercial zoning districts like the c2 district the c3 district is intended to accommodate the communitys larger and most intense commercial developments outside of the central business district and be located within the urban standards overlay district industrial districts afour industrial districts light industrial i1 general industrial i2 exclusive industrial i3 and urban industrial iu are hereby created bthe i1 district is established to provide for areas that contain a mix of light manufacturing uses office park and service uses in an attractive setting with proper screening and buffering i1 districts should include areas that continue the orderly development and concentration of light industrial uses any areas rezoned to the i1 district subsequent to the adoption of this be located so as to have direct access to or lie within close proximity of a principal or minor arterial cthe i2 district is established to provide for areas of heavier manufacturing and industrial uses that are properly sited based on such factors as adjacent land uses access to the transportation network and the availability of public services and facilities it is the intent of this district to provide an environment for industries that is unencumbered by nearby residential or commercial development i2 zoned districts shall be located in areas where conflicts with other uses can be minimized to promote orderly transitions and buffers between uses the i2 district is established in order to provide sites for activities that involve major transportation terminals and manufacturing facilities that have a greater impact on the surrounding area than industries found in the i1 district i2 districts shall generally not be located adjacent to any property that is zoned for residential use except when mitigating factors ie terrain buffering transportation access are in place to substantively mitigate any potential negative impacts upon such residential areas caused by uses in the i2 district any areas that are rezoned to an i2 district subsequent to the adoption of this be located so as to have direct access to or lie in close proximity of a principal or minor arterial dthe i3 district is established to provide areas for the most intensive heavy manufacturing and industrial uses that may have impacts such as excess noise environmental concerns and extended hours of operation uses in this district are extremely limited and include extractive and mining uses petroleum refining and slaughterhouses i3 districts shall not be located adjacent to any property that is zoned for residential use any areas that are rezoned to an i3 district subsequent to the adoption of this be located so as to have direct access to or lie in close proximity of a principal or minor arterial ethe iu urban industrial district is normally found in older portions of the community that were developed prior to the advent of zoning regulations and which contain older industrial and warehousetype uses such uses oftentimes do not conform to the parking bulk or setback requirements that would be applicable if those structures were developed today the purpose of this district is to accommodate such existing uses and to encourage the redevelopment of such uses for industrial commercial andor residential purposes overlay zoning districts overlay districts are established to provide for certain additional requirements andor uses for properties located in one 1 or more general zoning districts thus in addition to the requirements of the underlying general zoning district the provisions of the overlay district would also prevail in the areas so zoned the initial zoning of areas to an overlay district andor any subsequent rezoninqs may be initiated by an individual the

practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the application of the strict letter of the in order to determine that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships the board shall find that the five 5 following conditions exist iif the applicant complies with the provisions of the heshe can secure no reasonable return from nor make reasonable use of hisher property merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit to be made from the property shall not be considered adequate to justify the board in granting a variance moreover the board of adjustment shall consider a variance that is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of the will make possible the reasonable use of hisher property iithe hardship results from the application of the the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship iiithe hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicants property such as its size shape or topography which is different from that of neighboring property ivthe hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly violates the or who purchases the property after the effective date of the then comes to the board of adjustment for relief vthe hardship is peculiar to the applicants property rather than the result of conditions that are widespread if other properties

development tnd atnd guiding principles the following is a summary of the guiding principles of a tnd 1principle of public realm welldesigned places  terminal vistas nonresidential buildings near or at the sidewalk typically smaller and narrower than in conventional subdivisions rear access alleys allowed 2principle of transportation system connected web of streets culdesacs are to be avoided and where permitted are short in length curved as well as straights streets may be provided short blocks sidewalks are located on both sides of the street two or more points of ingress and egress are provided for the tnd 3principle of mixed use tnds always contains a mixture of dwelling types eg singlefamily detached singlefamily attached multifamily dwellings atop of commercial uses etc denser housing is found near a designated tnd center civic uses are encouraged within the tnd similar types of buildings should face each other on opposite sides of the street 4principles of architecture commercial buildings should be of the shopfront variety that cater to the pedestrian other nonresidential uses within the tnd should also be designed so as to cater to the pedestrian 5principles of the tnd center each tnd must have at least one neighborhood center ie tnd center as a focal point of the community the tnd center is ideally located in the geographic centeralthough there may need to be some variation to this theme to insure that the center is viable in certain instances a nearby established and pedestrianoriented center located outside the tnd may serve as an alternative the tnd center shall consist of one or more uses that serve the residents of the tnd and can include retail office and civic uses with limited exceptions ie financial institutions atms commercial uses should not be automobile oriented 6principles of open space compact development should result in preservation of open space tnds always have public open spaces such as greens village squares parks andor playgrounds smaller open space areas should be distributed throughout the tnd preexisting natural features should be retained to the greatest degree feasible and be incorporated into the tnd btnd

of the provisions of this area and height measurements asign area computations the administrator shall employ the following principles when determining the area of sign 1the area of a sign face shall be computed by using up to three 3 of the smallest basic geometric shapes ie square circle triangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing representation emblem or other display together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed such measurement shall not include any supporting framework bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall is clearly incidental to the display itself and does not contain any sign copy for pole signs poles covered with corporate logos or with more than one 1 corporate color will be considered part of the sign area 2for a single wall ie the entire wall that shares the same architectural elevation as shown on the approved sign permit all pieces of information or other graphic representations on the wall that are logically related shall be measured as part of one sign if multiple signs on a single wall share a frame or other material of color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate the signs from the background against which they are placed such area will be measured as part of one sign 3regardless of whether a single wall has wall sections that project recess or otherwise vary from the predominate wall plane the sign area measurement shall include the area of all sign faces that can be viewed from a single vantage point in addition where sign faces of a doublefaced sign are parallel or where the interior angle formed by the faces is sixty 60 degrees or less only one 1 display face shall be measured in computing sign area in all other cases the areas of each face of a multifaced sign shall be added together to compute the sign area sign area of multifaced signs is calculated based on the principle that all sign elements that can be seen at one time or from one vantage point should be considered when measuring the area of such sign examples of how sign area is to be computed are indicated below    bsign height computation the height of a sign shall be computed to be the distance from the base of a sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign normal grade shall be construed to mean the newly established grade after construction exclusive of any filling berming mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign in cases where the normal grade is below the grade at street level the height of a sign shall be computed from the crown of the public or private street closest to the sign examples of how sign height is computed are included below  signs not requiring a permit the following signs shall be exempt from the regulations contained in this shall not be required to have

of such denial notwithstanding the administrator may accept such submittal within said oneyear period if he makes any one of the findings listed in f3 of this map amendment processparallel conditional use districts apurpose 1the parallel conditional use rezoning process allows particular uses to be established but only in accordance with a specific development project some land uses are of such a nature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediate surrounding area andor on the entire community that cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards or the criteria governing planned developments there are also circumstances in which a general district designation allowing such a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could if properly planned be appropriate for the property and be consistent with the objectives of these regulations the adopted land use plan and other plans for the physical development of the city as adopted by the governing board the review process established herein provides for the accommodation of such uses by a reclassification of property into a parallel conditional use district 2the parallel conditional use district cud approval process is established to address those situations when a particular use may be acceptable but the general zoning districts which would allow that use would not be acceptable such zones may be approved or changed only by the city council in accordance with the regulations contained herein 3in order for a property owner to secure privileges for developing property under the parallel conditional use process a twostep process must be followed the property must first be rezoned by the city council to a parallel conditional use district the city council must then approve a conditional use permit which may contain fair and reasonable conditions to assure conformance with this other plans adopted by the governing board and compatibility with surrounding properties any use permitted under this process also must conform to the development regulations for the corresponding general zoning district thus if a property were rezoned to a cudr1  conditional use district and a conditional use permit approved authorizing the development of a particular use that use must 1 be a use allowed in the r1 district 2 meet all dimensional screening and related requirements of the r1 district 3 meet any listed supplemental requirements for that particular use in the r1 zoning district and 4 meet any additional requirements placed by the city council on the conditional use permit 4rezoning of property to any cud parallel conditional use district is a voluntary procedure on the part of the property owner and is intended for firm development proposals a cud district application may not be initiated by a governing board planning board administrative staff or a third party with no ownership interest in the subject property furthermore it is not intended or suited for securing early zoning for a tentative proposal that may be undertaken at some unknown time in the future 5in order for a property owner to secure development privileges in accordance with the regulations contained in this the city council must first rezone said property to a particular cud district and then must issue a conditional use permit
