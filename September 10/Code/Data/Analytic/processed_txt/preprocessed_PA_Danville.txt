of water furnished as determined from meter readings of this borough shall be used as the volume of water consumed in computing sewer rentals or charges subject to adjustment if appropriate as provided in this article 2 whenever an improved property discharging sewage andor industrial wastes into the sewer system shall have a source or sources of water supply in addition to or other than this borough the owner of such improved property shall provide a meter on such additional or other source or sources of water supply the total volume of water consumed as determined from the meter readings of this borough and the meter readings of the meter or meters on such additional source or sources of water supply or the meter readings of the meter or meters on such other source or sources of water supply as appropriate shall be used as the volume of water consumed in computing the sewer rentals or charges subject to adjustment if appropriate as provided in this article 3 the volume of water consumed to be used for computation of sewer rentals or charges as provided in this article may be established by estimates or other methods of measurement approved by this borough where this borough considers metering to be impractical  1949 danville code  19411  4 this borough may require an industrial establishment or the industrial establishment may elect to install pay for and

discharged to the sewer system the sewer rentals shall be computed at the rates set forth under  1948b 5 exclusion from the sewer system of noncontaminated wastewaters and waters used for cooling purposes may be required by this borough or such exclusion may be optional with the owner of an industrial establishment if not required by this borough when such waters are excluded the volume of water or other measure to be used for computation of sewer rentals or charges shall be computed in one of the following methods a by installing a meter or other measuring device on the connection to the sewer system the readings from such meter or measuring device shall be used as the measure of discharge of sewage andor industrial wastes in computing sewer rentals or charges in accordance with the volume rate schedule set forth in  1948b b by installing a meter or other measuring device to measure the volume of water not being discharged into the sewer system the readings from such meter or measuring device shall be deducted from the total water meter readings and the remainder shall be the volume of water to be used in computing sewer rentals and charges in accordance with the volume rate schedule set forth in  1948b c if it is not practical in the opinion of this borough to install a meter or other measuring device to determine continuously the volume of water not discharged into the sewer system this borough shall determine in such manner and by such method as it may prescribe the percentage of metered water which is being discharged into the sewer system the volume of water to be used in computing sewer rentals or charges in accordance with the volume rate schedule set forth in  1948b shall be the percentage so determined of the volume of water measured by the water meter or meters any dispute as to such estimated percentage shall be submitted to this borough after notice of such estimate the decision of this borough with respect to the matter shall be final for the thencurrent calendar year b measuring devices the furnishing and installation of meters or other measuring devices which shall not be owned by the authority or this borough but which shall be

stormwater management   2122 findings the governing body of danville borough finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and floodreduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns  accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation  destroying aquatic habitat  and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge d stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues f federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes  2121 general provisions  2123   2123 purpose the purpose of

the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses from the state of minnesota and the november 199 city of new york adult entertainment study each summarize a number of studies from around the country as follows minneapolis the effects of sexually oriented businesses on the crime rate index is positive there is a close association between adult businesses crime rates and low housing values st paul a significant correlation exists between the location of adult businesses and neighborhood deterioration indianapolis real estate appraisers overwhelmingly 80% felt that an adult bookstore would have a negative effect on residential property values within one block of the site 71% believed there would be a detrimental effect on commercial property values in the oneblock radius major crimes such as criminal homicide rape robbery assault burglary and larceny occurred at a rate 23% higher in areas with adult businesses the sexrelated crime rate including rape indecent exposure and child molestation was 77% higher in such areas phoenix property crimes were 43% higher in areas with adult businesses the sex crime rate was 500% higher in those areas whittier california higher occupancy turnover rates were documented in commercial and residential areas adjacent to adult businesses numerous reports of excessive noise drunkenness and pornographic litter associated with adult businesses were identified  26042 general provisions  26042  the minnesota working group concluded that a comprehensive approach is required to reduce or eliminate the impacts of sexually oriented businesses zoning and licensing regulations are needed to protect residents from the intrusion of combat zone sexual crime and harassment into their neighborhoods1 the new york city study concluded that numerous studies in other locations found that adult entertainment uses have negative secondary impacts such as increased crime rates depreciation of property values deterioration of community character and the quality of urban life2 municipalities typically allow adult uses in heavy commercial and industrial districts the new york city study reported that a study in the town of islip ny formed the basis of zoning regulations that allow adult uses only in industrial i districts by special exception the indianapolis indiana study recommended that adult uses should be allowed only by special exception in commercial districts oriented beyond a neighborhood and not within 500 feet of a residential school church or park property line or historic area3 a study conducted by the manatee county florida planning and development department recommended that adult uses be limited to commercial locations at least 500 feet from a residential district and 2000 feet from churches schools childcare facilities and public recreation areas4 this ordinance adopted in 1992 by jackson mississippi limits topless bars and other adult businesses to areas zoned for light industrial uses and requires distances ranging from 250 feet to 1000 feet from residential uses and commercial facilities regulations in many long island new york communities attempt to protect residential and commercial areas by allowing adult uses only in lowvisibility industrial districts5 recent events and alleged criminal activity at an adult business in a nearby community document that secondary effects of adult businesses can affect rural areas as well as urban areas hip hop club hamlin pa the concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of danville borough which demands reasonable regulation of adult businesses and adult uses in order to protect the health and wellbeing of the citizens certain employees of sexually oriented business regulated by this ordinance as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidents of certain types of sexually oriented behavior at these businesses than employees of other establishments  26042 danville code  26042  sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses including adult bookstores adult novelty shops adult video stores adult motionpicture theaters or adult arcades and especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows offering and providing such space encourages such activities which create unhealthy conditions numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection aids genital herpes hepatitis b non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections  and the incidence of many of these diseases is on the increase sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities classifying adult businesses as special exception uses is a reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult businesses comply with reasonable regulations and conditions and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation there is convincing documented evidence that adult businesses because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them causing increased crime the downgrading of property values and the decline of the overall character of the community a number of municipal studies including the 1986 austin texas study have demonstrated this it is generally recognized that adult businesses due to their nature have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other thereby contributing to neighborhood blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent area a number of municipal studies including the 1986 austin texas study have demonstrated this the borough council desires to minimize and control these adverse secondary effects and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of the citizenry protect the citizens from increased crime preserve the quality of life preserve property values and the character of the surrounding community  26042 general provisions  26042  based on the zoning principal established by the courts that all
