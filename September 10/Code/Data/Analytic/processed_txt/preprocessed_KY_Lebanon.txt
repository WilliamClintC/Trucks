a nature of variances 1 the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 2010 s10 flood damage prevention 24g 2 it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more

the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 3 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the aminimum necessary@ to afford relief considering the flood hazard in the instance of an historical structure a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure 4 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in

threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance f variance notification 1 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community
