available capacity of downstream sewer mains and that replacement of the existing downstream sewer mains is required or that replacement of existing water mains is necessary to facilitate the potable water demands or fire flow requirements for a project the citys urban redevelopment main replacement reimbursement program will provide reimbursements to developers who are required by the city to replace existing water and sewer mains in association with development projects reimbursements under this program may be for replacing water andor sewer mains to provide adequate pipe capacity andor when the city requires the replacement of existing water and sewer infrastructure adjacent to a proposed project based on the condition of the existing pipes the available reimbursement amount as a percentage of estimated construction cost will vary based on the age condition and available capacity of the existing mains that are being replaced in association with the development project the highest levels of reimbursement will be provided for projects replacing mains which are old deteriorated or over capacity in existing conditions with the intent of distributing the costs of such projects between developers the existing customer base and future developments equitably the raleigh director of public utilities shall adopt an urban redevelopment main replacement reimbursement policy pursuant to the requirements and standards set forth in this 82096 to implement this program which shall be approved by the council and incorporated into this reference b the developer shall identify the proposed increase in sewer capacity associated with the proposed development project the raleigh director of public utilities or his designee will determine if there is enough information readily available to ensure that there is adequate downstream capacity for the proposed project if the city determines there is adequate downstream sewer capacity based on readily available information no capacity improvements will be required downstream of the project in the event that not enough information is available the developer shall be required to provide a sewer capacity study prepared and sealed by a north carolina licensed professional engineer evaluating the downstream sewer capacity the raleigh director of public utilities or his designee may require the study to extend to include major interceptors where there is concern that a large project may exceed the capacity of downstream interceptors c raleigh director of public utilities or his designee may determine that existing mains adjacent to a project require replacement as part of the proposed project due to age or deterioration replacement of mains adjacent to a project will only be required when the project will be modifying connections to the existing mains or constructing other improvements such as street or storm drainage improvements in the right of way or easement containing the water and sewer mains the city will provide 100% reimbursement based on the unit prices in 82096f below when replacement of the mains is not needed to accommodate additional sewer capacity or water demands or to address conflicts associated with the project d following the identification by the raleigh director of public utilities or his designee of mains requiring replacement the developer shall provide

it is recommended that all irrigation systems which use water from the public water supply should be operated in the following manner a properties with odd numbered addresses water lawns and landscapes on tuesday thursday and saturday b properties with even numbered addresses water lawns and landscapes on wednesday friday and sunday automatic or nonautomatic irrigation systems should only be operated between the hours of 01 am and  am and hose end sprinklers should be operated only between the hours of  am and  am and also  pm and  pm no automatic or nonautomatic irrigation systems or hose end sprinklers should be operated on monday automatic or nonautomatic irrigation systems and hose end sprinklers should be operated in a manner to prevent water waste so as to avoid watering impervious surfaces such as streets  parking lots driveways and sidewalks at all times 2 check for plumbing leaks a single dripping faucet can waste hundreds even thousands of gallons per year most water leaks are easy to detect and repair with basic plumbing skills and a few simple tools 3 have soil tested by the north carolina department of agronomysoil testing yards in this region are composed of granite soils they need lime more than they need fertilizer 4 plant native trees and shrubs the north carolina state university cooperative extension service has excellent suggestions for home gardeners use mulch around shrubs and garden plants to reduce evaporation mix the turf areas with shaded areas to reduce irrigation demands 5 let the grass grow taller in hot weather by raising your lawn mower cutting height longer grass blades help shade each other reduce evaporation and inhibit weed growth 6 water slowly and thoroughly during cool windless hours to prevent water loss from evaporation 7 be attentive if using a hose and sprinkler consider setting an alarm or the oven timer as a reminder to move the hose and sprinkler as needed 8 use a rain gauge one 1 inch of water per week will keep lawns green throughout the summer 9 water should be applied slowly to achieve deep penetration and prevent water runoff 10 do not water impervious surfaces such as streets  parking lots driveways and sidewalks 11 install a drip irrigation system for watering gardens trees and shrubs drip systems are very efficient because they provide a slow steady trickle of water to plants at their roots network of hidden pipes and hoses 12 use properly treated reuse water for irrigation as an alternative water source raleighs water conservation rules do not regulate the amount of reuse water and therefore any amount can be used during any mandatory water conservation stage contact the raleigh public utilities department for information regarding reuse water availability 13 capture rain water in cisterns and rain barrels the average rainfall in the raleigh area is about fortyeight 48 inches per year runoff from the roof of a typical two thousand five hundred 2500 square foot home is about seventyfive thousand 75000 gallons a year raleigh encourages customers to capture rainwater and use it on the landscape 14 consider the amount of water being used and look for ways to use less whenever possibly do not leave water running  use spring loaded or other automatic shutoff devices on hoses or outdoor faucets 15 use commercial vehicle washing facilities especially those which have been certified by raleigh as water conserving facilities instead of washing vehicles at home 16 use a broom or blower to remove dust dirt leaves and other debris from sidewalks driveways porches and decks rather than water b indoor water uses 1 thaw frozen food in your refrigerator or microwave instead of using running water wash fruits and vegetables with a vegetable brush in a basin or bowl instead of using running water 2 scrape or wipe rather than rinse dishes before loading into the dishwasher wash only full loads consider replacing old dishwasher with a water and energy saving model 3 wash only full loads of laundry or use the appropriate water level or load size selection on the washing machine presoak heavily soiled items use detergent sparingly in order to avoid rinsing more than normal cycle consider purchasing a high efficiency washing machine to save laundry water and energy 4 install lowflow toilets faucet aerators and lowflow showerheads 5 leaky toilet can waste two hundred 200 gallons of water per day to detect leaks in a toilet add a few drops of food coloring to the tank water do not flush wait a few minutes the toilet is leaking if the colored water appears in the bowl 6 commercial and industrial customers not otherwise regulated as a major water user should review their water uses and should consider implementing industry specific best management water conservation practices 7 check for leaks in toilets faucets shower heads and any other plumbing fixtures and repair these leaks immediately      enforcement a penalty violation of any provision of

primary street buildto and side street buildto through lots are considered to have at least 1 primary street buildto the designation of the primary street buildto shall follow the rules of c no buildto is required on the nonprimary street frontage of a b intent 1 the buildto is intended to provide a range for building placement that strengthens the street edge along the rightofway establishing a sense of enclosure by providing spatial definition adjacent to the street 2 the building edge can be supplemented by architectural elements and certain tree plantings aligned in a formal rhythm the harmonious placement of buildings to establish the street edge is a principal means by which the character of an area or district is defined 3 the buildto range is established to accommodate some flexibility in specific site design while maintaining the established street edge c general requirements 1 on corner lots a building facade must be placed within the buildto for the first 30 feet along the street extending from the block corner 2 with the exception of parking areas all structures and uses customarily allowed on the lot are permitted in the buildto area 3 any common area is not required to meet the buildto requirements 4 riparian buffers floodways areas of steep slope defined as slopes in excess of 25% preestablished and recorded tree conservation areas

of the driveway up to a maximum of 25 and city of raleigh utility easements shall not be considered when calculating the buildto percentage or buildto range d administrative alternate findings the planning director may in accordance with reduce the buildto requirement subject to all of the following findings 1 the approved alternate meets the intent of the buildto regulations  2 the approved alternate conforms with the comprehensive plan and adopted city plans  3 the approved alternate does not substantially negatively alter the characterdefining street wall or establish a buildto pattern that is not harmonious with the existing built context  4 the change in percentage of building that occupies the buildto area or increased setback does not negatively impact pedestrian access comfort or safety  and 5 site area that would have otherwise been occupied by buildings is converted to an outdoor amenity area under b height a building height 1 building height is measured from average grade in both number of stories and feet to the top of the highest point of a pitched or flat roof not including a maximum parapet wall encroachment the maximum height encroachment for a parapet wall is 4 feet for a 3story building with 1 additional foot of parapet wall allowed for each additional story thereafter in no case shall a parapet encroachment be taller than 12 feet 2 average grade is determined by calculating the average of the highest and lowest elevation along predevelopment grade or improved grade whichever is more restrictive along each building elevation and averaging all elevations where land disturbance has been approved by the city massgrading process average grade shall be considered the improved grade following the completion of such mass grading however for any building subject to the standards of average grade shall be the more restrictive of predevelopment or improved grade 3 for a detached or attached building type only for any building type located

this section apply to any building in an r4 r6 or r10 district where all of the following are present a the total site area is 5acres or less  b the subject lots primary street frontage is on a street section that was platted for at least 20 years including subsequent rightofway dedications  c if a comparative sample can be defined as outlined in c and at least three of the principal buildings contained in the comparative sample have primary street frontage on a street section that has been platted for at least 20 years including subsequent rightofway dedications 2 when a lot is subject to the residential infill compatibility standards and the lot is located within a neighborhood conservation overlay district that regulates any component herein the neighborhood conservation overlay district regulation shall apply for that specific component c street setback the primary street setback for principal buildings shall be determined by the comparative sample context of the block face as outlined in the following subsections 1 for subject lots of 50 feet in width or less the primary street setback of the proposed building must be located within 10% of the median primary street setback of the comparative sample of nearby principal buildings 2 for subject lots in excess of 50feet in width the primary street setback of the proposed building may be increased or decreased an additional 5% beyond the 10% allowed in c1 above up to a maximum of a 25% increase or decrease from the median setback as noted in the table belowsubject lot width modification to median 50 feet or less within 10% of median more than 50 feet up to 65 feet within 15% of median more than 65 feet up to 80 feet within 20% of median more than 80 feet within 25% of median 3 the subject lots width shall be measured at the primary street property line in accordance with c however the width of culdesac lots shall be measured where the lot width equals the minimum lot width for the district as noted in e2 4 comparative sample principal buildings must be zoned residential4 residential6 or residential10 5 comparative sample setbacks are measured from the outer wall of preexisting principal residential buildings within the comparative sample and do not include the building feature encroachments authorized by d 6 when differences in rightofway widths exist between the subject property and comparative sample properties the comparative primary street setbacks shall be measured and applied from the centerline of the primary street rather than the property line along the primary street 7 the comparative sample of principal buildings shall be identified based on the context below listed in order of applicability and shall have a minimum of three principal buildings in the sample and a maximum of six principal buildings in the comparative sample a all principal detached or attached houses within 300 feet of the subject lot in each direction along the same side of the same street not to exceed a maximum of three principal buildings in each direction b when the 300foot range described in c7a above includes a local street as defined in  the local street may be crossed to establish the comparative sample of principal detached or attached houses as described below the rightofway width of the local street shall be counted in the 300foot range i the comparative sample of principal detached or attached houses continues across the local street and continues along the block face provided the first residential building on the other side of the local street has the same orientation as the subject property ii in instances where the first principal detached or attached house across the local street has a different orientation that lot is skipped and the comparative sample continues to the next improved lots principal detached or attached house c when the 300foot range described in c7a above includes a street that is not a local street the comparative sample of principal buildings is all of the lots developed with detached or attached houses within 300 feet of the subject property on the same block face this method would only capture the principal detached or attached houses that are on the same side of the nonlocal street d when there are four or more consecutive vacant lots immediately adjacent to the subject lot in both directions or at least three entries into the comparative sample are not obtained the scenarios in secs c7a c7c shall be applied utilizing properties on the opposite side of the street that are within 300 feet of the subject site as needed to achieve the requisite comparative sample size up to a maximum of six principal buildings the maximum sample size includes only the six closest principal detached or attached houses in the event that at least three collective entries cannot be identified for the comparative sample the base zoning district rules shall apply 8 these rules do not apply to lots abutting a culdesac unless there are a minimum of three comparative sample lots abutting the culdesac that are developed with either detached or attached houses 9 where an addition is proposed to a detached or attached house the existing principal building on the lot shall be considered an addition to the comparative sample 10 where an official survey demonstrates that a detached or attached house is currently located on the lot or has been within the last 365 days the proposed principal building may be located at the same primary street setback as the existing detached or attached dwelling or as prescribed by the rules above whichever the applicant so chooses 11 riparian buffers floodways areas of steep slope defined as slopes in excess of 25% preestablished tree conservation areas city of raleigh easements

disturbing activities and amendments on file in the city clerks office is adopted by reference as part of this udo objectives a the objectives to be considered in planning developing implementing and maintaining adequate erosion and sedimentation controls and undertaking landdisturbing activities are to 1 identify critical areas identify onsite areas which are subject to erosion and offsite areas which are vulnerable to damage from erosion or sedimentation and provide special attention to these areas 2 limit time of exposure limit time of exposure of all landdisturbing activities so that such activities are planned and conducted to limit uncovered soil surfaces to the shortest feasible time 3 limit exposed areas limit exposure of all landdisturbing activities so that these activities are planned and conducted to minimize the size of the uncovered area at any 1 time 4 control surface water control surface water runoff originating upgrade from uncovered soil surfaces to reduce erosion and sediment during the period of exposure 5 control sedimentation control all landdisturbing activities so that such activities are planned and undertaken to prevent offsite sedimentation damage 6 manage stormwater runoff manage stormwater runoff when the increase in the velocity of stormwater runoff resulting from a landdisturbing activity can cause accelerated erosion at the point of discharge or receiving watercourse plans are to include measures to control the velocity at the point of discharge so as to minimize accelerated erosion of the site and sedimentation of the receiving watercourse 7 control operations in lakes or natural watercourses control landdisturbing activities in connection with construction in on over or under a lake or natural watercourse so that such
