thoroughfare b the parcel has frontage on a major or secondary thoroughfare and is of a narrow width as measured along the thoroughfare which makes platting difficult c the parcel is shaped in such a way that it contains acute angles which would make a normal subdivision difficult to achieve and has frontage on a major or secondary thoroughfare d a substantial part of the parcels perimeter is bordered by a major thoroughfare which would result in a substantial proportion of the lots of the development abutting the major thoroughfare e the parcel contains a floodplain or poor soil conditions which result in a substantial portion of the total area of the parcel being unbuildable soil test borings floodplain maps or other documented evidence must be submitted to the planning commission in order to substantiate the parcels qualification for cluster development under this subsection f the parcel contains natural assets which could be preserved use of cluster development such assets may include natural stands of large trees land which serves as a natural habitat for wildlife unusual topographic features or other natural assets which in the opinion of the planning commission should be preserved requests for qualification under these conditions must be supported by documented evidence which indicates that the natural assets would qualify the parcel under this option the planning commission may at its discretion convene a public hearing held in accordance with of public act 207 of 192 as amended mcl a as part of its review study and approval of an area for the cluster housing option 3 in areas meeting the above criteria the minimum yard setbacks heights and minimum lot sizes per unit as required by the section 130 may be waived and the attaching of

uses of structures and premises 1 intent it is the intent of this ordinance to permit existing legal nonconforming lots structures or uses to continue until they are removed but not to encourage their survival it is recognized that there exists within the districts established by this ordinance and subsequent amendments lots structures and use of land and structures which were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended which would be prohibited regulated or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future amendments such uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved it is further the intent of this ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon expanded or extended nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district a nonconforming use of a structure a nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this ordinance by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved to avoid undue hardship nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in a permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner  except that where demolition or removal of an existing

buildings may be erected on any single lot of record which is under separate and distinct ownership from adjacent lots at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance this provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width or both that are generally applicable in the district  provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width or both of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located yard requirement variances may be obtained of the board of appeals 3 nonconforming uses of land where at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this ordinance as enacted or amended such use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions a no such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance b no such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of

subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this ordinance for this district in which such land is located 4 nonconforming structures where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance by reason of restrictions on area lot coverage height yards or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions a no such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity for example existing residences on lots of a width less than required herein may add a rear porch provided that other requirements relative to yard space and land coverage are met b should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost exclusive of the foundation at the time

combination exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this ordinance the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions a no existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged extended constructed reconstructed moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located b any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use and which existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this ordinance but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building c if no structural alterations are made any nonconforming use of a structure or structure and land in combination may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or more restricted classification provided that the board of appeals either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use in permitting such change the board of appeals may require conditions and safeguards in accord with the purpose and intent of this ordinance where a nonconforming use of a structure land or structure and land in combination is hereafter changed to a more conforming use it shall not thereafter be changed to a less conforming use d any structure or structure and land in combination in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed e when a nonconforming use of structure or structure and premises in combination is discontinued or ceases to exist for six consecutive months or 18 months during any three year period the structure or structure and premises in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located structures occupied by seasonal uses one season out of each year shall be excepted from this provision f where nonconforming use status applies to a

interest in private property for the removal of nonconforming uses the cost and expense or a portion thereof of acquiring the private property may be paid from general funds or assessed to a special district in accordance with the applicable statutory provisions relating to the creation and operation of special assessment districts for public improvements in cities the elimination of the nonconforming uses and structures in a zoning district is declared to be for a public purpose and for a public use the city council may institute and prosecute proceedings for condemnation of nonconforming uses and structures under the power of eminent domain in accordance with act 149 of the public acts of 191 as amended being sections 21321 to 21341 of the michigan compiled laws mcl 21321 et seq or other applicable statute cross reference buildings and building regulations ch 10 state law reference nonconformities mcl a adaptive reuse projects 1 intent typically various land use activities are provided for in one or more zoning districts the criteria for such allocations is based upon similarities in the nature of uses and their relationship to other such uses and adjoining development zoning districts are also established to coordinate with and provide for the effectuation of the citys long range development plan the city does however possess various existing

swimming pool shall be located only in the rear yard article xv  sign regulations footnotes  9  editors note an jan 14 201 has been treated by the editor as superseding former art xv  15001509 which pertained to similar subject matter and derived from            statement of purpose the city finds that signs and other visual outdoor advertising tends to promote commerce and are related to the health safety andor general welfare of the residents of the city and that the preservation of the existing character of the community requires regulation of signs and of other visual outdoor advertising the city finds that failure to regulate the size location and construction of signs and other outdoor advertising may have an adverse effect upon the promotion of business and commerce in the city may lead to poor identification of businesses may have an adverse effect upon the existing aesthetic character of the city and may cause deterioration of business and residential areas of the community therefore the purpose of this section and the subsections thereunder is to permit such signs and visual outdoor advertising as will not by reason of their size location or manner of display endanger public health andor safety  confuse or mislead traffic  or obstruct vision necessary for traffic and pedestrian safety  and further to regulate signs and other visual outdoor advertising in such a way as to prevent the placement of signs and such other visual outdoor advertising in a manner that will conceal or obscure other signs and other visual outdoor advertising on adjacent businesses  to keep the number of signs and sign messages at a minimum level reasonably necessary to identify a business and its products  to keep signs within a reasonable scale with respect to the buildings to which they relate  and further to prevent off premise signs from conflicting with business residential and public land uses and to prohibit signs and other visual outdoor advertising which will have an adverse effect upon the existing aesthetic character of not only the zoning district in which they are located but also upon the overall existing aesthetic character of the city further the city recognizes that electronic changeable message signs are an increasingly important feature for many businesses electronic signs provide an effective mechanism for informing the public of goods and services as well as promoting sales or special events the use of electronic signs will reduce the need for temporary signs which detract from the visual appearance of the community
