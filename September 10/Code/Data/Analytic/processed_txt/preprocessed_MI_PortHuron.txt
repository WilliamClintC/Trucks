neighborhoods by precluding all or certain types of rental properties and thereby preclude the deleterious effects rental properties can have on a neighborhood with regard to property deterioration

the types of rental properties if any that are permitted in onefamily dwellings within their neighborhood b it is also the purpose of the districts to achieve the following objectives 1 to protect the privacy of residents and to minimize noise congestion and nuisance impacts by regulating the types of rental properties  2 to maintain an attractive community appearance and to provide a desirable
