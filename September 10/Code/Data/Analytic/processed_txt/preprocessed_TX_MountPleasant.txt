city to both retail and wholesale water customers this plan is adopted pursuant to 30 tex admin  the purpose of this plan is to encourage a permanent reduction in the quantity of water required implementation of efficient water supply and water use practices the emphasis and the basic goal of this plan is to achieve lasting longterm improvements in water use efficiency bthe city has water rights in three area lakes 10000 acfeet  in lake bob sandlin 3590 acfeet  in lake cypress springs and 3000 acfeet  in lake tankersley cthe city is located in northeast texas rainfall averages are approximately 45 inches per year the rolling hills of the area are vegetated with some native and some improved grassland the oil and timber industries are active in this area as well as some farming and cattle operations the sandy and clay soils are also suitable for truck crops and gardening passed 41701  am passed 4709  am passed 31714  5221 utility profile the city provides water to its populace and sells treated water to both the triwater special utility district and the city of winfield the city will be investigating the possibility of supplying other regional cities andor water supply corporations in the future attachments i and ii to this chapter which are on file in the office of the city secretary contain additional information regarding population customer base water supply system wastewater system and water use data passed 41701  am passed 41905  am passed 4709  am passed 31714  5222 water conservation goals athe objective of this water conservation plan is to accomplish a permanent reduction in the quantity of water required implementation of efficient water supply and water use practices specifically the water conservation goals for the city are 1specific quantified five and tenyear targets afiveyear target reduce water consumption as measured in gallons per capita per day gpcd by 10% to 9297 gpcd  btenyear target reduce water consumption as measured in gallons per capita per day by 3% to 9109 gpcd 2to reduce unaccounted for water  and 3to implement an increase in the reuse or recycling of water bthrough the structured and systematic application of the contents of this water conservation plan the city expects to see a reduction in per capita water use during the next 30 years in addition over the next ten years the citys goal is to reduce the quantity of unaccounted for water and to implement an official water reuse and recycling program specifically the water loss goals for the city are 1specific quantified five and tenyear water loss targets afiveyear target reduce water loss as measured in gallons per capita per day gpcd by one gallon gpcd  btenyear target reduce water loss as measured in gallons per capita per day gpcd by three gallons gpcd 2identify unmetered sources and meter them afire hydrant flushing  bpublic buildings  crecreation facilities cthe city maintains meters to measure both raw water and treated water these meters are calibrated annually to within 5% accuracy to insure proper measurement of the quantity of water diverted from the various sources dthis water conservation plan addresses nine aspects associated with the implementation of the water conservation plan they are as follows 1 universal metering and meter repairreplacement  2 leak detection and water audits  3 public information and education program  4 water conservation oriented rate structures  5 water conserving plumbing fixtures  6 water conservation retrofit programs  7 water conserving landscapes  8 wastewater reuserecycling  and 9 reservoir systems operations plan these are summarized below 1universal metering and meter repairreplacement the city meters all water produced and tests these master meters annually all water service connections to the citys water supply system will be metered meters will continue to be monitored for accuracy annually and replaced on a 15year cycle 2leak detection and water audits athe city maintains a program of leak detection leak repair and water loss accounting in the water transmission lines and distribution system to control unaccounted for losses of water data is recorded daily and reviewed on a monthly basis water audits are conducted annually real water losses are identified and corrected real water losses are minimized by replacement of deteriorating water mains and appurtenances and are inspected by city staff on an ongoing basis bthe leak detection program described in the plan is currently in use by the city which reduces real water losses 1intermittent nightflow measurements are conducted annually  2pressure is controlled to just above the standardofservice level by use of scada system  3the city has one pressure zone  4surges in pressure are limited by control valves  5nighttime pressure is reduced by control valves when feasible 3public information and education program athe city makes available consumer information encouraging water conservation from the texas water development board and american water works association awwa there are several different publications currently available bthe city may mail out material developed by the staff materials obtained from the texas water development board texas commission on environmental quality or other sources semiannually once in the spring and once in the summer to all customers cthe city is committed to creating and implementing a formal and ongoing education program which may address some or all of the following 1provide qualified individuals to speak at institutions organizations and groups throughout the area at regular intervals  2conduct or sponsor exhibits on conservation water saving devices and other methods to promote water conservation and efficiency  3provide and distribute brochures and other materials to area citizens  4work in cooperation with schools to establish an education program and provide conservation videos brochures and teaching aids  and 5develop welcome packages for new citizens to educate and provide the benefits of conservation and availability of native water efficient plants trees shrubs and grasses 4water conservation oriented rate structures the city reviews its rate structure on a regular basis the city is committed in future reviews to be conservation minded as rate structures are deliberated the citys utility rate structure is cost based to discourage excessive use of water the city will continue to review rates annually to ensure water revenues exceed expenses and replacement costs and to discourage excessive and wasteful use 5water conserving plumbing fixtures the city has adopted the 2003 international plumbing all new construction or renovations in the city use water conserving fixtures including but not limited to the following ashower heads no more than 2 gallons per minute at 60pounds per square inch of pressure  blavatorysink faucets and aerators no more than

square inch  hswimming swimming pools will have recirculation filtration equipment 6water conservation retrofit program in mount pleasant the retrofit of existing plumbing fixtures shall be accomplished voluntary efforts of individual consumers for their homes and businesses adoption of a water conservation plumbing provide a gradual upgrading of plumbing fixtures in existing structures many water conserving plumbing devices are available at local hardware stores and can be installed by the consumer additional information on retrofitting will be provided education 7water conserving landscapes the city encourages water conservation landscaping and is committed to informing and educating the public regarding this method of water conservation 8wastewater reuserecycling the city

wastewater treatment plant for plant wash down and chemical feed water the city will continue to investigate and evaluate alternatives for reuse andor recycling water as part of its conservation plan 9reservoir systems operations plan the city currently purchases raw water from two wholesale providers the city has annual water rights up to 10000 acrefeet from lake bob sandlin which is operated by the titus county fresh water supply district and 3590 acrefeet from lake cypress springs which is operated by the franklin county water utility district this wholesale purchase of raw water requires the city to coordinate its withdraw of water from these sources to conform with the water conservation plans developed for both lake bob sandlin and lake cypress springs additionally the city owns and
