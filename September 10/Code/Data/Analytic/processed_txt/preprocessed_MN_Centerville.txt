of the decisions of public bodies or detect improper influences  2 to ensure the publics right to be informed  and 3 to give the public an opportunity to present its views b the law prohibits the use of telephone conversations email or letters in a decision making process among a quorum of members designed to avoid an open meeting c any person who intentionally violates the open meeting law is subject to personal liability in the form of a civil penalty the public body may not pay the penalty h minutes the committee must keep a full and accurate record of its actions at every committee meeting the administrator records the committee proceedings in a minute book in the absence of the city staff member to take the minutes the committee should delegate the duty of taking minutes for

information should be included in the minutes a the time and place of the meeting  b the members present  c a summary of all decisions made by the committee including a copy of each motion exactly as stated whether or not the motion had a second and if the motion was seconded whether or not the committee adopted it and the names of the people who made and seconded the motion  and d the names of the committee member who voted either for or against each motion i order of business each meeting of the committee shall convene at the time and place appointed 1 committee business shall be conducted

provision is complied with c this section does not apply to those materials that are classified as other than public under the minnesota data practices act or materials from closed meetings j motions 1 generally the committee transacts business made by committee members these motions are seconded and subsequently passed or rejected by committee vote a the committee member states his or her motion usually in the following form i move    text of the motion the committee member making a motion does not need to favor it or vote for it the committee member may wish to put the issue before the committee so a decision can be made b another committee member then seconds the motion by saying i second the motion c the chair recognizes the motion and opens the pending motion to discussion the presiding officer calls for the vote at the end of the discussions and announces the result of the vote 2 motion to reconsider this motion enables a committee to set aside a vote it previously took and to reconsider the matter as though it had not voted on the issue only a person who originally voted on the prevailing side may move to reconsider make the motion by saying i move to reconsider    stating the motion to be reconsidered the committee may debate the motion ifthe committee passes the motion to reconsider it must then reconsider the original motion and take another vote ifthe committee defeats a motion to reconsider no further action 1s necessary 3 motion to postpone indefinitely there is an important difference between the motion to postpone indefinitely and the motion to postpone temporarily the motion to postpone temporarily is more commonly called a motion to lay on the table or to table the motion to postpone postpones consideration of the motion until some undetermined future time the committee may consider a tabled motion whenever a majority of the members decide to do so a motion to postpone indefinitely however is the equivalent to a negative vote on the main motion thus the issue can be raised again only by a motion made by someone on the prevailing side of the vote since unless someone changes his or her mind the motion to postpone will once again prevail 4 motion to limit debate a committee may limit debate by placing a time limit on debate such as a limit of three minutes to consider a particular motion  or limiting the number of people who may speak for and against a certain motion such as a limit of three speakers in favor and three speakers opposed 5 motion to amend committee members may offer amendments to a main motion at any time in addition it is possible to amend an amendment currently under consideration beyond this committee members can offer no further amendments when a member has made a motion to amend the vote on the amendment must precede the vote on the original motion after the committee has accepted or rejected the amendment another vote on the original motion is necessary 6 motion to substitute this is a motion to replace one motion with another on the same subject a committee member may move to substitute a main motion or an amendment to a main motion one form for making a substitute motion is to say i wish to introduce the following substitute motion    present the substitute motion when a substitute motion is before the committee the committee must decide which of the two motions the original motion or the substitute motion to consider the committee must vote on the question a yes vote favors considering the substitute motion a no vote favors considering the original motion the committee must then discuss and vote on the selected motion k quorum at all committee meetings a majority of the appointed members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business but a smaller number

the use and availability of storm sewer facilities charges by this chapter the city elects to exercise such authority b findings and purpose in providing for such charges the following findings and determinations are made 1 in the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote the public health safety convenience and general welfare the city has constructed operated and maintained a storm sewer system the system this chapter is adopted in the further exercise of that authority 2 the system as constructed heretofore has been financed and paid for imposition of special assessments and ad valorem taxes the financing methods were appropriate to the circumstances at the time they were used it is now necessary and desirable to provide an alternative method of recovering some or all of the future costs of operating maintaining and improving the system imposition of charges as provided in this section 3 in imposing charges it is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable taking into account the status of completion of the system past methods of recovering system costs and other relevant factors it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for some or all of the future costs of operating maintaining and improving the system on the basis of the expected stormwater runoff from the various parcels of land within the city 4 assigning costs and making charges based upon expected typical storm sewer runoff cannot be done with mathematical precision but can only be accomplished

hindering the ability of the city to provide adequate water sewage flood control and other community services the purpose of the ordinance is to promote preserve and enhance the natural resources within the city and protect them from adverse effects occasioned by nonstormwater discharges by regulating discharges that would have an adverse and potentially irreversible impact on water quality

030912005 1571 findings  it is hereby determined that a land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition  and b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants  and c stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites therefore the city establishes this set of water
