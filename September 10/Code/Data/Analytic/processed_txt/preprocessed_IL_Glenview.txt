austin texas seattle washington oklahoma city oklahoma cleveland ohio and beaumont texas and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota based on such information the village board finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities such as prostitution and muggings study conducted in beaumont texas that are typically uncontrolled by the licensees of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism in the village to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 the final report of the us attorney generals commission on pornography 1985 at pages 14731476 found that sexual acts occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing private or semiprivate booths or cubicles at sexually oriented businesses encourages sexual activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses report by community defense counsel protecting communities from sexually oriented businesses november 2002 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b nona nonb amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 there have been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states and in illinois us centers for disease control hivaids surveillance report hiv infection and aids in the united states 200 idph hivaids surveillance report april 2005 8 according to the illinois department of public health as of april 200 there have been 31 789 reported cases of aids in the state of illinois since 1981 as of april 200 there have been 13305 newly reported cases of hiv in illinois 9 according to the us centers for disease control the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onethird of a million cases being reported in 2003 10 the surgeon general of the united states in a report of  advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 11 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts according to the surgeon generals call to action to promote sexual health and responsible sexual behavior dated  nearly twothirds of the 774467 aids cases reported since 1987 were sexually transmitted 12 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the licensees of the establishments to selfregulate those activities and maintain the facilities within their establishments 13 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 14 studies have shown that arrests for sexual crimes and locations of adult businesses are directly related phoenix arizona planning committee 1979 and that significantly higher crime rates were associated with an area containing multiple adult businesses minneapolis minnesota 198 and austin texas special program division report on adult oriented businesses in austin 1986 15 studies have shown that adult entertainment businesses located in residential areas tend to experience increased crime frequency compared to adult entertainment businesses in commercial areas study by the indianapolis division of planning adult entertainment businesses in indianapolis an analysis 1984 16 the findings noted in subsections 1 15 above raise substantial governmental concerns for the health safety and welfare of the citizens who live and work in and visit the village 17 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the holders of sexually oriented business licenses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the holders of sexually oriented business licenses to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the village it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and the activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on video or liveviewing booths and requiring lighting of sufficient intensity to illuminate the video or liveviewing booth to not less than ten foot candles as measured at the floor level advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article xxiii is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license or a sexually oriented business employee license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article xxiii 24 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the village will be

6172008   472011 division 3  street frontages purpose and intent each downtown street has been assigned a street frontage designation to define an optimal building envelope and public realm using setbacks sidewalk and street widths and other design parameters along with design standards  the required street sidewalk and building relationships are intended to foster new development that enhances and expands the traditional main street scale of downtown figure 32 street frontages assigns designations to all street frontages in downtown and establishes a building line for each frontage exh a 6172008 building line  the building line is a buildto line that will help establish consistent streetwalls sidewalk widths and streetscape zones see figures 31 and 32  relationship of building line to rightofway or property line the building line may differ from the current location of a rightofway or property line in these cases because the building line must be built to the rightofwayproperty lines will need to be adjusted of property between the property owner and village more specifically the property owner may need to dedicate property to the public rightofway to create the desirable street and streetscape width or the village may transfer rightofway to the buildable development site 1 for glenview road the building line is intended to eventually bring all buildings more in line with an 18foot sidewalk width east of the river and a common 15foot sidewalk width west of the river 2 for waukegan road the building line is intended to eventually eliminate parking lots in front of buildings and bring buildings closer to the sidewalk to better frame the street reduce its perceived width and scale and establish this roadway as a physical part of the traditional downtown starting at lake avenue the code also incorporates foundation landscaping in front of allresidential buildings and a landscaped median in the center of waukegan road to provide a green attractive entrance to the downtown 3 for residential buildings along waukegan road the building line provides room for a consistent sidewalkstreetscape space that will accommodate foundation landscaping in front of buildings  where the building line designated in this from the subdivision the provisions of the downtown development apply exh a 6172008 street standards  purpose and intent the street standards defined for each street frontage delineate street and sidewalk conditions that will establish a more attractive pedestrianoriented shopping environment 1 over time desired or common sidewalk widths will be established to create a more regular walking experience from block to block that incorporates a minimum 5foot free zone walking area and additional space for street trees plantings in raised planters or parkways 2 developers are required to install villageapproved streetscape elements for new developments  required all developments within the downtown district must comply with the s street standards exh a 6172008 street frontages the five designations are see figure 32   where street frontage designations change along a street either designation can be applied for a maximum of 75 feet in either direction along that frontage developments on corner lots should use standards for the buildings primary street and standards for the side street frontage exh a 6172008 glenview road corridor  purpose and intent the glenview road corridor is applied to downtown glenviews traditional shopping street this stretch of glenview road has a pedestrianoriented main street character and the downtown revitalization plan and development to enhance this character by providing a consistent building streetwall and a streetscapesidewalk zone that allows ample room for walking shopping outdoor dining and landscaping  streetsidewalk standards the building line for the glenview road corridor frontage shown in figures 33 and 34  provides two distinct streetscapesidewalk zones 1 west of the river the building line creates an optimal 80foot rightofway to provide a uniform streetwall from the river to washington although some variation may occur to accommodate sight lines at the railroad tracks and at intersections see figure 33 and 35  2 east of the river the building line creates an optimal 110foot rightofway this provides a larger streetscapesidewalk zone because of the large street crosssection and acts as a transition between the waukeganglenview intersection and the narrower crosssection west of the river see figures 34 and 38  3 glenview roadwest of river on glenview road west of the river the desired sidewalkstreetscape zone is 15 feet within this space required street trees can be placed in decorative tree grates to match the villages standard grate or in 18inch tall planters that help separate pedestrians and vehicular traffic creating a sense of safety see figures 36 and 37 4 glenview roadeast of river the desired sidewalkstreetscape zone on glenview road east of the river is 18 feet from curb to building which would accommodate streetscaping such as street trees in tree grates or 18inch raised planters while maintaining a sufficient clear zone for walking and shopping a wider streetscape is desired because of glenview roads larger street width in this location the 18foot sidewalk will also act as a transition from the 18foot streetscapesidewalk zone desired on waukegan road see figures 39 and 310  building setbacks a front yard zero buildto at least 60% of the groundfloor front facade must be

that provides an entrance into downtown glenviews main shopping area south of grove street this corridor is envisioned as an extension of the pedestrianoriented shopping environment found on glenview road north of grove street this corridor should provide an attractive mixeduse gateway into the downtown retail core the development to both accommodate auto traffic and enhance the pedestrian environment along waukegan road establishing a consistent streetwall with an ample sidewalkstreetscape is the main priority for this frontage following a common building line and prohibiting offstreet parking in front of buildings will allow waukegan road to be framed over time with building streetwalls see figure 314 and 315   streetsidewalk standards the building line in the waukegan road

design standards are intended to maintain and enhance the physical character of downtown by encouraging development proposals that strive for highquality design exh a 6172008 village character although these standards do not mandate or endorse one particular style of architecture they do recognize the value of downtown glenviews traditional historic revival architecture and its identity as an upscale north shore commuter railway village the standards encourage development that respects the villages history fits in with highquality adjacent structures and enhances downtowns overall architectural character exh a 6172008 objectives site and building design should enhance downtowns electric character by  fostering a built over time appearance with variations in facades building height and rooflines  articulating buildings with detailed fenestration highquality materials signage and lighting  incorporating attractive yearround streetscapelandscape elements  incorporating environmentally sensitive sustainable design where feasible exh a 6172008 context the design of each development whether it consists of one or multiple buildings will be reviewed by village boards and commissions for its suitability for a given site compatibility with adjacent development and consistency with the goal of improving the design quality of glenviews built environment in addition other plans and development regulations affect development in downtown glenview the comprehensive plan provides goals and objectives and a landuse direction for the entire village the downtown revitalization plan sets a new direction for the improvement and development of the area the downtown development its design standards seek to implement the revitalization plan by providing
