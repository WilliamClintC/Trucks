overriding in relation to price in procurement of technical supplies or technical or professional services b whether the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities and what priorities should be given these requirements in the citys best interest c whether a fixed price or cost type contract is more advantageous d whether the market place

experiences of other counties and municipalities including but not limited to troup county georgia  saint paul minnesota  houston austin and amarillo texas  and phoenix arizona  which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the city and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before us the mayor and council take note of the wellknown and selfevident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality which do not vary greatly among communities within our country c moreover it is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity either partial or total under certain circumstances particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in socalled nude bars or establishments offering socalled nude entertainment or adult entertainment leads to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions blight and diminution in property values in the same manner establishments offering photographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community d among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol live commercial nudity in general and photographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct prostitution solicitation drug trafficking drug use and corruption of public officials among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol commercial nudity in general and photographic adult entertainment are depression of property values acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described e furthermore it is the finding of the mayor and council that other forms of adult entertainment including but not limited to adult bookstores peep shows adult theaters and massage parlors have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in neighborhoods commercial districts and urban life in general f accordingly it is in the best interest of the health welfare safety and morals of the community to reduce the adverse impact of adult entertainment establishments by limiting the number of such uses so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment establishments or adult uses upon other business uses neighborhood property values residential areas and public and semipublic uses to ensure that adult uses and adult entertainment establishments do not impede development redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts and so as to avoid allowing adult entertainment and adult uses in heavily used public pedestrian areas g therefore the limitation of adult uses and adult entertainment establishments to certain prescribed areas of the city is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment or adult uses h while it is recognized that such regulation as is established by this article cannot de facto approach prohibition as a protected form of expression would

first 90 days from the enactment of the ordinance from which this section is derived that such meter or meters are not installed or if installed not accurately recording flows the sewer charge will be based on the average percentage of flows calculated upon the previous three months flows if after 90 days the meter or meters are not installed or if installed are not operational the sewer charge will be based on 100 percent of the volume of water purchased if a sewer meter shows incorrect or suspected incorrect flows over four times in one 12month period then for the next 12month period the

is recommended 3 after the rope is threaded line connect the pull rope to the mandrel and place the mandrel in the entrance of the pipe 4 connect a second rope to the back of the mandrel this will enable the mandrel to be retrieved if excessive deflection is encountered 5 draw the mandrel sewer line 6 an increasing resistance to pull is an indication of excessive deflection if this occurs mark

stormwater management for new development and redevelopment introduction it is hereby determined that land development projects and other land use conversions and their associated changes to land cover permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes which in turn increase flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition  land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters  the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety public and private property drinking water supplies recreation fish and other aquatic life property values and other uses of lands and waters  these adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas the preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged use of incentives or credits the georgia greenspace program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits  localities in the state of georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution  therefore the city of villa rica has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of postdevelopment stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation it has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate postdevelopment stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes postconstruction soil erosion and sedimentation stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with postdevelopment stormwater runoff cco  att 512018 801  general provisions 8011 purpose and intent the purpose of this ordinance is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment it has been determined that proper management of postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public
