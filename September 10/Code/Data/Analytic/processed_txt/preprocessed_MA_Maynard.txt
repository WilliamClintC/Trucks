substantial waiver of significant monetary value to the applicant the waiver is being granted in return for concessions or amenities by the applicant that are being provided to the town for the good of the town not just for residents of the proposed subdivision and which are of similar import or value to the town as the waiver is to the applicant e the granting of a waiver of the length of a culdesac a does not allow more lots than would otherwise be allowed on a culdesac of the maximum allowable length b is the minimum length that could be allowed and still result in a design that is superior to the same number of lots on a shorter culdesac c does not according to consultation with the fire chief result in a reduction or compromise of the fire departments ability to provide emergency services to the residents of the development in any way it must be noted that a waiver of the maximum length of a culdesac should not be considered a foregone conclusion by the applicant

holding a further public hearing design review standards a purpose the planning board shall use the following guidelines and standards in administering design review as described of the zbl the objective of the design review is to maintain coherence and harmony with the existing buildings in the immediate area and the neighborhood that exhibit historic andor high quality design features that the planning board believes defines the best of area architecture the following guidelines have been organized into two related sections  overall guidelines these are general considerations that shall apply to any project  specific guidelines these concern the elements of a building and its site that might be affected by a proposed project such as storefronts lighting roofs materials signage and the like b overall guidelines building improvements should respect a buildings original style or type where the building is of historic merit or where the original building design is of high quality and distinctive character the industrial revolution and the building styles that were used during this period are of great significance in maynard and several structures typical of this period remain restoration of these facades to reflect their original character to the greatest extent possible is a fundamental goal building renovations should be harmonious with the original structure in form style and materials whenever possible building improvements should not be designed to mimic historical features that are inappropriate to the original character of the building previous building renovations which have taken place over the course of time are sometimes evidence of the history of a building and its environment if these alterations have acquired their own significance they should be recognized and respected 1 if original building elements have been removed or substantially altered over time contemporary treatments are not discouraged however they should retain traditional principles and be of a character appropriate to the area 2 new buildings may have a contemporary character that is respectful of and composed with traditional and attractive design elements materials colors facade organization and proportions buildings designed in accurate historical architectural styles are recommended 3 new building design should reflect a longterm contribution to the areas architecture and should be planned in such a manner as to not preclude a variety of tenants from occupying the structure over the course of time building styles not easily adapted to future reuse are strongly discouraged maynard planning board rules and regulations including fee schedule and applications approved  revised august 14th 2018 maynard planning board rules and regulations 4 distinguishing original qualities and character defining features of a building or structure and its environment should be preserved  elements that make a building special should be identified and preserved if at all possible 5 facade designs that relate to the historic town character of maynard are encouraged in general businesses should rely on signage not on signature or symbolic building elements to advertise themselves and to attract patrons 6 standardized or generic designs are to be avoided within an overall framework of consistent and coherent general principles variety in the commercial environment is encouraged c peer review for design standards the planning board may at its own discretion opt to utilize a design professional to conduct a peer review of projects the determination to utilize outside professional peer review will normally but not always be made at the preapplication meeting the applicant is solely responsible for all professional costs incurred for peer review d specific guidelines in each of the following subsections the standard represents the conditions that must be met by all development that are subject to design review while the recommended approach represents one way of satisfying the standard through the site plan approval process the planning board may permit alternative site planning and building design approaches provided that it finds that such alternative approaches address the required standard as well as or better than the recommended approach 1 facades exterior walls and details standard  buildings should have human scale architectural features and patterns  their height orientation and massing should be respectful of and in proportion to pedestrians that pass along the downtown streetscape the elements should be integral parts of the building fabric and not superficially applied trim or graphics or paint facades visible from a public way should be articulated or use other techniques to reduce the massive scale and the uniform appearances of large buildings facades along main and nason streets should pay particular attention to exterior detailing that encourages pedestrian interest and activity  new building and facade designs should be similar to the immediate neighbors and historic site organization with primary orientation towards the streets and doors and windows adjacent to sidewalks facades and visible roofs should strive to be visually interesting and attractive along areas that will be seen by the public  a unified architectural style should be determined for each project and used consistently for all elements of a building wall and roof however in the case of a use which is housed in multiple buildings the underlying integrity of each building should be preserved to the extent that historic qualities remain proportions of building elements should respect the architectural styles with which they are composed in addition to details and materials building doors and windows should be designed to be consistent in proportion size and configuration with the architectural styles that are determined to be appropriate for the building recommended approach  building facades should include a repeating pattern that should include color change texture change and materials change at least one of these elements should repeat horizontally all elements should repeat at intervals of no more than thirty 30 feet either horizontally or vertically patterns can include architectural or structural bays change in plane no less than 12 inches in width such as an offset reveal or projecting rib maynard planning board rules and regulations including fee schedule and applications approved  revised august 14th 2018 maynard planning board rules and regulations  the massing of large buildings should reflect the functions of the building and respond to the scale of traditional buildings by including major faade elements which help to break the building into smaller pieces with distinctive appearances individual buildings and their storefronts should appear distinct even when a single use spans multiple storefronts  facades which are visible from a public way and greater than 100 feet in length measured horizontally should a incorporate wall plane projections or recesses having a depth of at least 3% of the length of the facade so that no uninterrupted facade should exceed 100 horizontal feet  or b incorporate other types of articulation facades displays materials or texture which meets the above standard  ground floor facades that face public streets should have arcades display windows entry areas awnings or other such features along no less than 60 percent of their horizontal length the street level facade of commercial storefronts should be transparent between the height of three feet and eight feet above the walkway grade see storefronts  blank walls without any visual content or interest should be avoided along pedestrian sidewalks and parking areas and on front facades in general a historic roof forms should be retained or restored additions should have roof forms that are compatible with the forms of the building to which they are attached new structures should employ simple roof forms compatible with the flat or gable roof styles typical of the maynard commercial areas b downspouts and gutters should be of a color that is compatible with the building walls if the building is historic the style and color of downspouts and gutters should be appropriate to the original character of the facade 2 windows doors and entryways standard  windows should respect spacing and size patterns appropriate to the architectural style that is chosen for either renovation or new construction in general numerous smaller window openings are preferred for upper stories of buildings lower story windows should be appropriate for the uses behind them but transparency and indication of activity are important in general if not a storefront it is preferable to have verticallyoriented windows  primary entrances are a principal element of orientation and connectivity to the street and should be designed appropriately  they should concentrate visible activity and interest toward the street  large retail buildings should feature multiple entrances multiple building entrances break up large walls reduce walking distances from cars facilitate pedestrian access from public sidewalks and provide convenience where certain entrances offer access to individual stores or identified departments of a store entryway design elements and variations should give orientation and definition to the building recommended approach  whenever possible the original window patterns of a building should be restored or retained  avoid blocking reducing or changing any original and appropriate pattern of windows when renovating older buildings repairing existing historic windows with inkind materials is preferable to replacement when existing historic windows are irreparable replacement windows should strive to replicate existing historic window details maynard planning board rules and regulations including fee schedule and applications approved  revised august 14th 2018 maynard planning board rules and regulations  an individual punched window expression rather than continuous horizontal or vertical strip windows is encouraged whenever possible and appropriate to the building style windows with multiple small panes which emulate historic windows should be avoided unless they are historically accurate and appropriate to the primary style of the building such glazing was seldom used during many historical periods and is often used inappropriately to convey a colonial appearance  larger scale windows should be used at the ground level  transparent glazing should be used and reflective or dark tinted glass avoided opaque panels such as painted metal or spandrel glass should not be used to replace vision glazing in windows  shutters should be employed only if they are consistent with the architectural style of the faade shutters should not be employed with casementstyle windows bay windows broad picture pairedgrouped or display windows  doors o primary entrances should be largely transparent as is traditionally the case with storefront design this will promote a sense of welcome and safe access o street numbers should be located near the front address and be of adequate size and distinctive color to be visible to the passing motorist the street number should not be located so that it is obscured when the front door is open o any special loading and service entrances should be screened from streets other public ways and adjacent properties if it is not possible to screen such areas entirely they should be visually minimized to the greatest extent possible o unused entrances should be transformed into other architectural elements appropriate to the architectural style of the building such as a store window o entrances shall meet the requirements of the massachusetts architectural access regulations o the addition of rear entrances display windows or other improvements is encouraged in order to increase interest and access to uses o historic door material and hardware should be restored or repaired where possible repair should match existing size design profile and configuration o screen and storm doors should be wood when appropriate to the building and kept as simple as possible horizontal and vertical rails of screen doors should align and coincide with those of the doors behind o aluminum doors and aluminum screen doors are not recommended o divided lighte doors or side lights should be employed only if appropriate for the style of the building facade o drop ceilings should not be visible from the public street or sidewalk  entryways o the sides of a principal building that abut a public street or large parking lot should have at least one customer entrance or a pedestrian arcade that brings pedestrians around the building to the entrance o each principal building and each store within a building should have at least one clearly defined highly visible customer entrance featuring no less than three of the following canopies or porticos overhangs recessesprojections arcades raised corniced parapets over the door peaked roof forms arches outdoor patios display windows architectural details which are integrated into the building structure such as tile work and moldings or integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped areas andor places for sitting maynard planning board rules and regulations including fee schedule and applications approved  revised august 14th 2018 maynard planning board rules and regulations 3 materials and colors standard  in general high quality materials should be used that convey substance and integrity the use of materials that are traditional and historically typical to maynard is encouraged this includes an emphasis on brick and clapboard for renovations or reconstructions exterior materials should be consistent with the historic style which is used to compose the facade  the goal of these guidelines is to encourage the use of traditional quality materials for both appearance and durability the use of authentic materials rather than imitations is strongly encouraged this guideline is intended to discourage materials that are typical of low cost and low quality construction or appear to be masking or patching an underlying facade material recommended approach  predominant exterior building materials should be high quality materials and include but not be limited to brick wood granite native stone and tinted textured or concrete masonry units  facade colors should be low reflectance using appropriate historic palates or neutral or earth tone colors  building trim and accent areas may feature brighter colors including primary colors  the consistent use of a dominant building material for the facade is encouraged rather than multiple materials such as brick and clapboard combinations  where possible materials used to patch or repair existing facades should match original desirable materials as closely as possible  designs should use traditional or historic materials rather than imitation materials such as composite siding plastic roof tiles or veneer brick  if metal is used it should be appropriate to the building and convey a sense of quality to assure an attractive appearance over time  materials used near sidewalks and adjacent to the entrance should be durable and compatible with other building materials  plywood or other wood panel sheathing materials should be avoided unless they are incorporated as a panel within a frame and are durable for exterior use  minor decorative elements such as facade ornaments decorative fasteners or small accents can be of any rigid durable material that will be in harmony with the faade and the architectural style of the structure 4 rear and sides standard  architectural and landscaping features should mitigate the impacts of rear and sides of buildings which otherwise present a view of blank walls loading areas storage areas hvac units garbage receptacles and other such features where the rear and sides of buildings front on public streets andor other public spaces eg parks or parking lots they should incorporate additional entries and attractive architectural treatments that mimic the quality of the front faade recommended approach  where space allows greater landscape buffers screening and fencing than is otherwise required in the zoning should be used but in no way impede views of the assabet river where the facade faces adjacent residential uses and space allows enhanced screening shall be provided consistent with the landscape regulations maynard planning board rules and regulations including fee schedule and applications approved  revised august 14th 2018 maynard planning board rules and regulations 5 central pedestrianscale features standard  buildings should offer pedestrianscale features and amenities entrances and parking lots should be configured to be functional with walkways conveniently tied to logical destinations bus stops and dropoffpickup points should be considered as integral parts of the design pedestrian ways should be branded by special design features such as towers arcades porticos pedestrian light fixtures bollards planter walls alternative paving materials and other architectural elements that define circulation ways and outdoor spaces represent contextappropriate public infrastructure recommended approach  each project subject to these standards should contribute to community and public spaces by providing at least two of the following outdoor benches or seating window shopping walkway outdoor playground kiosks water feature or other such deliberately shaped area andor a focal feature or amenity that enhances such community and public spaces any such areas should have direct access to the public sidewalk network and such features should not be constructed of materials that are inferior to the principal materials of the building and landscape 6 signage awnings canopies and marquees standard  signage shall be consistent with of the zbl  consistent with the zbl the planning board is also empowered to grant relief issuance of a special permit  awnings canopies and marquees with a traditional design and appearance are encouraged as facade elements when they serve to protect pedestrians from the sun and rain provide a secondary location for signage add color and interest to building storefronts and facades and add emphasis to display windows and doorways awnings should reflect the overall facade organization and storefront locations of a building traditional and simple shapes are encouraged rather than unusual or contemporary profiles recommended approach  awnings on a multiple storefront building should be consistent in character but need not be identical  awnings should be located within the building elements framing individual storefront openings  awnings of a round or bullnose shape should be avoided unless used for a single door or window opening that is not part of a framed storefront  the rigid framework for awnings canopies or marquees should be no lower than 8 feet above the sidewalk under it per massachusetts building fabric panels of awnings should be no lower than 7 feet above the sidewalk  backlit awnings should not be used  awnings shall be made of soft fabrics such as canvas 7 storefront standard  storefronts refer to those portions of the facade which directly relate to the street and the maynard planning board rules and regulations including fee schedule and applications approved  revised august 14th 2018 maynard planning board rules and regulations interior activities in some cases the storefront may include the side or back of the building most facades consist of an architectural framework designed intentionally for one or more storefronts to occur the storefront design should complement the framework and not expand beyond it  storefronts should be consistent in style with the building architecture where possible provide clarity and interest to the facade provide for a high level of transparency and be harmonious with other adjacent storefronts it is also important that the distinction between the storefront and the rest of the building facade should be maintained displays in street front windows that add color texture information or visual activity to the pedestrian experience are encouraged recommended approach  storefront display windows that display products or services signs with the name of the organization local business logos hours public service messages or displays or views to an activity in which people are involved frequently during hours of operation are encouraged  dark tinted or opaque reflective glassfilms should be avoided  where a storefront does not serve a retail use and transparency is not practical window treatments should be employed to create an attractive appearance that promotes aesthetic harmony with the surrounding area and maintains storefront character  a horizontal band or frieze that serves as a signage band should be incorporated at the top of storefronts  base panel and sill courses are traditional for many architectural styles where it is appropriate for the existing or proposed architectural style a base panel and sill course should be provided the base panels and sill course should continue across the entire width of the storefront bay and terminate at doors or the vertical elements framing the bay the base panel and sill course should be a maximum of 24 measured above the sidewalk  incorporating a glazed transom with the building address above the door is encouraged when storefront heights are sufficient to allow for it  storefront window transoms should be consistent with door transoms  it is preferable to maintain substantial storefront glazing and provide attractive window treatments to avoid blank facades along the sidewalk 8 building systems standard  the components of building mechanical electrical and plumbing systems should be concealed from view wherever possible the visual impact of those building systems and equipment which cannot be concealed should be minimized on building facades exposed elements of building systems which cannot be hidden recessed or screened should be blended sympathetically with the building facade recommended approach  rooftop mechanical equipment should be completely screened by the building parapet wall so as not to be visible from any street public way  air conditioning units should not be placed into windows or any other openings visible from the street units located in nonwindow openings are appropriate if they are screened with a grille within the storefront or facade or building wall maynard planning board rules and regulations including fee schedule and applications approved  revised august 14th 2018 maynard planning board rules and regulations miscellaneous a safe harbor valuation of open space the purpose of this section is to establish a safe harbor amount for zbl for acquisition and preservation of open space or recreation land  the town of maynard protective zoning bylaws allows for developers to reduce the minimum lot requirements for residential units in the downtown overlay district if they are issued a special permit and if there is a development agreement that includes among other things a donation for the acquisition and preservation of open space or recreation land  because there is a need for a consistent and fair determination of the value of such donation the community preservation committee recommends that a safe harbor value of such donation be established as noted below1 further the cpc recommends that a developer providing the value of this safe harbor amount be considered compliant with the provisions of a donation for the acquisition and preservation of open space or recreation land  the value of the for acquisition and preservation of open space or recreation land is to be determined by multiplying a base acquisition cost per household by the number of applicable units o the fy19 base acquisition cost per household is $9400 o the number of applicable units is equal to the difference between the projects total number of residential units and the number of units otherwise allowed without the acquisition cost per household will be increased by an inflation factor of 20 percent annually unless the planning board specifies a different inflation factor any such adjustments by the planning board to the inflation factor shall be in effect at the start of the next fiscal year example a project proposes to increase the allowed number of units from 5 to 7 under the number of applicable units is therefore 2 the safe harbor donation amount is therefore $9400x2  $18800 1text approved by community preservation committee on   it was subsequently modified by planning board on  2 this amount was determined using maynards current average number acres of open space and recreation land per household 015 multiplied by the current assessed value per acre of the golf course land $62800 the golf course land is the most recent open space and recreation land acquired by the town the valuation of the golf course land used in the calculation excludes the value of the clubhouse and parking lot the current acreage of open space and recreation land used in the calculation excludes the wildlife refuge lands

preservation introduction maynard like many other classic new england mill towns is rich with history with the tremendous growth and success of the textile mill built by amory maynard in 184 the towns population boomed and maynard blossomed into a thriving industrial community many citizens today can still trace their family lines back to firstgeneration immigrant mill workers hints of the past remain in maynards historic buildings including the renovated mill complex at mill & main the reused old fowler school at art space the gruber brothers furniture building and fine arts movie theater since receiving its first town warrant in 187 maynard has grown into a vibrant community that combines an active downtown area with the values of a smalltown suburb as maynard continues to grow it is crucial that its historic sites are preserved and protected a communitys historic sites are fundamentally important to its character and identity many townspeople who have lived in maynard their entire lives also feel connected to their genealogical history towns historic sites each year the fifth grade at fowler school embarks on a walking tour of historic maynard by exploring maynards historic buildings these children learn about the past and the town in which they live the identification preservation and protection of the towns historic sites can forward education efforts and foster an appreciation of the towns history and resources for maynard citizens young and old historic preservation can also be economically beneficial as the renovation of historic properties has been shown to promote and increase business activity in commercial areas maynards economy depends heavily on small businesses who can benefit from historic preservation historic preservation could also provide the town with new sources of income such as housing and businesses when provisions are made so that private developers can repurpose historic buildings in a way that is both economical and efficient preservation becomes a winwin for both the town and the developer historic preservation is defined as the protection conservation and restoration of historic sites this handbook will explain the processes of historic preservation and make suggestions for the town to further its dedication to historic preservation efforts a list of resources including grants is also included to aid in the preservation process historic preservation in the united states local governments play an important role in the process of historic preservation historic preservation can provide communities with direct fiscal and social benefits but also furthers local identity by embracing the past however historic preservation in a city or town is just a small part of a greater picture as it is largely overseen by divisions of the federal government much of the historic preservation in america is overseen by the department of the interior the department establishes nationwide standards for preservation rehabilitation 3 restoration and reconstruction and protects hundreds of historic properties national park service since its foundation in 191 the park service has designated preserved and maintained important natural and historic sites throughout the united states many of its programs including federal tax incentives and the national register of historic places are important preservation tools for american communities please see pages 610 for more information on federal preservation programs likewise each state also plays a role in managing its own historic preservation in massachusetts historic preservation is regulated by the massachusetts historical commission chaired by the secretary of the commonwealth the massachusetts historical commission directs programs such as the certified local government program and the state register of historic places which benefit communities with historic assets it also provides financial assistance in the form of tax credits and grants please see pages 1114 for more information on state preservation programs however the first level of historic preservation in the united states is local preservation divisions of the local government typically lead preservation efforts in maynard the town charter established the maynard historical commission which coordinates with the federal state and local governments to direct preservation efforts in town private organizations such as the maynard historical society and friends of the maynard library also aid preservation efforts by providing financial assistance sharing resources and educating the broader community more information on local preservation efforts can be found on pages 1519 although historic preservation operates on many different levels each level can benefit a town like maynard successfully ensuring the preservation of any towns historic sites involves requires identifying understanding and utilizing many resources of each level federal state and local as well as private funding opportunities what is considered historic there is a fine line between what is considered historic and what is simply considered old not all old buildings are deemed worthy of historic preservation according to the national register of historic places historic buildings should hold some significance including but not limited to association with important people or events the homes of amory and lorenzo maynard which still stand today are considered historic because of their ties to the maynard family the maynard family was not only the namesake of the town but also held prominent roles within the community and town government amory maynard was even the towns first postmaster architectural or artistic significance one historic building in maynard which meets this criteria is the coolidge school the coolidge school was partially built by the master architect charles bateman famous for his work throughout the greater boston area the coolidge school also exemplifies the architectural style known as classical revival the classical revival movement was inspired by grecoroman art and architecture and became widely popular in the 19th century 4 providing new information about the past archaeological sites are generally historic because they may yield new information about the past similarly a newlydiscovered site could be considered historic because of potential information it might hold glenwood cemetery in maynard which is the towns only nationallyrecognized historic property is one example of a site that might possess archaeological resources of exceptional importance to community state or country the most notable example of this criteria in maynard is the former mill at clock tower place recently rechristened mill & main the mill is historic not only because of its ties to families in the community but because of its reflection of a greater trend throughout the united states the mill exemplifies the transformative process of industrialization underwent by america during the 19th century the community of maynard was just one of thousands of communities throughout new england that adopted this new technology and thrived because of it maynards booming immigrant population as a result of the mill also reflected a nationwide trend therefore the mill is historic because it was part of an important moment in american history although this handbook focuses on the preservation and protection of historic buildings not all historic sites must be buildings to meet these criteria natural formations areas of land and graveyardscemeteries could all be considered historic under the right conditions likewise not all old buildings are considered historic a home built in the 1920s is not historic simply because of the time in which it was built it may however be historic because of its particular architectural features or a former resident of note 5 national preservation in the united states the federal government is the highest branch on the tree of historic preservation divisions of the federal government such as the national park service oversee much of the historic preservation in this country washington performs preservation tasks such as passing federal laws publishing guidelines and awarding special recognition to properties of note among other duties additionally some private nonprofit organizations operate on a national level like the national trust for historic preservation below you will find a sampling of national preservation resources provided both by the federal government and by nonprofits the secretary of the interiors guidelines for preserving rehabilitating restoring and reconstructing old buildings in the united states preservation is overseen at the federal level by the department of the interior which handles many of the domestic affairs in this country as such it is the responsibility of the secretary of the interior to establish federal policy on historic preservation to help preservationists determine the best course of action for an historic building the secretary of the interior has published a set of guidelines for preserving rehabilitating restoring and reconstructing old buildings they are paraphrased below according to the secretary of the interior preservationists have four options or treatment approaches when determining the future of an historic building preservation favors the conservation of the buildings historic character use of original materials maintenance and repair rehabilitation assumes that a building is more deteriorated prior to treatment and therefore allows more leeway for the replacement of old materials however like preservation rehabilitation stresses the importance of conserving the original features materials and style of the building  ie its historic character restoration retains and replaces materials to return the appearance of the building to its most significant period of history unlike preservation or rehabilitation it permits the removal of materials not belonging to this time period finally reconstruction allows preservationists to recreate a destroyed or no longer existing site using allnew materials to determine which of these four options best suits the property at hand the secretary of the interior asks preservationists to consider four main considerations in addition to the buildings historical significance relative importance in history for example national historic landmarks often undergo preservation or restoration while buildings belonging to an historic district more frequently experience rehabilitation physical condition sometimes though we would like to preserve a building preservation is simply not an option due to the buildings present physical condition preservation is a viable option when most of the buildings original materials and features 6 remain intact but when extensive repairs are necessary rehabilitation may be a more feasible choice proposed use most historic buildings can be adapted to a new use see adaptive reuse pages 2627 without compromising their historic character but some specialized buildings  such as grain silos forts or windmills  are less easily adapted therefore both the original and proposed uses of a building are important considerations mandated code requirements regardless of what treatment is pursued code requirements must be taken into consideration as the project proceeds however sometimes coderequired actions can jeopardize the historic character of a building mandated changes to the building  such as system upgrades or accessibility requirements  should affect the buildings historic appearance as little as possible by following these guidelines preservationists can identify the most appropriate actions to be taken to protect a specific historic building the secretary of the interiors standards for rehabilitation the secretary of the interior has published ten standards for rehabilitation which must be observed to qualify for many sources of federal and state funding the current standards  as they appear on the national park service website1  are shown below 1 a property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment 2 the historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved the removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided 3 each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time place and use changes that create a false sense of historical development such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings shall not be undertaken 4 most properties change over time  those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved 5 distinctive features finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved 6 deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature the new feature shall match the old in design color texture and other visual qualities and where possible materials replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary physical or pictorial evidence 1 national park service the secretary of the interiors standards for rehabilitation technical preservation services national park service nd web 28 jul 2015 7 7 chemical or physical treatments such as sandblasting that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used the surface cleaning of structures if appropriate shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible 8 significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved if such resources must be disturbed mitigation measures shall be undertaken 9 new additions exterior alterations or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property the new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing size scale and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment 10 new additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired these standards help to ensure the proper treatment of historic properties around the united states especially those receiving federal andor state funding national park service programs as stated previously the department of the interior administers many federal programs to help towns  like maynard  in the process of historic preservation these programs are run national park service and range from protective legislation to federal tax credits and grants national historic preservation act in 196 congress passed the national historic preservation act to set the federal policy on historic preservation the national historic preservation act required that the federal government establish various preservation programs and designate historic preservation officers through this act the federal government committed to working with state and tribal governments to better protect and maintain historic sites this act was important because it forced federal agencies to take into account their effects on our countrys historic properties this act established many programs which are still in use today  such as the national register of historic places and the certified local governments program it also created the historic preservation fund which provides the means for the united states federal historic tax credits and grants national register of historic places established by the national historic preservation act of 196 the national register of historic places is an official list of all the historic properties in the united states meeting a certain set of criteria historic sites are listed on the register nominations which are sent state and reviewed by the national park service nominations may be made by individuals or groups but require careful research and evidence demonstrating that the property meets the national registers official criteria these criteria take both the age and 8 significance of the site into consideration as well as its associations with important historical events people artistic or architectural styles etc listing on the national register of historic places is primarily an honorary designation this means it will not affect the ownership of the building nor will it ensure the buildings maintenance or preservation a threatened property is not automatically saved when it is placed on the national register of historic places however listing on the register can still provide tremendous benefits for the future preservation of a historic property for example national register listing draws attention to the importance of a site helping to convince others of its value listing on the national register earns the site a place in a public database offering important publicity and exposure it also makes the site eligible for federal tax credits federal preservation easements and grants and possible state benefits as well federal tax credits the national park service and the internal revenue service irs have partnered to offer tax credits toward the rehabilitation of historic properties in order to encourage private investment in the historic sector two tax credits are available historic and nonhistoric the former provides a 20% income tax credit for the rehabilitation of historic incomeproducing buildings  however residential properties are ineligible the latter provides a 10% tax credit toward nonhistoric properties that were in use before 1936 in order to qualify the propertys internal structural framework and internal and external walls must remain 5075% intact for more information on federal historic tax credits please contact the national park service see  historic preservation easements also offer some federal tax benefits a historic preservation easement is a legal agreement that permanently protects a historic property typically in the form of a deed easements such as these restrict the changes which can be made to a historic property these restrictions usually travel with the deed of the property so that they will still apply even if ownership of the property changes a building owner who donates an historic preservation easement may be eligible for a federal income tax deduction the national park service recommends that interested owners consult with a tax attorney or accountant for more information on these deductions national trust for historic preservation programs on  president truman signed legislation creating the national trust for historic preservation now a privatelyfunded nonprofit the national trust continues to manage twentyeight historic properties in the united states today the organization also administers several programs to aid in preservation efforts around the country the national treasures campaign the national trust for historic preservation launched their national treasures campaign in order to raise awareness and garner support for endangered historic sites the national treasures portfolio contains nationallysignificant sites that are threatened by 9 demolition closure or other forms of neglect through this program the national trust provides aid to endangered historic sites in the form of advocacy marketing planning legal assistance and more these sites honored as national treasures are listed on the national trust website where readers are invited to donate toward the trusts efforts national trust preservation grants the national trust also delegates funds to aiding preservation projects on the local level in the form of preservation grants preservation projects that are innovative help build sustainable communities and promote diversity may be eligible for a national trust grant grants typically amount to $2500$5000 and are only awarded for use in planning or educational outreach  they may not be used for rehabilitation or construction projects for more information please refer to the national trust for historic preservations website see  10 state preservation statewide preservation efforts are also important to the overall success of historic preservation as in the federal government specific divisions of the massachusetts state government deal with historic preservation issues in the commonwealth the state government can award tax credits nominate properties to the national register provide funding for preservation projects and more likewise many private organizations in massachusetts can provide grants and other forms of assistance a diverse collection of historic preservation resources available in the state of massachusetts appears below massachusetts historical commission programs in 196 the commonwealth of massachusetts enacted legislation creating the massachusetts historical commission mhc this commission comprising seventeen professionals in various preservationrelated fields was established to help identify evaluate and protect important historical and archaeological assets of the commonwealth the commission is chaired by the secretary of state and also serves as the office of the state historic preservation officer state archaeologist and state review board for historic preservation programs certified local governments the national park service has partnered with the state historic preservation office shpo to instrument the certified local governments program through this certification communities receive benefits from the federal historic preservation program such as access to a multitude of grants assistance from shpo staff and state and national park service training to be eligible as a certified local government governments must establish a qualified historic preservation commission enforce appropriate state or local legislation for the designation and protection of historic propertiesmaintain a system for the survey and inventory of local historic resources and facilitate public participation in the local preservation including participation in the national register

circuit riders since 200 preservation massachusetts has collaborated with the national trust for historic preservation to provide parttime preservation professionals to communities statewide these professionals act as a resource for developing preservation projects and strategies and can help preservationists in a small community build networks within the greater world of historic preservation currently preservation massachusetts employs two preservation circuit riders  one serves eastern massachusetts while the other serves western massachusetts to contact a preservation circuit rider please see  maynards own coolidge reuse taskforce committee enjoyed a visit from one of the preservation circuit riders  stacia caplanson  in 2015 during its deliberations over the future of the coolidge school building ms caplanson helped the taskforce committee make recommendations for the coolidge school by advising and connecting its members with preservation professionals throughout the state of massachusetts community preservation coalition the community preservation coalition was formed in 2000 under the community preservation act cpa an important piece of massachusetts legislation that facilitates historic preservation throughout the commonwealth by funding community projects see  for more information a number of aforementioned organizations help comprise the coalition including the national trust for historic preservation and preservation massachusetts since the acts passage 160 communities throughout massachusetts have adopted cpa raising a total of almost $14 billion in community preservation funding statewide the coalition has spent over $395 million since the cpas inception catalyzing more than 4000 historic preservation projects the community preservation coalition helps towns implement and enforce cpa preservation projects to contact the coalition please see pages 41 42 14 local preservation perhaps the most essential branch of historic preservation is the local level the local level is where the most direct action occurs immediately benefitting the community it is not only crucial for town governments to take measures to foster historic preservation but also for the public to be educated and enthusiastic about local preservation efforts no preservation campaign can exist without grassroots support although most of the information in this handbook focuses on action taken by local governments the importance of local publicity and community involvement cannot be emphasized enough local historical commissions local historical commissions are a valuable resource for historic preservation at a community level historical commissions  unlike historical societies which are private organizations  are lowlevel divisions of the town government dealing with questions of historic preservation since the state law was enacted in the 1960s almost every city and town in massachusetts has established a local historical commission this law found in section 8d of massachusetts general law provides conditions by which a local government may appoint and maintain its own historical commission according to the massachusetts historical commissions preservation planning manual the law identifies five key responsibilities of local historical commissions 1 research places of historic or archaeological value  2 cooperate with the state archaeologist in conducting surveys and reporting sites  3 coordinate with other preservation organizations  4 keep accurate records of the lhcs actions and file an annual report  5 maintain a membership of not less than three nor more than seven members duly appointed by the appropriate municipal official note that the law does not give the historical commission the ability to take regulatory or legislative action in the local government unless a local bylaw or ordinance is established giving the historical commission regulatory authority the historical commission may only hold an advisory role within the town government the maynard town charter established its own historical commission which meets monthly to discuss issues of historic importance within the town on the maynard town website the historical commission defines its goals as to preserve protect and develop the historic and archaeological assets of the community in recent years the commission has been working to inventory the towns historic properties in addition to restoring the fence of glenwood cemetery a state and national register property as well as the official town scale in town hall  administering the historic markers and plaques programs  and creating several walking tours  available online and at the maynard public library  which each pass historic sections of maynard the historical commission may be contacted by emailing histcom@townofmaynardnet meetings of the commission are open to the public for more information please see  15 local ordinances and bylaws local ordinances and bylaws are types of legislation enacted by the town government or municipality not by the local historical commission the massachusetts historical commission cites such legislation as the most effective method of protecting historic resources these laws safeguard historic resources from threats like demolition destruction and decay and require passage at city council or town meeting community preservation act the community preservation act cpa was approved by the massachusetts state legislature in september 2000 this law provides local and state funding for the acquisition and preservation of historic buildings and landscapes funds are sourced from local property taxes and the statewide cpa trust fund as of october 201 the state of massachusetts had already appropriated over $20 million for local historic preservation projects cpa maynard adopted the community preservation act in november 2006 after the vote passed at the annual spring town meeting in maynard the community preservation committee cpc meets twice a month to review local project proposals and appropriate funding toward these projects cpa proposals are then presented at a public hearing before being voted on at town meeting in may to contact the committee please see  the community preservation act is not specific to historic preservation in fact cpa funding may be used for four types of projects 1 community housing projects 2 historic preservation projects 3 open space projects 4 recreation projects because the use of cpa funds is always voted on at town meeting publicizing and gathering support for historic preservation projects in the town is vitally important historic preservation must be a priority for the citizens of maynard in order for local preservation projects to feel the benefits of cpa funding historic districts two types of historic districts exist in massachusetts national register districts and local historic districts national register districts established by the massachusetts historical commission national park service are primarily honorary meanwhile local historic districts are established by local bylaw or ordinance and are primarily regulatory the following section will focus on local historic districts over 220 local historic districts exist in the state of massachusetts maynard currently has none in a local historic district all properties are subject to the same set of regulations typically these regulations require that all changes to the exterior of a building are subject to 16 review by the local historic district commission established when the district is established a building permit will not be issued until the construction has been approved by the commission before a local historic district can even be considered a nomination is necessary from either the board of selectmen or a local historic organization such as a historical society or board of realtors after receiving the nomination a study committee is typically established to explore the possibility of a local historic district before proposing a historic district the committee should prepare a study report establishing the boundaries of the district and detailing the significance of the area then the ordinance should move to a public hearing where citizens of the area can hear both sides of the issue and voice their opinions from the public hearing a final report is prepared by the study committee for consideration at town meeting local historic districts may only be passed by a majority vote of town meeting or city council therefore it is important to garner public support for the cause once the vote passes at town meeting the ordinance must be submitted to the massachusetts attorney general for approval within thirty days then and only then should a local historic district commission be appointed for review of all proposed construction within the district architectural preservation districts architectural preservation districts  sometimes known as neighborhood conservation districts or architectural conservation districts can be effective alternatives to local historic districts in places where alterations have already occurred but where overall protection of the areas character remains necessary they regulate only additions major alterations demolition and new construction within the specified area to make sure that the outward character of the district is preserved therefore their standards are less binding than those of a local historic district a district commission a type of review committee enforces the terms of an architectural preservation district the commission should comprise of a combination of building professionals architects property owners and district residents the terms of architectural preservation districts often combine binding and nonbinding regulations under an architectural preservation district major construction alterations and demolition exceeding a certain percentage are subject to binding regulatory review  meaning that approval from the review committee is absolutely necessary for the activity to proceed on the other hand most minor changes to exterior features  such as windows and doors  are either exempt from review or subject to nonbinding regulatory review in the case of nonbinding regulatory review the committee may rule on the activities but approval is not necessary for construction to proceed currently maynard has no architectural preservation districts architectural preservation districts are treated as bylaws passed with a majority rule of town meeting or city council typically the bylaw is introduced by the town historical commission or by a neighborhood preservation organization the massachusetts historical commission recommends that involved parties first prepare a study report including the reasons for proposing an architectural preservation district descriptions of the historic resources in the area evidence of public opinion an outline of the terms of the bylaw and a map of the proposed 17 district such studies can be costly but thankfully there are sources of funding specific to predevelopment projects like studies such as the mhcs preservation planning fund and preservation massachusetts predevelopment loan fund see pages 1214 preservation deed restrictions preservation deed restrictions as their name might suggest are preservation restrictions written into the deed of a property this means that even when the property changes ownership the same requirements will apply sometimes these restrictions are also known as historic preservation easements  however although an easement protects an historic property in much the same way as a preservation deed restriction it does not necessarily need to be written into the deed of the property to take effect according to massachusetts general law the massachusetts historical commission must approve all preservation restrictions in addition any restrictions held by a charitable corporation or trust must also be approved by the local government deed restrictions are donated and enforced by the local government or a thirdparty organization with the agreement of the property owner many are stipulated as a condition of receiving a local state or federal grant some preservation deed restrictions expire within a few years while others last indefinitely the content of the restrictions can vary but generally they restrict alteration of specific historical features in the interior or exterior of the building with the intent to preserve the historic character andor increase the value of the property one advantage of a preservation deed restriction is its versatility no two historic properties are exactly alike  preservation deed restrictions can easily be customized to the specific needs of a property they are also especially effective in preserving the character of a property that is passing from public to private ownership countless towns throughout massachusetts  including maynard utilize preservation deed restrictions in june of 201 maynards own coolidge reuse taskforce committee recommended that preservation restrictions such as these be imposed on the coolidge school building though the future of the building remains to be seen the taskforce recognizes the importance and effectiveness of these restrictions in preserving historical properties demolition delay bylaws demolition delay bylaws are a popular option among local governments looking to preserve their historic properties such a law delays the demolition of an historic building while alternative options can be explored at present maynard has not passed a demolition delay bylaw most demolition delay bylaws take effect after the owner of a historic building applies for a demolition permit the local historical commission then reviews the application to determine the historic significance of a building if the building is not found to be historic the demolition may proceed unhindered however if the building is found to be historic the commission holds a public hearing at which the property owner may present his reasons for 18 demolishing the structure and the public may discuss finally following the hearing the historical commission votes whether or not to impose a demolition delay while most provide for a substantial six to eighteen month delay demolition delay bylaws cannot prevent demolition in its entirety demolition remains a possibility unless an alternative is identified and a compromise is reached with the property owner thus demolition delay bylaws have the most success in communities where the people are interested and involved in the future of their historic properties community support can help pressure developers or property owners to consider an alternative to demolition affirmative maintenance bylaws affirmative maintenance bylaws help protect threatened historic buildings from loss due to lack of maintenance these bylaws may take several forms but the most common form is known as a demolition by neglect bylaw demolition by neglect bylaws protect buildings that are deteriorating due to a lack of routine or major maintenance from being demolished such bylaws allow local regulatory authorities to identify threatened resources and order the building owners to take action typically the local historical commission administers the terms of the affirmative maintenance bylaw working closely with the towns code enforcement officers and building department to draft the legislation under the bylaw the historical commission identifies endangered historic properties according to a clearlydefined set of standards such the deterioration of major features or elements specified in the fire safety code then contact the building owners building owners are required to make at least the minimum repairs necessary to comply with bylaw regulations in the event that the building owner fails to make the mandated repairs the town may either levy a fine or after financing the repairs place a lien on the property this lien temporarily transfers ownership of the property to the town until the owner defrays the cost of the repairs since many building owners claim that their neglect was due to economic hardships most bylaws also make provisions for such circumstances maynard has not yet passed an affirmative maintenance bylaw the passage of an affirmative maintenance bylaw can only occur with a majority vote of the town meeting or city council though this list of bylaws may seem long it is in no way comprehensive what appears above is merely a sampling of effective preservation legislation for information regarding further types of legislation please see the massachusetts historical commissions preservation through bylaws and ordinances manual available mhc 19 sample building assessment in order to enact many of the above bylaws the massachusetts historical commission recommends that the local historical commission or other nominating organization first conducts a study or assessment sometimes the subjects of these studies are entire districts while other times they concern only specific properties studies are often conducted party preservation organizations or private consultants which may charge fees for their work a sample outline for a building assessment appears below it is modeled after tapp associates 2008 study of the coolidge school building in maynard the purpose of the building assessment was to determine the type scale and cost of necessary repairs to the coolidge school the full report is available for download on the town website under the heading coolidge reuse taskforce committee i project overview here tapp associates detailed the purpose and contents of the study in the case of the coolidge school the building owners  the maynard school department  requested an assessment of the buildings interior and exterior facilities including its various systems readers can see that the study will include findings on all of these components from their present conditions to repair cost estimates as well as the consultants recommendations as a term of the facility review tapp associates also presented its findings to the maynard school committee and provided several copies of the coolidge school building feasibility study for distribution ii general building history perhaps the most important part of studying an historic building is researching the reasons why it is historic in this section consultants provided a brief history of the construction architecture and uses of the coolidge school the building history also included evidence of prior major repairs to the school interestingly tapp associates noted that there was little documentation on the coolidge school within the town of maynard iii interior building conditions here the meat of the report begins tapp associates collected and presented information on the walls ceilings floors windows doors hardware stairs and toilets of the coolidge school each part of the interior was sorted by material ie drywall plaster and brick walls and inspected for signs of damage then tapp associates gave recommendations on what reparations couldshould be made as you can see a building assessment must be complete in order to provide the best possible picture on the status of the building 20 iv exterior envelope conditions the same process was repeated for the exterior features of the building roof overhang chimney exterior walls exterior windows entryway exterior doors entry stairs and storm drainage in the case of the roof tapp associates brought in an outside professional in roof maintenance for further consultation again observations about the building conditions and recommendations for future maintenance and repair are provided v systems overview building systems include heating cooling electricity hot water fire alarms fire suppression and technology again tapp associates brought in outside professionals in the field to consult on the conditions of the systems in the coolidge school building in this section the consultants identified a major problem of the building its lack of central air conditioning this was one of the problems that contributed to the school departments vacancy of the building in 2014 vi building accessibility for persons with disabilities maab maab stands for the massachusetts architectural access board a division of the massachusetts state government mandating by law that all persons with disabilities should have full free and safe use of all buildings and facilities here tapp associates noted problems in the coolidge schools compliance with maab regulations including its lack of an elevator and noncompliant handrails bathroom stalls and ramps the consultants also noted the need for braille signage within the building vii cmr jurisdiction cmr simply stands for the massachusetts regulations  or in other words massachusetts state law tapp associates excerpted the portions of state law that applied to the proposed renovations on the building according to the cost of renovations viii requirements summary finally tapp associates detailed the cost estimates of the proposed renovations prioritized by their urgency the renovations were given rankings numbered 14 1 meaning currently critical 2 meaning potentially critical 3 meaning necessary but not yet critical and 4 meaning recommended recommendations were also placed in categories such as functionality integrity appearance and sorted based on the primary system to which they applied most were architectural at the end of the report the recommendations were broken down in more detail from specific repairs to their cost in total the recommended renovations on the coolidge school amounted to more than $2 million 21 the type of comprehensive information in the tapp report can be incredibly useful in painting a full picture of a property during the historic preservation process for example detailed research is required by the national park service when a building is nominated for the national register of historic places additionally when establishing local historic districts and architectural preservation districts the state or local historical commissions may require a similar study before enacting the district likewise property owners  such as the maynard school committee  frequently use these studies to determine whether or not their continued use of the building is effective andor feasible whether economically physically or otherwise in the case of the tapp report the maynard school committee determined that its continued use of the coolidge school building for its administrative facilities was not feasible it vacated the building in 201 leading the town government to create the coolidge school taskforce committee whose job was to make recommendations for the future maintenance and repair of the building 22 public relations in historic preservation pr and advertisement are a critical element of any historic preservation campaign or project whether led by the town government or a private organization preservation projects need public support to thrive therefore it is crucial to involve the public in the historic preservation process local publicity is key to achieving this goal  after all if the public is unaware of their towns historic properties andor organizations it can do nothing to help or support them one way to target this need is locallevel public relations strategies to help publicize groups such as the local historic commission and their preservation projects public relations 101 the core of most pr strategies boils down to two key concepts audience and message audience refers to the target of your efforts in the case of a specific historic preservation objective sample audiences could range from the board of selectmen to the residents of a proposed historic district to a private developer hoping to demolish an historic structure however it is important to conduct more general publicity too among the residents of a town after all town residents can be the most critical audience for preservationists not only do town residents vote to enact preservation legislation but oftentimes they do not realize that preservation is an issue in their town you can imagine how difficult it is to vote when you do not know what you are voting for the rules of effective rhetoric require that you always bear in mind your audience when speaking writing or otherwise targeting it pr strategy whatever your media may be always remember who it is you want to see your campaign imagine your target audience being represented by a single individual who are they how old are they what are their interests beliefs concerns if you are hoping to target a wide range of individuals  such as an entire town full of people  this can be difficult consulting town censuses or conducting a survey can help you narrow down the identity of your target audience surveymonkey wwwsurveymonkeycom is a free online surveytaking service that you may find useful in your efforts message refers quite simply to the message you want to send to your audience what are the core beliefs of your preservation group or project what do you hope to say andor achieve with your public relations campaign whether your ultimate goal is to convince voters to enact a demolition delay bylaw or merely to generate awareness of the local historical commission it is important to clearly and concisely define your message the wisconsin historical society recommends boiling it down to a list of three to five key talking points however most importantly make your message one you believe in your message should be something you can be proud of and something you can generate honest enthusiasm for if your audience does not see that you care about historic preservation they wont see why they should care either 23 sample public relations strategies press releases a press release is a public relations announcement issued to the media in order to publicize new and noteworthy developments in your organization andor preservation project press releases cover the who what when where why and how of specific events  for example the passage of a new preservation bylaw in your town  and are submitted directly to the media newspapers radio etc for review press releases should be onetotwo pages in length and follow standard formatting typed doublespaced and bearing the proper heading when published press releases can be effective in reaching a large audience fast however press releases are subject to the editors discretion meaning that they can sometimes be overlooked in favor of more exciting news print publications though in todays internet age brochures and flyers may seem a bit oldschool they are still effective in providing a concise explanation of your organizations message however you do not need to be limited to brochures andor flyers either more creative strategies  for example a coloring book for children a word search a historic preservation dos and donts list etc  can and should be pursued one effective strategy used by the maynard historical commission in the past was the historic walking tours of maynard available for print on the town website and as brochures at the maynard public library these walking tours not only raised awareness of the historical commission but also of the towns fascinating history newsletters and email campaigns many historical organizations including the maynard historical society publish a weekly monthly or annual newsletter though it will undoubtedly reach a smaller audience than a larger media source might selfpublishing a newsletter is a great way to guarantee that your news will be seen however publishing a print newsletter can quickly become expensive if you are internetsavvy an email newsletter or campaign is one effective alternative to publishing a print newsletter one online service mailchimp will allow you to send 12000 emails to up to 2000 subscribers for free using this service you can embed a virtual signup sheet on your organizations website or use platforms such as facebook to collect subscribers social media campaigns social media campaigns are a relatively new strategy in public relations  however they can be extremely effective in targeting the younger demographic while some cannot vote themselves young people are often vocal and passionate about the issues they care about and will help generate even more publicity for your campaign social media campaigns use different online platforms to advertise for example your organization or project could launch a facebook page twitter account instagram or online discussion forum using these accounts 24 you could use photo or caption contests video contests viral sweepstakes where users leave a comment or make a post in order to enter a contest andor hashtags online search keywords denoted by the pound key symbol # to advertise another great benefit of social media is how quickly it spreads information if you are looking to reach a large broad audience of people then the web is a prime target for your pr efforts events by far events are the costliest and most demanding of these public relations strategies they require an extraordinary amount of planning in order to be effective however when pulled off right events can generate an incredible amount of publicity they allow you to interact directly with your audience so they are receiving your message straight from the source fundraising events can also be effective as they not only allow you to generate capital that can be used for your preservation projects but also allow the public to feel as if they are directly contributing to the success of these projects the maynard historical society has hosted many events in the past including lectures at the town library and talks at their annual meetings all open to the public in maynard we are also fortunate enough to host an annual town fair maynardfest renting a table at maynardfest is relatively inexpensive and allows organizations to reach a wide audience of people from in and around maynard 25 private development and historic preservation the private sector is an important component of any countrys economy comprising of various ventures owned by individuals rather than the federal state or local governments a thriving private sector is a symbol of a countrys wealth and status in the united states it is a gleaming exemplar of the capitalism we fought so hard to protect during the cold war private developers make their living off of building new properties and investing in old ones creating new businesses and new jobs and growing the countrys economy though new construction is a prominent aspect of this job the rehabilitation of historic properties is an area of interest for many developers too however some private developers are intimidated by historic properties dreading the accompanying restrictions and limitations the heavy hand of the town government some may also believe that the price of historic rehabilitation far outweighs the profit but this is simply not true private developers have no reason to fear historic properties as michael ainslie  former president of the national trust for historic preservation  once said preservation is not just saving landmarks it is an economic development strategy often historic properties are effective sustainable successful alternatives to new construction they provide privatesector developers with a new opportunity not an old burden an introduction to private development as preservationists we easily see the intrinsic value in our historic properties when we look at an historic building we see the contributions our history has made to our country our lives and our culture unfortunately private developers cannot always afford to view historic properties in this light in order to understand why private developers sometimes view a propertys historic status as a negative  and in order to counteract that opinion  we must first begin to think like them privatesector developers are in the business of buying owning and selling properties therefore they are inherently familiar with the rights that accompany the buying owning and selling of properties in the united states there are four types of property rights private ownership public open access public closed access and state ownership these forms of ownership simply concern who has the right to regulate the property be it the state a single individual a collection of individuals or some combination thereof true private ownership of a property would allow the property owner to buy develop alter and sell the property as he or she pleases though private developers typically have private ownership of their properties they still fall subject to many federal state and local regulations property owners reserve the rights to lease sell mortgage and otherwise manage their property but the state still reserves its rights to tax the property seize it for public use or repossess it in the case of death among other actions many private developers believe that because historic properties are sometimes more heavily protected by the government investing in an historic property will force them to 26 renounce more of their property rights sometimes this may be true  for example a developer who purchases a property with a preservation deed restriction renounces his right to alter the property in certain ways however in most cases an historic property does not present with more limitations  and the ways in which these properties are limited are balanced by or even outweighed by their economic benefits as neil mayer professor of agricultural economics and rural sociology at the university of idaho writes the property rights of private owners are shared with the public sometimes these public interests conflict with the developers private business interests the key to working with historic properties as a private developer is learning to balance public and private interests a developer who is willing to sacrifice some of his property rights for the public good opens himself up to tremendous profits in historic redevelopment sustainable development and adaptive reuse private developers are faced with many options in their work demolition new construction and the redevelopment of older structures number among those myriad options arguably all of these options could be viable under the perfect conditions but the perfect conditions rarely exist in real life conditions development must be sustainable to succeed sustainability conserves resources and earns profits not just now but in the long run often demolition and new construction are less sustainable than the redevelopment of older structures therefore sustainable development and historic preservation go handinhand  one cannot exist without the other according to scholar angi fuller wildt at the university of south carolina the most environmentally sustainable buildings are those that are already built new construction and demolition are not only less green than the restoration of an old building but also frequently more expensive economic sustainability is just as much a part of sustainable development principles as environmental sustainability for example when a buildings original materials are maintained money is invested in local sources rather than overseas the maintenance of the buildings original character preservation of its materials provides another form of sustainability cultural sustainability the character of an area  its traditions its customs its way of life  is represented in the preserved history together environmental economic and cultural sustainability lay the foundation for sustainable development even if it is the most economically environmentally and culturally beneficial option conserving an historic building development is not without its own challenges for example an historic buildings original use may not align with its most sustainable future use which can present challenges with zoning or the towns allowed uses for the building an old mill might be zoned for industrial use only but a developer may see potential for a residential use in the future this is actually where adaptive reuse becomes most effective adaptive reuse allows the developer to refurbish an old structure for a purpose different from its original use 27 adaptive reuse zoning private developers can take many actions to make their job easier on the town likewise the town must also take action to make historic redevelopment easier on the developer in some towns zoning designations can hinder opportunities for the reuse of vacant or underutilized historic buildings  especially when the town is looking to attract a private developer adaptive reuse zoning lets the town government expand the allowed uses for the building by amending the existing zoning bylaw for example an empty mill building zoned for industrial use could be rezoned for commercial residential or mixed uses the bylaw should also contain site plan review or design guidelines to encourage developers to preserve the defining historical characteristic of the building the town planning board typically drafts adaptive reuse zoning bylaws before amending zoning bylaws the massachusetts historic commission recommends that the property is studied to determine its best uses then the most effective method of rezoning can be determined based on these uses at present maynard does not have an adaptive reuse zoning bylaw in order to pass an adaptive reuse zoning amendment the town planning board must hold a public hearing and issue a report to town meeting or city council only with a 23 majority vote in town meeting or city council can the amendment be passed therefore it is crucial for the local legislative body to garner community support for town preservation efforts prior to such a vote economic benefits of historic properties the reuse of historic properties can be economically prosperous in both the public and private sectors some of these benefits result merely from the practicality of historic redevelopment other times the public sector is willing to reward the developer with extra benefits as compensation for the property rights he or she has sacrificed for the greater good either way there are many opportunities for private developers to profit from their historic investments federal and state designations in most cases special designations awarded by the federal and state governments  such as the national and state registers of historic places  are only honorary meaning that they have no legal bearing over what happens to the building for private developers this is good news in the case of such a designation the historic status of the building does not interfere with the development process additionally these designations can provide economic benefits to private property owners studies have proven that historical designations  particularly in historic districts  increase residential property values over time by as much as 35% one reason for this is that historic designations can sometimes protect properties from fluctuations in the housing market this stability can attract more and more investors also causing an increase in property values 28 on the other hand newer construction in historic districts was shown to consistently depreciate in value making adaptive reuse a more viable method for development in these areas tax credits and easements tax credits are incentives provided by the government that can significantly reduce the amount of taxes a property owner must pay at the federal level both tax credits and easements otherwise known as preservation deed restrictions give private property owners the opportunity to return on their investments a 20% tax credit is available for incomeproducing historic properties and a 10% tax credit is available for properties built prior to 1936 property owners who donate an easement or preservation deed restriction to their property requiring all subsequent property owners to protect certain historic features of the building may also be eligible for a federal income tax deduction more information on federal tax credits can be found on  tourism in 201 the travel and tourism industries accounted for 31% of the us economy that same year the tourism industry generated over 105 million jobs as you can see the business of tourism can be a lucrative investment for a private developer heritage tourism  traveling to experience the history and culture of both past and present  is one part of that business one directly reliant on historic preservation even in small towns historic sites can be major draws for heritage tourists if those sites are not aptly preserved they lose much of their charm and allure  and the economy loses a substantial profit tourism can be not only profitable to the town but profitable to a private developer as well for example a refurbished farmhouse could make a successful private museum on the history of agriculture or an old jailhouse could be transformed into a novel restaurant  as is the case of the a&b burger joint in salem ma small business and downtown revitalization businesses unrelated to tourism may also find a suitable home in an historic building according to urban activist jane jacobs newer businesses  such as local boutiques and small startups  are more frequently attracted to the charm of older buildings than sleeker more modern designs privatelyowned businesses can profit from historic preservation even when their properties are not the ones in question in many small towns including maynard small businesses form the heart of the towns economy and culture the appearance of these businesses storefronts is one of the most important components of their advertising and marketing strategies some communities are finding that their downtown areas are suffering as their storefronts begin to deteriorate the rehabilitation of historic storefronts can draw more customers to these small downtown businesses however it is important to preserve the historic character of the 29 storefront in the revitalization process though a shiny modern exterior may hold superficial appeal many customers will also be attracted to the charm of an historic storefront many towns are passing bylaws  such as those enacting historic districts see pages 1617  to protect the historic character of their storefronts though private developers should undoubtedly be familiar with the nature of these bylaws they should not be intimidated by them ultimately when the community is happy with the developer the happiest customers will present here in maynard we are proud to invest ourselves in the future of our businesses downtown  and we recognize the substantial effect that the revitalization of storefronts can have on those businesses in maynard no organization better represents that interest than the revitalize maynard collaborative one of the most notable achievements of the organization is its commitment to rejuvenating storefronts downtown for example the organization sponsored a downtown spruce up prior to maynardfest where businesses spruced up their storefronts in celebration of the festivities partnering with the local government as previously stated private developers must often share their property rights with the public most of the time the public does not deal with the developer directly instead the government  representing the public interest  collaborates and compromises with the developer the more successful the collaboration between private and public interests the more successful the venture will be to the developer and the town this is especially true in cases of historic preservation as the public frequently harbors deep attachment and pride toward its history while it is crucial for private developers to honor that history the town should honor the developers goals for the property too when a developer succeeds in transforming an historic property into an incomeproducing business the town as well as the developer can reap the economic and cultural benefits publicprivate partnerships ppps a publicprivate partnership is the technical term for a collaboration between a private developer and the government in which private management is introduced into a public service publicprivate partnerships can comprise anything from a national park service contract with a private construction firm to the shared ownership of a building between the developer and the town government these partnerships are entered into via longterm contracts between the developer and the town the building does not necessarily need to be historic for a ppp to exist but for our purposes we will be focusing specifically on the implications of a ppp for an historic property known as heritage ppps ppps of any kind can be beneficial to both the public and private parties obviously the private developer serves a public interest simply by entering into the ppp however a developer can also provide fresh insight and creative innovation to bring that public interest to its fullest potential in some cases private investors also can provide the public with muchneeded capital  in other cases the public might fund the developers vision ppps can also be beneficial to developers because they allow the investor to share the risk of the venture with another entity 30 also significant is the influence that local governments have over public opinion public parties can help private developers gain local support for their projects in most heritage ppps the private developer partners with the local government the role of the local government or public partner is to regulate and protect the building while the private partner handles the economic side of the partnership and typically maintains longterm ownership and management of the property oftentimes a third partner  a nonprofit organization ngo  also enters the ppp but assumes only a passive role in the process sometimes the nonprofit may share ownership with the private partner  other times they may simply hold the local government accountable for its role in the sites preservation and help to influence public opinion regarding the ppp the ngo may also be able to provide historic expertise in a way that neither the public nor private parties can in most cases the building in question is one that is troublesome for the local government to maintain  the private developer helps to relieve some of the towns stress but in the meantime the preservation of the building is still ensured because of the gap between the cost of rehabilitating an historic building and the resulting value of the building the private developer frequently looks for the public partner to provide some type of funding since this funding can be daunting to provide several public institutions may enter into the ppp in this role though usually only the local government is considered the public partner of the developer usually the local government provides economic incentive in the form of tax credits or grants provisions for adaptive reuse see pages 2728 are another common component of a ppp by entering a longterm contract with the developer the public can be assured that the building will be preserved for at least one year or longer provisions are also made for the public partner in order to ensure the protection of the buildings historic character for example the ppp may stipulate maintenance requirements approvals for major changes the prohibition of demolition andor the reversion of ownership to the public at the end of the lease preservation deed restrictions see  may also be added onto the lease to ensure that these restrictions continue to apply to subsequent owners of the property the tremendous benefits of publicprivate partnerships should be shared with local citizens as long as both parties remain transparent and accountable with the public ppps can be a great way for a developer to make his profit while still ensuring the protection of an historic property alternatively ppps can lose public support when there is a lack of transparency and accountability on either side of the agreement 31 historic preservation for homeowners houses can be historic just as other buildings can while not all historic houses still serve a residential function many still do presenting a unique set of concerns for homeowners looking to preserve the historic character of their homes many of the resources available to public and private owners of historic properties  such as preservation consultant services see   are also useful to historic homeowners historic homeowners may also be subject to the conditions of preservation bylaws like historic districts just as private developers are nevertheless some resources and concerns are unique especially to historic homeowners in this section you will find information unique to historic homes  however historic homeowners are still recommended to consult the rest of this guide for other relevant information andor resources insurance if you have owned an historic home for some time now you are probably already familiar with the effects of your propertys history on insurance rates however if you have just bought or are considering buying an historic home you may be surprised to learn that typical insurance coverage might not cut it when it comes to your historic home the reason for this is quite simply age many historic homes have unique characteristics that must be preserved using period materials which can be more difficult andor more expensive than repairing a typical home historic properties are typically sorted into two categories those built before 1945 and those built before 1900 while owners of homes built before 1945 might consider a typical homeowner policy with some additional coverage owners of homes built before 1900 should definitely consider an historic home policy from a firm that specializes in historic homes that includes restoration coverage while this type of coverage can cost more in the long run the benefits far outweigh the costs for historic homes with unique architectural features likewise if you purchase a fixerupper historic home typical insurance coverage may do at first  however as you restore and upgrade the home its value will increase meaning that this policy may no longer apply therefore experts recommend that homeowners do an annual check of their insurance needs to make sure they are getting the coverage that works best for them the best way to determine how much insurance coverage your historic home needs is to obtain an insurance cost appraisal from an appraiser or a restoration contractor with extensive knowledge of historic properties after receiving an appraisal contact your insurance company and increase your buildings coverage limit to the appraised value insurance policies for historic homes should include replacementinkind coverage which will ensure the preservation of hardtoreplace details  such as handcrafted wood features decorative moldings or stained glass windows  in the event of damage or destruction this can be added onto a standard insurance policy but is typically included in policies specifically for historic homeowners when guaranteed replacement cost coverage is unavailable ask about extended replacement cost coverage  though it is a step down from guaranteed replacement 32 coverage it will add an extra layer of protection to your historic home if your historic home also includes expensive antiques or artwork you will also want to insure those items as most standard insurance policies only cover the market value of the home standard insurance policies also tend to include something called a coinsurance clause which is a warning sign for historic homeowners a coinsurance clause requires the policy holder to maintain a minimum insurance limit of around 8090% of the propertys value if you are underinsured this clause enables the insurance company to decrease your claim payment by the same percentage as you are underinsured this can result in the loss of important historic characteristics that may be particularly expensive to restore insuring an historic home can be pricey costing up to 20% more than standard insurance rates luckily there are a few precautions historic homeowners can take to lower these premiums installing modern safety tools such as smoke detectors sprinkler systems and burglar alarms can help lower your insurance rate without compromising the historic character of your home any restorations repairs or upgrades performed on your home should also comply with federal state and local building codes as previously stated modern repairs and upgrades can change your insurance policy by increasing the value of your home  however upgrading old plumbing and electrical systems can in some cases help convince firms to insure your historic home maintenance historic homes like other historic properties sometimes have a reputation for being expensive due to the substantial amount of upkeep that is sometimes needed to preserve the historic character of the property however regularly inspecting your historic home and performing the necessary maintenance can actually prevent the property from costing you more in the future as many costly problems are caused by a lack of proper routine maintenance a brief overview of the recommended inspection and maintenance procedures for historic homeowners adapted from preserve rhode island is provided below once a year  inspect the external wood features of your home sills cornices doors porch flooring etc for damage making sure to fill any cracks with a caulk or epoxy specifically designed for exterior use in addition to filling them unsealed joints should also be primed and painted with a good quality exterior paint if decayed wood is found it is important to locate and stop the source of moisture as soon as possible to prevent further damage which can quickly become costly and inconvenient  inspect all wooden railings and fences for deterioration rust moisture damage etc repair prime and paintstain them as necessary any metal fixtures other than those made from aluminum can be cleaned using a wire brush and primedpainted using paints made specifically for that metal aluminum should be cleaned with a mild detergent primed with zinc chromate and painted with paint designed for aluminum only alternatively bare aluminum can be protected using varnish or wax  inspect all structural systems including exposed exterior and interior surfaces of walls and all exposed roof framing members check for signs of movement andor deterioration in all walls both interior and exterior inspect roof supports for rotted 33 cracked or splitting timbers in the event that significant damage is discovered consult a structural engineer who is familiar with the nature of historic buildings engineers who are not familiar with historic buildings might recommend overlyaggressive solutions to structural problems  have a professional exterminator check for termites and other wooddamaging insects once a year treat appropriately if necessary twice a year  foundations and steps should not only be inspected in the fall and spring but also after any major storms proper drainage is the best form of prevention for any foundational problems however one should still check twice yearly for cracks or leaks water in the cellar is often a dead giveaway if a crack or leak is discovered consult a mason familiar with historic masonry and be sure to match the original mortar in color texture and composition in order to preserve its historic character also do not use any chemicals or other harsh methods such as sandblasting to clean your historic masonry  chimneys and fireplaces must be inspected for signs of crumbling loose or missing stones if damage is discovered consult a mason familiar with historic masonry and be sure to match the original mortar in color texture and composition  proper roof maintenance entails regular cleaning of the gutters andor downspouts and the replacement of deteriorating flashing additionally not only should the roof be inspected in the fall and spring but it should also be checked after any winds higher than 40 mph roof sheathing should be checked for proper ventilation and roof shingles should be checked for any worn or missing components also check the nails and clips to make sure that all components of the roof are properly secured and no water can leak loose attachments should be repaired immediately while plywood rolled asphalt roofing or tar paper can provide a temporary solution for more serious damage  appropriate surface cleaning techniques should be used on all window frames including but not limited to rust removal limited paint removal and reapplication of protective coatings making windows weathertight may also be effective to reduce damage and increase thermal efficiency  this can be done either be recaulking or installing weatherstripping treating the window frames with a  mixture of linseed oil and mineral spirits prior to repair can help extend the life of the wood for windows it is also especially important to limit any replacements made to the original window frames repair is a more viable option for historic preservation  however selective replacements may be made to the frames when necessary  the preservation of the exterior wood features of your home is especially important because it is a huge part of what gives it its historic character proper drainage is the best way to prevent wood damage also avoid powerwashing as it can allow water to seep in unnoticed if repainting of the exterior wood is ever necessary avoid stripping paint layers as these layers help protect the wood from water and uv damage all new work to the exterior wood features of the building should be done inkind using the same materials techniques dimensions and configuration as in the original design three or more times per year 34  check gutters and downspouts frequently including after any storms or high winds leaks should be repaired clogs should be cleaned and loose guttersdownspouts should be properly reattached to protect the foundation of your home from water damage consider installing a downspout leader or tray andor wood gutters which have superior tensile strength also install any downspout replacements with the seams facing away from the wall to avoid leaks from damaging the sidewall features of the building  paint should be inspected on a regular basis for bare spots blistering peeling and mildew stopping leaks as quickly as possible helps to prevent mildew but if you still discover mildewed areas of your home these areas can be cleansed with a mixture of 1 part bleach to 10 parts water any paint or primer used on your home should be compatible with the materials and any preservatives used on the material going green in an historic home news of climate change has rocked the nation for decades now leading many homeowners to become more energy efficient or go green luckily many historic homes were originally built with energysaving features such as thick walls lightreflecting finishes vents and shadeproviding awnings andor porches maximizing the energysaving potential of these preexisting features is a costeffective way to go green in an historic home for example in the northeast saltboxstyle homes were designed with sloped roofs to direct cold winds up and over the house keeping it warmer in wintertime chimneys were placed in the center of the house to allow heat to radiate outward and houses and outbuildings were typically grouped in l or ushapes to create a sheltered area in which to work thick masonry walls also help keep the house warm during the day and cool at night by absorbing the suns rays during the day these classicallyhistoric features can reduce the need for heating systems in the winter and cooling systems in the summer providing great potential for energy efficiency even in the modern era besides their original energysaving designs historic homes can also be made more energy efficient changes andor upgrades the national trust for historic preservation recommends starting with a professional energy audit  or performing your own  to identify a baseline for your homes energy efficiency after that you are ready to begin going green reducing air infiltration is one of the easiest most effective ways to improve your energy efficiency cracks in attic floors and doors among other openings allow conditioned air to leak outside increasing the cost of cooling certain problems  such as wet or moldy insulation a history of ice dams in the winter andor knob and tube wiring  may require a professional contractor to fix however attic air leaks can often be sealed oneself using a combination of fiberglass insulation foil insulation or drywall and caulk drafts can also be reduced significantly by taking simple measures such as closing curtains or shades at night using rolled towels or draft snakes at the bottoms of doors and closing fireplace dampers when not in use heating and cooling systems can sap energy when used inefficiently before replacing your hvac system  a costly upgrade which in an historic home could also increase your insurance premiums address any problems with your air infiltration you can also take simple 35 doityourself measures to reduce your heating and cooling bills for example the hot water system  which accounts for about 13% of the energy bill in most homes  can be used more efficiently by insulating the pipes and turning the thermostat down to 120 degrees fahrenheit you might also consider installing a tankless hot water system or solarpowered hot water system without significantly impacting altering the historic character of your home geothermal heat pumps can also be more energy efficient  however if your historic property is also part of an historic landscape your property may need to be evaluated for archaeological resources before geothermal pumps can be installed finally retrofitting windows  rather than replacing them with newer more energyefficient windows  is a cheaper more viable option to increase the energy efficiency of historic homes as it allows the owner to preserve the original historic windows if they are intact according to the national trust for historic preservations green lab the rate of return for retrofitted windows amounted to 34% nearly double that of installing modern energyefficient windows retrofitting strategies include weather stripping and sealing and installing exterior storm windows or interior cellular shades what option you choose should depend on the climate in which you live and the other needs of your home  in other words make sure you are prepared for the next harsh new england winter national trust for historic preservation programs in addition to funding and

success stories though historic preservation sometimes seems exclusive to national parks and museums we can witness preservation in our own backyard from national register sites to community preservation projects maynard is home to many exemplars of historic preservation a sampling of maynards past preservation projects appears below to help inspire and provide guidelines for future preservation glenwood cemetery glenwood cemetery has existed in maynard ma since the towns formation in the early 1870s it contains more than 6000 gravesites including those of 54 civil war veterans many famous locals including town founder amory maynard were buried there and its monuments are excellent representations of the artistic and architectural styles of the time perhaps most importantly the cemetery represents the diverse cast of immigrants who populated maynard at the time including names of english scottish irish russian polish finnish swedish and greek descent interestingly enough research also suggests a moderate to high potential of locating native american and other archaeological artifacts and resources in the area as a result glenwood cemetery received recognition from the national park service as a national register property on  to this day the cemetery remains the only historic site in maynard to receive a national register designation in 201 the maynard historical commission embarked on a cpafunded project to repair the fence surrounding glenwood cemetery the fence gradually damaged by many new england winters was deemed too ramshackle to restore so replacing the fence became the focus of the project instead the annual town meeting allocated community preservation act and perpetual care funds toward the project which has been executed as a group effort of the historical commission maynard department of public works and masscor industries the maynard mill the maynard mill originally owned and operated by town founder amory maynard and his partner william knight has remained the heart of maynards cultural and commercial life despite numerous changes in ownership and use the mill which opened in 184 and its prospects of work attracted a sprawling and diverse population of immigrants to the town ten years later the mill closed in a nationwide recession the only original mill building still standing today has been moved across the street and adaptively reused as an apartment house during the civil war the mill reopened under the leadership of the american woolen company cranking out woolen textiles for use by the union army its success and the influx of immigrant work were so overwhelming that the mill managed to stay in business until the great depression when the national financial crisis forced it to sell all of its housing 47 the mill reopened again during world wars i and ii to produce blankets and jackets for american soldiers however when peace resumed business once again dwindled due to the outsourcing of factory jobs overseas and the increased use of synthetic fibers luckily in 185 two young engineers from mits lincoln laboratory secured space in the mill complex for their startup digital equipment corporation dec dec like so many of the mills prior endeavors evolved into a tremendous success growing to become the second largest employer in the state of massachusetts second only to the commonwealth itself in 197 dec was acquired by compac which maintained offices in the mill complex until 1998 after the absence of dec the mill complex was first reused for commercial use as clock tower place in the early 2000s ushering in a new era of business triumphs and trials for the town of maynard in march of 201 clock tower place was acquired by saracen properties a private developer with big plans for the future of the mill built in 1847 reborn in 2016 11 million square feet of pure potential these are just a few of the slogans for saracen properties planned revitalization of the maynard mill and former clock tower place each of which captures both the historic essence and the bright future of the property the company has rechristened the complex mill and main and is currently redesigning it for mixed uses its amenities will include groundfloor retail a riverside boardwalk and a brandnew brew pub operated by battle road brewing which opened in august 2015 saracens creative transformation and expansion of the mills preexisting resources makes mill and main a prime example of adaptive reuse artspace and acme theater on  the town of maynard voted to erect an eightroom schoolhouse on summer street emerson junior high school  built by the tp hurley construction company of marlborough mass  officially opened for use two years later on  the addition of the george washington auditorium would join this school with the former high school leading the complex to be renamed the emersonfowler school the name was later shortened to the fowler junior high and eventually the fowler middle school when construction on a new fowler middle school began the question of what to do with the old one loomed over every head in town in 199 the town voted to appoint a fowler school building reuse committee as all these changes were happening a local group of artists  informally called the assabet river artists association araa  assembled creating an impetus for the transformation of the school into art studios perfectly enough the reuse committee concluded in 1999 that the most suitable use for the building was lease to a nonprofit cultural or arts group the building was officially transferred to artspace inc in january of 2001 studios remain in high demand as 43 studios are shared between 75 artists and only one or two spaces become available each year meanwhile acme theater productions  a community theatre troupe shares artspaces residency in the old fowler though the group formed in 199 acme theater did not officially become a nonprofit corporation until 200 conveniently as the reused school began to seek occupants a few minor injuries later the fowlers old wood shop was converted by hand into a 70seat theater 48 together artspace and acme theater form the cultural center of maynard not only is the complex at the old fowler school a perfect example of adaptive reuse  it is also a living breathing thriving work of art in and of itself coolidge school the coolidge school was one of several elementary schools built in the early 1900s to account for the growing population of mill workers and their children the lower level of the coolidge school was built in 190 while the second level was added in 1910 however the school is considered historic rather than simply old due to its ties to maynardian james mullin who contracted the original first story and the master architect charles bateman widely known for his commissions throughout the boston area due to this rich history the building was declared eligible for the national register of historic properties in 199 though this designation was not pursued additionally the school is home to an enormous hill famous for its wintertime revelry and a renovated public playground for entertainment during warmer months in 201 the maynard school administration who previously held office in the building announced its intentions to vacate the coolidge school the other tenants including the maynard food pantry and hudsonmaynard adult learning center soon followed suit rendering the future of the building uncertain to tackle the enormous problem of preserving the coolidge schools history the maynard historical commission and board of selectmen worked together to form the coolidge school reuse taskforce committee to make recommendations for the empty buildings possible fate and eventual uses the committee orchestrated a public forum to garner public opinion on the future of the coolidge school while some wondered if the high costs of rehabilitation caused largely by a lack of routine maintenance throughout the years would be unappealing to private developers many believed the costs of losing the building would be much greater than the costs of preservation 56% of attendees believed that preserving the school was of the utmost importance and 50% felt it was important that the school remained in public use yet 79% did not care whether the building was publicly or privately owned eventually the committee submitted its recommendations to the board of selectmen it determined that the school would best be adaptively reused rather than demolished and that the town should invest in repairs to prevent future deterioration while the ownership of the building was debated among the recommended preservation strategies were a request for proposals rfp from private developers the imposition of a preservation deed restriction and the subdivision of the lots to keep the schools playground in public use as of now the building remains in limbo but the coolidge school can ultimately be considered a preservation success due to the overwhelming public support in favor of maintaining its historic character maynard public library many maynard residents likely remember the conversion of the old roosevelt school at 77 nason street into the current home of the maynard public library the final result of this rehabilitation project was unveiled on  49 a lot happened prior to the librarys grand reopening before anything else the roosevelt school had to be built in 191 a vote of 147 to 2 decided that the town would build a 14room elementary school for $55000 the school opened for classes in the fall of 191 although its start date was delayed due to the ongoing influenza epidemic rehabilitating the damaged school was no small  or cheap  feat according to the librarys website the estimated costs totaled an impressive $57 million amassing this sum required a combination of state local and private funding $21 million came from a library construction grant from the massachusetts board of library commissioners while the remaining $36 was borrowed thanks to a debtexclusion matter passed at the may 2003 town meeting meanwhile the cost to taxpayers was defrayed capital campaign conducted by the friends of the maynard public library which managed to raise over $500000 in pledges and donations the tremendous achievement of the roosevelt schools rehabilitation stands as a paragon of historic preservation in maynard only time will tell if the present challenges of the coolidge school mill and main and our other reused properties will meet similarly successful fates 50 bibliography a brief history of the national trust national trust for historic preservation international national trusts organization nd web 30 apr
