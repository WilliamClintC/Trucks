that will reduce the consumption of water reduce the loss or waste of water improve the efficiency in the use of water or increase the recycling and reuse of water so that a water supply is made available for future or alternative uses b objective based upon these concepts of water conservation stephenvilles objective is to develop a water conservation plan that increases water use efficiency thereby reducing water demands without adversely affecting population and the economic growth potential of its customers tex water 23a b  am passed 8262003  am passed 252008 goals a 1 the objective of stephenvilles water conservation plan is to promote and publicize water conservation methods that will enable stephenville to meet its goal of reducing the 20092013 fiveyear average annual per capita water use of 104 gallons per person per day gpcd by approximately one and one half percent or 156 gpcd to 1024 gpcd by 201 and by three percent to 1009 gpcd by 2024 2 this municipal per capita water use statistic includes water used within the home for drinking toilet flushing bathing food preparation dishwashing laundry cleaning and outdoor uses at home including landscape irrigation car washing and outside cleaning in addition to the water used at homes the municipal per capita water use statistic includes a persons share of water used in the workplace for toilet flushing drinking cleaning and lawn irrigation of commercial properties outside the home uses also include the water used in commercial establishments such as restaurants laundries and car washes institutional water use such as water used in schools churches recreation centers and water used by cities for fire protection sanitation and public recreation is also included in the municipal per capita water use statistic however the municipal per capita water use statistic does not include use of any water for industrial purposes the annual per capita water use statistic includes the municipal per capita water use as well as

development concept that encourages residents to adopt lowwaterusing landscaping principles and methods for use around the home the same concepts can be applied to other landscaped areas as well including parks and other public places b one popular method of reducing water use for landscape irrigation is to encourage residents to use xeriscaping techniques for landscaping there are seven generally adopted principles when planning a xeriscaped yard 1 planning and design during this step an appropriate plan is developed considering such variables as climate existing vegetation intended use of the space and topographic features 2 soil analysis examine the soil types covering the whole site 3 appropriate plant selection plants should be selected which are native to the area or are adaptive to the site 4 practical turf areas plan where turf areas should be located and consider increasing the area of decks porous paving paths and mulched planting beds to reduce turf 5 efficient irrigation landscaped areas should only be watered as needed and then usually during the early morning or late evening to avoid water lost due to evaporation keeping in mind some plant species may experience mold andor fungus growth if watered at night 6 use of mulches a three to fourinch layer of mulch should cover all exposed soil areas and be replenished twice a year 7 appropriate maintenance keep the yard well maintained to reduce the use of fertilizer chemicals and water passed 8262003  am passed 252008 additional conservation strategies the city will select any combination of the following strategies in addition to those strategies listed above if they are necessary to achieve the stated water conservation goals of this water conservation plan the tceq may also require

technical potential for reducing per capita water use is the range in potential water savings that can be achieved by implementing specific water conservation measures the bottom of the range represents the potential savings under an advanced conservation scenario the conservation measures include reducing unaccountedfor water uses  reducing indoor water use due to waterconserving plumbing fixtures  reducing seasonal water use  and reducing water use education programs guidelines for calculating the technical potential water savings for each of these conservation measures are given below 1 reducing unaccountedfor water uses the tceq formerly tnrcc considers unaccountedfor water uses of 15 percent or less acceptable for communities serving more than 5000 people smaller older systems that have a larger service area may legitimately experience larger losses losses above 15 percent may be an area of concern and provide a conservation potential 2 reducing indoor water use due to waterconserving plumbing fixtures the tceq uses 205 gpcpd as the most reliable figure upon which to base potential water savings which represents the most likely conservation scenario this figure is based upon the estimate that by 205 90 percent of pre1990 homes and all new homes will have been equipped with water conserving plumbing fixtures the figures used for the advanced conservation scenario 217 gpcpd is an estimate of the average savings that would result from a home equipped exclusively with water conserving plumbing fixtures this figure is considered advanced because in a typical city 100 percent of the homes are not exclusively equipped with waterconserving fixtures 3 reducing seasonal water use the texas water development board twdb has calculated seasonal use as a percentage of average annual per capita use for east texas 20 percent west texas 25 percent and state wide average of 225 percent seasonal water use is calculated by multiplying the average annual per capita use in gpcpd by the appropriate percentage the technical potential for reduction in seasonal use is then calculated by multiplying the seasonal use by seven percent for the most likely conservation scenario and by 20 percent for the advanced scenario 4 reducing water use education programs the technical potential for water conservation from public education programs is estimated to be from two percent of the average annual per capita use for the most likely conservation scenario to five percent for the advanced scenario according to the water conservation handbook published in

context of where signs are to be placed on any given facade  6 type of illumination proposed and whether external or internal  7 landscaping or ornamental structures including fences fountains public art ground cover and other landscaping elements that are intended to complement the proposed sign palette and design  and 8 any other information as required by the decisionmaking bodies b design guidelines 1 the sign design guidelines are designed to help ensure quality signs that communicate their message in a clear fashion  however the guidelines are not as strict as sign standards the building official may interpret the design guidelines with some flexibility in their application to specific signsprojects as not all design criteria may be workable or appropriate for each sign or project in some circumstances one guideline may be relaxed to facilitate compliance with another guideline determined by the review authority to be more important in the particular case the overall objective is to ensure that the intent and spirit of the design guidelines are followed a compatibility with surroundings 1 proportional size and scale the scale of signs should be based on the building facade on which they are placed and the area in which they are located the size and shape of a sign should be proportional with the scale of the structure large storefronts such as big boxes will be allowed to have proportionally larger signs than smaller storefronts signs should not overwhelm the section of the building facade on which it is placed upon 2 integrate signs with the building signs should be designed so that they are integrated with the design of the building a well designed building facade or storefront is created by the careful coordination of sign and architectural design and a coordinated color scheme signs in multipletenant buildings should be designed to complement or enhance the other signs in the building sign placement and design should be reviewed within the context of building design 3 corporate franchise signage corporate franchise signage should conform to the communitys visual desires while maintaining some elements of corporate identity corporate logos should fit the context color scale and building elements b location and mounting 1 signs should be mounted in locations that respect the design of a building and site including the arrangement of bays and openings signs should not obscure windows including secondstory windows window trimmolding grillwork piers pilasters and other ornamental features 2 attached signs on fascias above storefront windows should be sized to fit within existing friezes lintels spandrels and other such features and not extend above below or beyond them typically attached signs should be centered on horizontal surfaces eg over a storefront opening 3 when a large building contains several storefronts signs for the individual businesses should relate well to each other in terms of locations height proportion color and illumination maintaining continuity will reinforce the buildings facade composition while still retaining each businesss identity c color 1 avoid using too many colors colors or color combinations that interfere with legibility of the sign copy or that interfere with viewer identification of other signs should be avoided 2 use contrasting colors contrast is an important influence on the legibility of signs a substantial contrast should be provided between the color and material of the background and the letters or symbols to make the sign easier to read in both day and night light letters on a dark background or dark letters on a light background are most legible light letters on a dark background work best for both day and night time use d materials 1 compatibility of materials sign materials should be compatible with the design of the facade on which they are placed consider the architectural design of the buildings facade and select materials that complement the design the selected materials should also contribute to the legibility of the sign for example glossy finishes are often difficult to read because of glare and reflections 2 appropriate materials sign materials should be extremely durable paper and cloth signs are not suitable for exterior use except on awnings because they deteriorate quickly if wood is used it should be properly sealed to keep moisture from soaking into the wood and causing the signs lettering to deteriorate e sign legibility 1 concise name identification a concise name or limited lines of copy should be used whenever possible given the limited amount of time the vehicle traveling public has to identify and read the sign the fewer number of words the more effective the sign a simple and succinct sign is easier to read and looks more attractive because it is less cluttered 2 use symbols and logos symbols and logos can be used in place of words whenever appropriate pictographic images will usually register more quickly in the viewers mind than a written message and they can be an expression of the owners creativity 3 limit the number of letter styles the number of lettering styles that are used on a sign should be limited in order to increase legibility as a general rule limit the number of different letter types to no more than two for small signs and three for larger signs intricate typefaces and symbols that are difficult to read reduce the signs ability to communicate f sign illumination 1 internal illumination individually illuminated letters either internally illuminated or backlit solid letters reverse channel are a preferred alternative to internally illuminated plastic cabinet signs signs comprised of individual letters mounted directly on a structure can often use a distinctive element of the structures facade as a backdrop thereby providing a better integration of the sign with the structure 2 use a projected light source signs along roadways with slower moving traffic or in pedestrianoriented environment should consider illumination by a projected light source eg spotlight projection lighting is usually a better alternative because the sign will appear to be integrated with the buildings architecture light fixtures supported in front of the sign cast light on the sign and generally a portion of the buildings face as well projected lighting emphasizes the continuity of the structures surface and signs become an integral part of the facade the use of small unobtrusive fixtures for external projection lighting is encouraged avoid the use of oversized fixtures that are out of scale with the sign and structure whenever projection lighting is used fluorescent or incandescent care should be taken to properly shield the light source to prevent glare from spilling over into residential areas and any public rightofway signs should be lighted only to the minimum level required for nighttime readability 3 cabinet signs the use of internally illuminated cabinet signs is discouraged when such signs are proposed the background field is required to be opaque so that only the lettering appears illuminated eg routed or pushgraphics when the background is not opaque the entire sign face becomes bright and the sign becomes visually separated from the building as a result this type of sign can disrupt the continuity of the facade 4 electrical raceways and conduits electrical transformer boxes and raceways are required to be concealed from public view if a raceway cannot be mounted internally behind the finished exterior wall the exposed metal surfaces of the raceway should be finished to match the background wall or integrated into the overall design of the sign if raceways are necessary they should be as thin and narrow as possible and should never extend in width or height beyond the area of the signs lettering or graphics all exposed conduit and junction boxes should also be concealed from public view 5 neon signs neonled or similar types of lighting are discouraged 1273 restricted or incidental parking signs a location 1 can be affixed to a pole at the curb 2 can be vertically mounted
