under the entry for each ordinance the catchlines of all sections appear in lowercase indented and alphabetized cross references and additional entries are provided where necessary to direct the user to a particular topic in preparing the index the proper balance has been achieved between creating an index comprehensive enough to be useful and yet not so detailed that it requires extensive revision each time an ordinance is enacted repealed or amended looseleaf supplements since an ordinance compilation unlike a bound book is constantly in a state of evolution a special feature of this compilation is the looseleaf system of binding with this system the compilation can easily be kept uptodate by submitting copies of new ordinances or amendments as they are enacted these will then be incorporated by the editor into the compilation and the appropriate pages will be revised or created for distribution to the holders of copies with specific instructions for the manner of removing obsolete pages and inserting the current ones through regular supplementation the compilation will continue to remain current and useful listing of ordinances village  subject location 1001 village
