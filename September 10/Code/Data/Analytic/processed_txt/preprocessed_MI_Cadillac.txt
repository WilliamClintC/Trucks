providing the service at the levels demanded by the users prior ch 22   findings a potable water the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the businesses industries governmental and charitable agencies and residents located in the city need to have potable and otherwise usable water b availability the city further has previously found and currently reaffirms that the supply of potable water available from private wells within the city is insufficient to assure that all businesses industries governmental and charitable agencies and residents will have sufficient potable water available for their use and other water necessary for industrial and fire prevention and control unless the city offers water to all properties located within the city c method of measuring use based on advice of its engineers the city has previously found and currently affirms that the most precise method of measuring for use of the water supply system by any user is by a meter or meters installed and controlled by the city d continuation of service the city has previously found and further currently reaffirms that in order to provide and continue to provide clean potable and other usable water to all users of the water supply system in quantities necessary for all varieties of use it is necessary from time to time to install improvements enlargements extensions and repairs to the system e purpose of charges charges for the use of water supply system are hereby established for the purpose of recovering the cost of construction reconstruction

the cost of serving those users f proportionality fairness and benefits of charges rates and fees the city has previously found and further currently reaffirms that the fairest and most reasonable method of providing for the operation maintenance repair replacement and improvement of the water supply system is to charge each user 1 based in all cases on amount of use for a the cost of retiring debt secured by the net revenues of the system issued to pay for improvements and replacements to the water supply system  b the costs of ongoing repair replacement and improvement and budgeted as part of the annual costs of the system  and c operation administration and maintenance costs of the system 2 the city has investigated several methods of apportioning the costs of the water supply system based on its investigation and on the advice of its engineers the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that to ensure the stability and viability of the system for the benefit of its users the fairest and most accurate way to apportion the costs of operation maintenance replacement and improvement of the system is to charge each user a a monthly fixed charge for water service which varies depending on the size of the water intake pipe and meter which fee re flects users proportionate share of the fixed costs of the system  and b a commodity charge for water usage which is based on the users actual use of water supplied by the system 3 the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the charges rates and fees set forth herein fairly and accurately apportion the fixed and variable costs of the water supply system among the users of the system and that the monthly service charge and commodity charges for water service charged to each user of the water supply system provide actual benefits to such users in the form of ready access to water services that would be unavailable if such charges were not charged the city council has previously found that the benefit charge as provided in section 42200 represents a fair and accurate method for apportioning the cost of mains to persons who connect to the water supply system subsequent to construction and further is equal to the benefit conferred upon such persons the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the charges for private fire protection customer service public fire protection and service to nonresidents as provided in sections 42202 represent fair and accurate charges necessary to make such services available and that such charges are equal to the actual benefit conferred upon such users g useful life of improvements based on the advice of its engineers the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that any improvements to or capital expenditures for the water supply system did not at the time such improvements were constructed and financed have an expected useful or design life that would exceed the term of the respective bonds issued to finance such improvements or capital expenditures and paid for by rates and charges h charges rates and fees for nonresidents the city has previously found and hereby ratifies and confirms that the total direct and indirect costs of providing service to users outside the city jurisdiction where no other contract exists with the governmental units where those users are located equals at least two times the rates and charges imposed on users located in the city indirect costs include payment for capital improvements extraordinary repairs and replacements for the water supply system benefiting all users of the system and paid for by users served within the corporate limits of the city or the corporate limits of other municipalities which have entered

division 1  generally findings and purpose a necessity the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the use of septic tanks privies privy vaults cesspools or similar private sewage disposal facilities is deleterious to the health safety and welfare of the businesses industries governmental and charitable agencies and residents of the city and that the health safety and welfare of the businesses industries governmental and charitable agencies and residents is enhanced by the creation of a public sewer system and treatment plant with regulation by the city of pollutants and other harmful materials according to state and federal standards b method of measuring use based on advice of its engineers the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the most practical cost effective and accurate method given available technology of measuring the use of the systems sewers and treatment plant by any user is by the meter or meters used to measure water usage c continuation of service the city has previously found and further currently reaffirms that in order to provide and continue to provide for the safe and uninterrupted removal and treatment of sewage pollutants and other harmful materials it is necessary from time to time to install improvements enlargements extensions and repairs to the sewage disposal system d purpose of charges charges for the use of the system are hereby established for the purpose of recovering the cost of construction reconstruction maintenance repair and operation of the sewage disposal system such charges shall be made in accordance with the provisions hereinafter set forth and shall be made against all users of the sewage disposal system 1 all premises connected directly or indirectly to the sewage disposal system except as hereinafter provided shall be charged and shall make payments to the city in amounts computed on the basis of this article 2 the charges rates and fees for service by the sewage disposal system are established herein to adequately provide for bond requirements and to ensure that the system shall not operate at a deficit 3 the city staff or designated parties shall periodically review the charges rates fees rules and regulations of the sewage disposal system said review shall be completed not less than one time per fiscal year results of said review shall be reported to the city council with respective recommendations for any adjustments 4 the charges rates and fees shall be set so as to recover costs from users in reasonable proportion to the cost of serving those users e proportionality fairness and benefits of charges rates and fees 1 the city has previously found and further currently reaffirms that the fairest and most reasonable method of providing for the operation maintenance repair replacement and improvement of the sewage disposal system is to charge each user based in all cases on amount of use for the a cost of retiring debt secured by the net revenues of the system issued to pay for improvements and replacements to the system  b costs of ongoing repair replacement and improvement and budgeted as part of the annual costs of the system  and c operation administration and maintenance costs of the system 2 the city has investigated several methods of apportioning the cost of the system based on its investigation and on the advice of its engineers the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that to ensure the stability and viability of the system for the benefit of its users the fairest and most accurate way to apportion the costs of operation maintenance replacement and improvement of the system is to charge each user a a monthly service charge for sewer service which varies depending on the size of the water intake pipe and meter which fee reflects each users proportionate share of the costs of the system  b a commodity charge for sewer service which is based on the users actual use of water supplied by the system or in the case of users whose water service is unmetered a flat monthly fee based upon the number of rooms of such user 3 the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the charges rates and fees set forth herein fairly and accurately apportion the fixed and variable costs of the system among the users of the system and that the monthly service charge for sewer service charged to each user of the system provides actual benefits to such users in the form of ready access to sewer services that would be unavailable if the monthly service charge was not charged f useful life of improvements based on the advice of its engineers the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that any improvements to or capital expenditures by the system did not at the time of such construction and financing have an expected useful or design life that would exceed the term of the bonded indebtedness issued to finance such improvement or capital acquisition and paid for by rates and charges g charges rates and fees for nonresidents the city has previously found and hereby ratifies and confirms that the total direct and indirect costs of providing service to users outside the city jurisdiction where no other contract exists with the governmental units where those users are located equals at least two times the rates and charges imposed for direct services and debt service cost to users located in the city indirect costs include payment for capital improvements extraordinary repairs and replacements for the system benefiting all users of the system and paid for by users served within the corporate limits of the city or the corporate limits of other municipalities which have entered into contracts with the city

threats to the treatment plant inclusion of toxic hazardous or other undesirable constituents additionally to provide the degree of control necessary to properly screen and monitor these wastes would require extensive preliminary sampling and lab analysis review of load manifests and trip tickets and a complete recordkeeping system lastly once wastes are accepted into the system they and any environmental problems they may cause become the responsibility of the sewage disposal system b requests have come from septage haulers public institutions private industrial waste haulers and private

chapter is derived although such use of land or structure may not conform with the provisions of this chapter it is recognized however that those nonconformities which adversely affect orderly development and the value of nearby property are not permitted to continue without restriction b encourage appropriate groupings the zoning regulations established by this chapter are designed to guide the future use of land in the city by encouraging appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses and thus to promote and protect the public health safety and general welfare the continued existence of nonconformities is frequently inconsistent with the purposes for which such regulations are established and thus their gradual elimination is generally desirable the regulations of this section permit such nonconformities to continue without specific limitation of time but are generally intended to restrict further investments which would make them more permanent c distinction between major nonconforming uses or structures and minor nonconformities different regulations are established for each of these categories in this subsection the degree of restriction over each category is a function of the degree to which that category of nonconformity is a nuisance or incompatible with the purposes and regulations of this chapter 1 major nonconforming use or structure a a

other visual outdoor advertising are necessary to the commerce health safety and general welfare of the residents of the city further it finds that failure to regulate their size location and construction may lead to poor identification of individual businesses deterioration of the business and residential areas of the city intensification of the conflicts between different types of land use reduction in the effectiveness of traffic control devices and safety hazards to pedestrians and motorists further it finds that the citys economic base is dependent on preserving property values and a healthy business climate b purpose the purpose of this section is to regulate signs and outdoor advertising in a manner which will minimize the harmful effects while permitting latitude for
