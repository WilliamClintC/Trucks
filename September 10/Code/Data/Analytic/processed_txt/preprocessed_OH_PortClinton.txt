comparative tables of special ordinances codified ordinances of port clinton ohio  part one  administrative three  traffic five  general offenses seven  business regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen building fifteen  fire prevention s note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the

same side the vessel which is to windward shall keep out of the way of the vessel which is to leeward 3 if a vessel with the wind on the port side sees a vessel to windward and cannot determine with

vessel is in any doubt as to whether it is overtaking another it shall assume that this is the case and act accordingly d any subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall not

action to avoid collision by its maneuver alone as soon as it becomes apparent to it that the vessel required to keep out of the way is not taking appropriate action in compliance with this chapter b when from any cause the vessel required to keep its course and speed finds itself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of the giveway vessel alone it shall take such action as will best aid to avoid collision c a powerdriven vessel which takes action in a crossing situation in accordance with subsection a 2 hereof to avoid collision with another powerdriven vessel shall if the circumstances of the case admit not alter course to port for a vessel on its own port side d this rule does not relieve the giveway vessel of its obligation to keep out of the way no person shall

radar alone the presence of another vessel shall determine if a closequarters situation is developing or risk of collision exists if so it shall take avoiding action in ample time provided that when such action consists of an alteration of course so far as possible the following shall be avoided an alteration of course to port for a vessel forward of the beam other than for a vessel being overtaken and an alteration of course toward a vessel abeam or abaft the beam e except where it has been determined that a risk of collision does not exist every vessel which hears apparently forward of its beam the fog signal of another vessel or which cannot avoid a closequarters situation with another vessel forward of its beam shall reduce its speed to the minimum at which it can be kept on

impose strict liability for an offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability c1when language defining an element of an offense that is related to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
