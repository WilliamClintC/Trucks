hamilton county engineer these quantities of materials are expected to yield approximately 1 cubic yard of mixture of a flowable consistency the proportioning of materials shall be the responsibility of the contractor adjustments of the proportions shall be based on maintaining the total absolute volume and proportioning shall insure that unconfined compressive strength at 90 days does not exceed 150 psi 108 tsf the minimum unconfined compressive strength shall not be less than 50 psi 36 t sf the contractor may be required to provide test data from a laboratory or testing firm such laboratory or firm to be approved by the hamilton county engineer demonstrating that the proposed proportioning will meet the strength limitations listed above emix adjustments  to expedite consolidation of type i or type ii mixtures as defined in above it will be necessary for bleed water to appear on the surface immediately after the mixture is struck off a delay in bleeding is an indication of too many fines in the mixture in this case the fly ash quantity shall be reduced in increments of 50 lbs until the mixture is bleeding freely approximately 60 lbs of sand shall be added to replace each 50 lbs increment of fly ash in order to maintain yield to produce a flowable mix it may be necessary to produce one or more one cubic yard trial batches at different water contents the mixture shall be considered too dry if cracks develop in the mixture as it flows into place fflow test  a test for proper flow consists of filling a 3 inch diameter by 6 inch high open ended cylinder placed on a smooth nonporous level surface to the top struck level with flowable mixture within 5 seconds of fillingstriking the cylinder shall be pulled straight up the resulting spread material shall have a diameter of at least 8 inches except for types iv and v gpumping  the mixes proportioned by types i and ii may not be pumpable if the contractor elects to pump the flowable mixture fly ash may be added up to a maximum content of 750 lbs fine aggregates shall be reduced to maintain absolute volume of themixture hfcdf  fast setting type iv and v  the initial mixture shall be as specified in above fast setting mixture may be used elsewhere but shall be used as directed by the hamilton county engineer for backfilling trenches under pavement within the public rightofway when it is deemed that the pavement must be quickly reopened to traffic so as to minimize inconvenience to vehicular traffic or as shown on the plans the use of fcdf fast setting mixture is intended to allow for placement of an asphaltic concrete pavement within four hours after mixture placement fcdf fast setting mixture shall meet the compressive strength requirements as included in above imixing equipment

northeast corner of glendale milford road and reading road in addition west of interstate 75 a mix of a few singlefamily dwellings large churchschool areas and a commercial industrial area exists 2the major traffic arteries within the village consist of an interstate highway i75 running north and south completely village two major eastwest streets cooper and glendalemilford roads taking a somewhat parallel course about a mile apart and us route 42 reading road running parallel to i75 dividing the eastern residential area from the commercialindustrial valley area 3externally a circle freeway i275 runs eastwest about three miles north of the village an interstate highway i71 lies about three miles to the east of the village and the uncompleted cross county highway parallels i275 three miles to the south it is anticipated that upon completion of the cross county highway glendalemilford will no longer be designated as a state route 4the topography of the village is such that the commercial industrial areas are in the mill creek valley and the residential areas arc located in the highlands in the eastern and western areas of the village 5the economy of the village is such that there are approximately ten times the number of people working in the village as living in it the tax base of the village is dominated by one of the largest employers in the greater cincinnati metropolitan area with a number of small businesses providing support to this employer in addition there is a concentration of truck oriented businesses along evendale drive which runs parallel to i75

are undeveloped or underdeveloped 2channelization of the millcreek is incomplete especific successes of the land use of the village 1the greatest success in the development of the village of evendale has been in its residential areas aerial photographs demonstrate that the development has preserved large green areas within the residential areas areas which in 1975 wore undeveloped have been fully developed as upscale singlefamily detached housing areas additional regulations have been established to protect these areas from encroachment by commercial establishments the annoyance of deterioration caused by developments in neighboring communities and to make all areas accessible to the safety service of the village 2other successes in village planning which should not be overlooked are the development of excellent public recreational facilities the development of a street system which moves large volumes of traffic in and out of one of the largest employers in the metropolitan area efficiently without long delays and traffic jams and the addition of commercial and office buildings on reading road passed 4292 122402 goals the following goals are general

established this is the planned business development which enables a large parcel with mixed uses to be developed in stages essentially a large parcel such as an office research parcel may be best developed with some commercial or industrial uses which are consistent with the primary office research internal use controls would assure that the subsidiary mixed use does not detract from the

a major artery to be built from glendalemilford road to the corner of sharon and mosteller roads this would serve two major objectives the first is to open remaining general industrial land to development the second and equally important is to provide better access to i275 frown existing industries in the village of evendale dthe final objective is to preserve both cooper and
