to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in section 42190a if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge along or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements c bypass  1 definitions a the term bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an industrial users treatment facility b the term severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which caused them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass the term severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production 2 exceptions an industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment

enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless 1 bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  2 there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and 3

one page following 110 111 112  floodplain management  statutory authorization findings of fact and purposes 1 statutory authorization the legislature of the state of kansas has in ksa 12707 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare therefore the city commission of coffeyville kansas ordains as follows 2 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the flood hazard areas of coffeyville kansas are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 3 general causes of these flood losses these flood losses are caused by a the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and b the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 4 methods used to analyze flood hazards this ordinance uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps a selection of regulatory flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the regulatory flood selected for this ordinance is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent 1% chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrations flood insurance study and illustrative materials dated january 1975 as amended and any future revisions thereto b calculation of water surface profiles based on a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and over bank areas to convey the regulatory flood c computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot 1 at any point 113 d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which is still subject to inundation by the regulatory flood 5 statement of purpose it is the purpose of floodplain management to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in 2 by applying the provisions of this ordinance to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities b require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction c protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard d assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the national flood insurance program  definitions unless specifically defined below the following words or phrases used in be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable application 1 actuarial or risk premium rates those rates established by the administrator pursuant to individual community studies and investigations which are undertaken to provide flood insurance in accordance with of the act and the accepted actuarial principles risk premium rates include provisions for operating costs and allowances 2 appeal a request for a review of the city engineers interpretation of any provision of this ordinance or a request for a variance 3 area of shallow flooding a designated ao or ah zone on a communitys firm with a one 1 percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one 114 to three 13 feet where a clearly defined channel is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow 4 area of special flood hazard the land in the flood plain within a community subject to one 1 percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year 5 base flood the flood having one 1 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year 6 development any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate including but not limited to buildings or other structures mining dredging filling grading paving excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials 7 existing construction for the purposes of determining rates structures for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the firm or before  for firms effective before that date existing construction may also be referred to as existing structures 8 flood or flooding a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from a the overflow of inland or tidal waters and b the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source 9 flood insurance rate map firm an official map of a community on which the flood insurance study has delineated the flood hazard boundaries and the zones establishing insurance rates applicable to the community 10 flood insurance study the official report by the federal emergency management agency the report contains flood profiles as well as the flood boundary floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood 11 floodway or regulatory flooding the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one 1 foot 12 floodway fringe that area of the flood plain outside of the floodway that on the average is likely to be flooded once every one hundred 100 years ie that has a one 1 percent chance of flood occurrence in any one year 13 freeboard a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of flood plain management freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions such as wave action clogged bridge openings and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed 115 14 highest adjacent grade the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure 15 historic structure any structure that is a listed individually in the national
