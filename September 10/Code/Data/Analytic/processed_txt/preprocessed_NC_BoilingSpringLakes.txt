of boiling spring lakes derives its name from the boiling spring which flows with an incredibly pure stream of water boiling spring lake is the largest of the fifty lakes within the city in 196 the developers of boiling spring lakes happened upon a gushing spring concealed in a wooded ravine wishing to beautify the area a fourfoot high brick wall was built to encompass this natural phenomenon almost before the masons had completed their work the spring suddenly stopped running within a few hours it burst out in a free full flow some fifteen feet outside the wall thousands of people have visited the site but as yet no one can account for the strange behavior of the spring many years ago the spring was known as bouncing log spring inasmuch as a large chunk of petrified wood was tossed and churned in the water gushing up out of the ground eventually there was no longer a log being bounced around by the upward thrust of groundwater and the name was changed to the boiling spring state geologists have calculated that the spring discharges approximately 43 million gallons of water each day the entire area seems enchanted with tall pines oaks and sweet gums hovering over the spring in the early spring damsel flies of red green and blue dart about the area and butterflies of all colors and descriptions flutter in the thickets legend has it that long ago indians would camp around the spring and hold their council meetings at this site on their annual trek to the atlantic ocean for oysters fish and game they always drank from the spring believing whomever drank from the spring

impact of a proposed development on the highway system when that system is at or near capacity or a safety problem exists its purpose is to insure that proposed developments do not adversely affect the highway network and to identify any traffic problems associated with access from the site to the existing transportation network the purpose of the study is also to identify solutions to potential problems and to present improvements to be incorporated into the proposed development  conduct a traffic impact study shall be prepared by a qualified professional traffic engineer andor certified transportation planner with previous traffic study experience the procedures and standards for the traffic impact study are set forth in this traffic impact study shall be referred to ncdot for review and comment prior to the preparation of a traffic impact study a scoping meeting shall be held including the planning staff the applicant and the preparer of the study the discussion at this meeting

will determine from that material whether or not to grant the exemption all exemptions shall be concurred with by the ncdot district 3 office if an exemption is granted documentation of the exemption will be submitted as part of the staff recommendation  capacity analysis of the existing system an indication of the adequacy of the existing street system is a comparison of traffic volumes versus the ability of the streets to move traffic freely at a desirable speed the ability of a street to move traffic freely safely and efficiently with a minimum delay is controlled primarily by the spacing of major devices utilized thus the ability of a street to move traffic can be increased by restricting parking and turning movements using proper sign and signal devices and by the application of other traffic engineering strategies capacity is the maximum number of vehicles which has a reasonable expectation of passing over a given section of roadway during a given time period under prevailing roadway and traffic conditions the relationship of traffic volumes to the capacity of the roadway will determine the level of service los being provided six levels of service have been selected for analysis purposes they are given letter designations from a to f with los a representing the best operating conditions and los f the worst a los a describes primarily free flow conditions the motorist experiences a high level of physical and psychological comfort the effects of minor incidents of breakdown are easily absorbed even at the maximum density the average spacing between vehicles is about 528 feet or 26 car lengths b los b represents reasonably free flow conditions the ability to maneuver within the traffic stream is only slightly restricted the lowest average spacing between vehicles is about 330 feet or 18 car lengths article 7 development standards 726 c los c provides for stable operations but flows approach the range in which small increases will cause substantial deterioration in service freedom to maneuver is noticeably restricted minor incidents may still be absorbed but the local decline in service will be great queues may be expected to form behind any significant blockage minimum average spacings are in the range of 220 feet or 11 car lengths d los d borders on unstable flow density begins to deteriorate somewhat more quickly with increasing flow small increases in flow can cause substantial deterioration in service freedom to maneuver is severely limited and the driver experiences drastically reduced comfort levels minor incidents can be expected to create substantial queuing at the limit vehicles are spaced at about 165 feet or nine car lengths e los e describes operation at capacity operations at this level are extremely unstable because there are virtually no usable gaps in the traffic system any disruption to the traffic stream such as a vehicle entering from a ramp or changing lanes requires the following vehicles to give way to admit the vehicle this can establish a disruption wave that propagates upstream traffic flow at capacity the traffic stream has no ability to dissipate any disruption any incident can be expected to produce a serious breakdown with extensive queuing vehicles are spaced at approximately six car lengths leaving little room to maneuver f los f describes forced or breakdown flow such conditions generally exist within queues forming behind breakdown points  general requirements and standards the traffic impact study shall contain the following information a

residential subdivision must have a minimum right of way width of twenty 20 feet which includes the travel way and associated drainage facilities any underground utilities may be located within the road right of way or a separate utility right of way note a private street within a minor residential subdivision may be required to provide a right of way of fifty 50 feet if the land and lots are arranged to allow the potential conversion of the road to a public road if the lot arrangement surrounding development pattern zoning and existing city plans indicate conversion is unlikely the udo administrator may allow a private road to reduce the right of way width to no less than twenty 20 feet future development will not be permitted to use the private street and will be required to upgrade such to the public street standards outlined herein for this reason it is encouraged that a minimum fifty 50 right of way be provided c single family detached dwellings may be created with access to a private street provided that 1 no more than four 4 lots may have their sole access to the private street  2 a new private street shall not be an extension of any existing public or private street  and 3 a new private street shall not be aligned with an existing public road in such a way as article 8 subdivision requirements 19 may interfere with any planned extension of the public road d the intent of this subsection is primarily to allow the creation of not more than four 4 lots with frontage on a private street for singlefamily development therefore the city may not approve any project served by a private street authorized by this subsection in which one 1 or more of the lots thereby created is intended for 1 twofamily or multifamily residential use or 2 any other residential use or nonresidential use that would tend to generate more traffic than that customarily generated by four 4 singlefamily residences e to ensure that the intent of this subsection is not subverted the udo administrator may among other possible options require that the approved plans show the types and locations of buildings on each lot or that restrictive covenants limiting the use of the subdivided property in accordance with this section be recorded before final plat approval f no final plat that shows lots served by private streets may be recorded unless the final plat contains the following notation further subdivision of any lot shown on this plat as served by a private street may be prohibited by the city of boiling spring lakes unified development g the recorded plat of

remodeling shall be as shown on the approved building permit application assessed value shall be based on the most recently available brunswick county tax records  remodeling of buildings or structures if a building permit is required for interior or exterior remodeling of the building or structure the remodeling or redevelopment shall require correction of existing onsite nonconforming offstreet parking landscaping perimeter buffer screening and signage in accordance with this section a 25 percent or less of structure value remodeling in any continuous oneyear period that costs 25 percent or less of the current assessed value of the structure shall not require any correction to nonconforming site aspects b more than 25 percent but less than 75 percent of structure value remodeling in any continuous oneyear period that costs more than 25 percent but less than 75 percent of the current assessed value of the structure shall require that a corresponding percentage of the

applicable is not required 1 example a hypothetical building is required to provide at least 40 offstreet parking spaces but the building site only includes 20 spaces if the building is article 12 nonconformities 6 remodeled such that the cost of remodeling equals 30 percent of the buildings assessed value the remodeling project must add 12 parking spaces 30% x 40 required spaces this increases the developments degree of compliance with offstreet parking standards from 50 percent 20 of 40 required spaces to 80 percent 32 of 40 required spaces c 75 percent or more of structure value remodeling projects that cost 75 percent or more of the current assessed value of the structure shall require 100 percent compliance with the offstreet parking sidewalk landscaping perimeter buffer

require that a corresponding percentage of the offstreet parking landscaping perimeter buffer screening and signage standards of this installed or upgraded on the site until the site achieves 100 percent compliance sidewalk installation if applicable is not required 1 example if the addition is 25 percent of the area of the existing structure and the site contains only 50 percent of the required landscaping 25 percent of the required landscaping for the entire site must be provided thereby bringing the landscaping on the site to 75 percent of the total required existing landscaping on the site shall be retained or replaced but shall not count toward the required percentage of new landscaping b expansion of greater than 50 percent of gross square footage over one year expansions over any continuous oneyear period which result in a greater than 50 percent increase of the gross square footage of the existing structure measured at the beginning of the oneyear period require the entire property to meet all of the offstreet parking sidewalk landscaping perimeter buffer screening and signage standards of this 6 nonconforming signs signs which were in existence prior to the
