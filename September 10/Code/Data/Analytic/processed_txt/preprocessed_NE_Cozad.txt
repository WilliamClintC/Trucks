floodprone area ctherefore the mayor and city council ordains as follows 1976  passed 4182011  15302 findings of fact aflood losses resulting from periodic inundation the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bgeneral causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages cmethods used to analyze flood hazards this chapter uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps 1selection of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood is selected for this chapter it is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a 1% chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrations flood insurance study and illustrative materials dated 532011 as amended  2calculation of water surface profiles based on a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood  3computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point  4delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any water surface increase along the floodway profile  and 5delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood 1976  passed 4182011  15303 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in  15302b of this chapter by applying the provisions of this chapter to arestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities  brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction  cprotect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard  and dassure that
