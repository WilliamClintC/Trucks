that is adaptable to urban densities while retaining many of the attractive features of the suburban home among the housing concepts emerging to meet this need are townhouses row houses garden apartments and similar types of housing units with common property areas cluster types of subdivisions in which housing units are arranged in cluster forms with clusters separated from each other by common open space and housing units developed with related recreational space such as golf courses swimming pools private parks community centers and other recreational facilities it is the purpose of this section to permit greater flexibility and encourage more imaginative design of large parcels in residential areas than is possible under conventional zoning regulations without sacrificing established values and rights to adequate light air noise and privacy rather than having specific standards applied to a development the process of negotiation will play a significant role negotiation

state highway transportation officials geometric design of highways and streets table of stopping sight distance these spacings are based on average vehicle acceleration and deceleration rates and are considered necessary to maintain safe stopping distances and traffic operation spacing will be measured from the midpoint of each driveway in the event that a particular parcel or parcels lack sufficient arterial frontage to maintain adequate spacing the landowners have the following options a the adjacent landowners may agree to establish a common driveway in compliance with the regulations stated herein the driveway must meet standard specifications and the estimated driveway volume will be the sum of the trip generation rate of all land uses in question a joint easement agreement among all properties involved must be entered into prior to an access permit being granted b if a common driveway cannot be established for reasons beyond the property owners both the proponent and adjacent landowners control the proponent can seek a variance from the zoning board of appeals from minimum spacing but in no case should the variance be greater than the next lowest

and performance standards may be considered plan review 12 temporary driveway permits temporary driveway permits are intended to allow existing driveways and new driveways necessary to access sites remote from adjacent access to remain in use until such time as the conditions specified on the permit are met a a temporary permit may be granted for i existing driveways that access existing development or are necessary to service farm fields and are only used for that purpose existing driveways are legal nonconforming driveways and may exist without a temporary permit under the conditions specified in subsection 13 nonconforming driveways ii new driveways necessary to access new development where the new development is remote from adjacent drives that shared access is not feasible at the time of development b conditions upon which the temporary permit will expire may include i adjacent development within 15 feet of the site where the temporary driveway is located is

provide for safe and efficient driveway operation d when a joint or coordinated accessparking system is being used when two adjacent property owners agree to combine access points the municipality may grant an incentive bonus the total road frontage normally required will each be reduced by ten percent for both landowners site circulation and safety standards will still be enforced e when a permittee seeks a variance for an innovative method for access design or operations variances should be granted only where practical difficulties require an innovative access design or dimensional change that is consistent with the intent of this may not be granted for financial hardship or in any instance where the intent of this be met by abiding by the standards in this document the saginaw
