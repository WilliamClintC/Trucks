uses after their reclassification as lawful permitted special or conditional city of park city zoning regulations   uses in these regulations to avoid nonconformities and to provide equitable conversions of such uses 1 where a use existed prior to the effective date of these regulations and was previously permitted only as a special use or as a conditional use ie an exception approved by the board of zoning appeals such uses shall not be deemed to be nonconforming but shall without further action be deemed to be a lawful special or conditional use as now classified with the same conditions applicable as originally established unless reclassified now as a permitted use 2 where a use existed prior to the effective date of these regulations and any prior regulations and was or is now classified as a special use or as a conditional use it shall be considered to be a lawful conforming special or conditional use enlargement extension or alterations to existing structures or land improvements for expansion of such lawful uses may be made within the area of the zoning lot which was actually used or occupied for such use on the effective date of these regulations and shall be subject to all requirements set forth in these regulations as a permitted use 107 registration of nonconformities and exemptions see d for nonconformities and 3100e for exemptions a purpose registration of nonconformities and exemptions among other purposes is to provide a property owner with a record of their nonconformity or exemption which may be in effect for many years such a record is very desirable since most nonconformities or exemptions are established in the past and the availability of personal witnesses and written documentation to confirm their status becomes more difficult due to the passage of time this is particularly important since the person claiming the nonconformity or exemption has the burden to prove their claim by the preponderance of the evidence registration can be especially useful to property owners who may have a nonconformity or exemption created by changing their zoning status from the unincorporated area of a county to the city regulations b rights conditioned a lawfully established nonconformity including exemptions is a vested right protected by due process which is sometimes referred to as being grandfatheredin in order to establish such a right it is essential that it be created or commenced prior to the enactment of the regulations which restricted its establishment a non conformity or exemption which violated the zoning regulations at its inception has no lawful right to continue once the validity of the nonconformity or exemption has been determined it has the right to be sold inherited transferred or assigned unless restricted by a condition attached to a special or conditional use certain limitations however may be placed on the expansion repair maintenance and continuance of such nonconformities or exemption as may be determined by the provisions of in these regulations for example continuance may be subject to abandonment or limited amortization of certain uses c registration process the zoning administrator shall establish a process for registration of nonconformities and exemptions and a system for making determinations thereof and keeping records of the same while there shall be no deadline for registration property owners anticipating the need for registration should do so at their earliest convenience city of park city zoning regulations   d registration determination the

are considered to be lesser changes due to their more restrictive characteristics as set forth in the zoning regulations when considering zoning district amendments the planning commission and the governing body may recommend and approve a lesser change in zoning districts for the property already advertised for a public hearing without republication of a notice or redistribution of notices to property owners when such change is more restrictive than the district which is applied for as shown on the table below  provided however that such recommendation and approval shall not be for a

special purpose for which the mh1 manufactured home park district c1 central business district gc general commercial district e1 entertainment district and po protective overlay district serve these districts are excluded from the table of comparability as well as the overlay zone established by the fp floodplain district although the notification for a special use is processed in the same manner as a zoning district amendment it is not an actual change in zoning districts and therefore the table of comparability does not apply and reapplication is necessary for consideration of a different use even if in the same zone the property considered for a special use however may be withdrawn by the applicant or a lesser amount recommended for approval without renotification city of park city

kansas department of agriculture on  city of park city zoning regulations  appendix  2 kansas statutory authorization the legislature of the state of kansas has in ksa 12741 et seq and specifically in ksa 12766 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare 3 findings of fact a the special flood hazard areas of the city of park city kansas are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this ordinance uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto 2 calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood 3 computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height 5 delineation of floodway fringe
