request any visible lighting must be submitted e new construction proposals for new construction need not seek to duplicate specific styles and historic periods what is to be sought is compatibility with existing historic structures harmony with adjacent buildings and areas is to be sought appropriate use of scale architectural elements materials details roof shapes and treatment of the grounds these six 6 characteristics are enumerated in some detail in the paragraphs which follow they may be used in conjunction with the material standards contained in this publication to evaluate the appropriateness of each new proposal in order for a proposal for a new structure to be acceptable it should not substantially contradict the following 1 scale new buildings should be in scale with existing buildings this will be taken to mean that the new building will not appear to be appreciably taller shorter wider narrower or bulkier than the average buildings adjacent to it and those in the district also the scale or size of elements will recall those of existing buildings to include size of windows doors railings masonry units siding balconies and dormers if used 2 materials predominant materials used on the buildings in the district are wood siding stucco brick and stone materials which are considered to be inappropriate are large manufactured panels of plywood hardboard plastic or asbestos imitation brick or stone though materials need not be limited to those which are existing the criterion for judgement will be whether or not the new compliments the old 3 details the details on new buildings should be compatible and in scale with those which are used in the area when used cornices lintels arches balustrades chimneys blinds and column styles which are sympathetic with adjacent existing details will have a unifying effect and will be considered favorably duplication is not necessary and is to be avoided 4 elements where they exist or predominate in a particular area porches balconies cupolas chimneys dormers and the like can be used to good effect in unifying a new structure with the neighborhood and will be considered as favorable when used in proper scale even though they need not seek to imitate historic styles likewise the use of compatible fences walls and paving will count in favor of a design if these elements exist to any extent in the adjacent area 5 roofs roof shapes and materials for new buildings should reflect the shape scale and style of existing buildings of the historic period there is no intention in this requirement to force designs into historic styles but rather to see that such a large and visible element of the building harmonizes with that of its neighbors 6 grounds site planning should respect the precedents set by other buildings in the block setback should be similar and landscaping which enhances the style of the district will be considered favorably for example in areas where many trees form a bower across the streets planting should be planned to achieve a similar effect at full growth where they exist the use of similar materials for paving such as brick tile pavers stone blocks or similar materials will be considered favorably walls and fences similar to existing examples in the area will likewise be favored d 6579 notification and building permit a upon receiving the order of the board the building inspector shall thereupon notify the applicant of the decision of the board if the board shall have approved the plans and if all other requirements of the city of mobile have been

this chapter for the various districts a separate building site is required for each building other than an accessory building for the purpose of allowing and encouraging variety of design and flexibility of location for buildings comprising a planned unit development pud under this section the requirement for a separate building site for each building is waived and the land occupied by the planned unit development is considered to be the building site for the group of buildings as a whole it is the further purpose of this section to encourage the unified development of tracts of land that are suitable in size location and character for the uses and buildings proposed to that end the application of the district regulations governing development on a lotbylot basis is modified for planned unit developments hereinafter called puds that meet the objectives and conform to the standards of this section although puds are most commonly multiplefamily residential projects such other building groups as shopping centers and industrial parks as well as onefamily residential projects using innovative building types and arrangements may be designed and developed under this section 2 objectives in pursuit of these purposes the objectives to be met by a pud are as follows a creative design to encourage innovative and diversified design in building form and site development  b flexibility to permit greater flexibility in the location and arrangement of buildings and uses than is generally possible under district regulations  c efficient land use to encourage the most efficient and sustainable use of land especially tracts in the inner part of the city that remain undeveloped or that are appropriate for redevelopment  d environment to preserve and protect as urban amenities the natural features and characteristics of the land  e open space to encourage the provision of common open space site design  f public services to encourage optimum use of available public utilities streets and community facilities 3 applicability a pud shall not be required for the addition of accessory structures on commercial sites if such structures are not associated with the primary use of the property are not occupy able or habitable are compliant with the district regulations do not diminish required site landscaping and trees and do not interfere with traffic circulation on the site b modifications and limitations 1 modifications of district regulations the provisions of this section are applicable in all districts the district regulations of the district in which the pud is located and the applicable supplementary regulations shall apply to a pud with the following modifications a permitted uses a pud shall contain only such uses as are permitted in

incidental services to the residents of the pud and shall be so located that traffic service and other aspects of their operation do not adversely affect the livability of the dwelling units in permitting business uses in a residential pud the planning commission may stipulate that no certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any business use until certificates of occupancy have been issued for all or a stated percentage of the total dwelling units contained in the pud as approved it is not the intent of this provision to permit the creation of b1 or b2 districts other than in accord with the amendment procedure of this chapter b residential building types in r1 districts each town house row house or similar building type with contiguous or party walls attached dwellings contained in a pud shall meet the building site area requirement of the r1 district for a onefamily dwelling in r2 districts each two 2 town houses row houses or similar building type with contiguous or party walls attached dwellings contained in a pud shall meet the building site area requirement of the r2 district for a twofamily dwelling in r3 and rb districts town houses row houses or similar building types with contiguous or party walls attached dwellings contained in a pud shall be considered to be multiplefamily dwellings and shall meet the building site area requirements of the r3 or rb districts for multiplefamily dwellings in the case of a pud which has also been approved by the planning commission as an innovative subdivision under the subdivision regulations part of the required building site area for each unit may be provided in common open space and minimum yards may be varied from those required in the district in which the pud is located c building site area in a residential pud building site area per dwelling unit may be reduced not to exceed twenty 20 percent where common open space provided justifies such reduction by its location character and intended use d yards required yard requirements of the district in which the pud is located shall apply to the pud as a whole rather than to individual buildings  provided however that wider or deeper yards may be required on the perimeter of the pud site in accord with the design standards of this section 2 limitations planned unit developments shall be subject to following limitations a size of tract the tract of land to be occupied by the pud shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the proposed uses and buildings in a homogeneous and harmonious entity as distinguished from typical lotbylot development b public services no pud shall be approved unless the planning commission determines upon advice of the appropriate authorities that the water sanitary and drainage facilities access streets and fire protection are adequate to meet the demands of the pud provided however that the planning commission may approve a pud prior to construction of such facilities access streets and fire

cornertocorner placement of buildings where walls do not overlap 1 spacing of buildings a building shall be located no closer to another building than a distance equal to the height of the taller building of the two 2  provided however that for a twostory building such distance shall be not less than thirty 30 feet in the case of two 2 walls having windows not less than twenty 20 feet in the case of one 1 wall having windows and the other no windows and not less than eight 8 feet in the case of two 2 walls having no windows  provided further that for buildings of more than two 2 stories spacing shall be increased proportionately variations from these spacing requirements may be made by the planning commission upon a showing that the arrangement of buildings is such that the orientation insures adequate light and air avoids undue exposure to trafficways and the parking and service areas of commercial establishments and preserves visual and auditory privacy between buildings 2 access by emergency vehicles the buildings in any pud shall be so arranged that every building is accessible to emergency vehicles c common open space in a residential pud consisting of multiplefamily dwellings at least seven hundred 700 square feet of land for each dwelling unit shall be in common open space common open space may contain walks terraces pools and the like but shall
