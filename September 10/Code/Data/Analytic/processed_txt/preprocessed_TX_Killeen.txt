in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage ch 9 art 6  1b i 41487 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that data are made available that will allow potential buyers to determine whether property is located in a floodplain ch 9 art 6  1c i 41487  i 92308 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which service such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling

movement of other vehicular and pedestrian traffic in and city or adversely affect the safety and health of the individuals participating or those normally situated immediately adjacent to the site of a parade or an assembly  or 2 the conduct of a proposed parade or assembly will require the use of a greater number of police officers of the city to properly police the assembly event than are regularly scheduled to be on duty at the proposed time and will substantially curtail necessary police protection of other areas of the city  or 3 the conduct of a parade or assembly will require the diversion of so great a number of the ambulances available in the city as to substantially curtail and interfere with necessary ambulance services to all individuals within any portion of the city  or 4 the concentration of individuals animals or vehicles at the proposed staging points of a proposed parade in the parade or at the proposed assembly will substantially interfere with the ability to provide necessary fire and police protection or ambulance service to and for the remainder of the individuals and portions of the city  or 5 the conduct of a parade or assembly will substantially and unreasonably interfere with and curtail necessary garbage collection or street cleaning services  or 6 the conduct of a parade or assembly will substantially interfere with and curtail necessary movement of firefighting equipment en route to fires or with the necessary movement of ambulances en route to emergencies  or 7 there is a high degree of probability or likelihood that the conduct of the particular proposed parade or assembly will cause or will tend to cause injury or damage to individuals persons or property or to provoke extremely disorderly conduct or to create a great disturbance of the peace  or to cause entry upon private property or upon public property lawfully dedicated to purposes which are inconsistent with the particular parade or assembly  or 8 a proposed parade is scheduled to move from its point of origin to its point of termination with delays en route entailing such a substantial total period of time as to thereby necessarily require an assembly permit  or 9 a proposed assembly is scheduled to convene and disperse at such time or times and in such manner means or methods as to require a parade permit  or 10 the route of a parade or the place of an assembly is so close to a building or place in or at which a school church or class thereof is in session or is so close to a particular building or place in or at which there is being conducted a specific lawful activity normally requiring for its accomplishment quiet and orderly deliberation and consideration or absence of and freedom from the intrusion of loud noise or disruptive acts similar to the requirements of a school and that the paraders or assemblers will in reasonable probability make noise or engage in acts that would cause or tend to cause imminent disruption and interference with the normal activity of such school class or other lawful activity or occupation with which such noises or disruptive acts are incompatible or inconsistent  or 11 the conduct of a particular proposed parade or assembly will necessarily result in an expenditure of so large a sum or sums of public monies that in relative proportion to other needs of the public for the use of the same public monies as to be unreasonable inequitable or confiscatory in nature and in determining same the city council may consider the total amount of monies expended for parades and assemblies held at the request of the same or substantially the same individuals and persons during the twelvemonth period immediately preceding the date for which the permit is sought  or 12 the particular individual or person or some substantial combination thereof seeking a permit has applied for and received a permit to parade or assemble for substantially the same purpose or purposes one 1 or more times during the twelvemonth period next immediately preceding the date for which the permit is being sought and therefore the issuance of another or new permit would unreasonably unfairly or inequitably prevent another applicant from obtaining a permit to parade or assemble  or 13 a permit for another parade or assembly has previously been issued scheduling and lawfully permitting another parade or assembly for the date sought by the applicant ch 13 art 7  7  111672  i 42898 modification of application the city manager or city council may modify in writing the route time number of

following three 3 conditions are met a the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage or no feasible alternatives existed as used in this paragraph severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities that causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources that can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass that occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance  and c the user

reserved division 8  planned unit development regulations description a planned unit development pud is a land use design incorporating the concepts of density and common open space common open space shall include but is not limited to community amenities such as parks gardens pedestrian trails recreation areas and usable undisturbed natural areas the pud designation serves as an overlay zoning and development classification in this capacity the designation permits specific negotiated development regulations to be applied to the base land use zoning districts in which the property is located when a parcel of land receives a pud designation the entire parcel must be assigned one or more standard zoning district classifications however the added pud overlay classification enables the developer of the site to request that specific land use development regulations be applied to his development site such specific land use and development regulations shall not take effect until they are reviewed public hearings held and approved by both the planning and zoning commission and the city council iii 102505   i 12914 purpose the pud classification is an overlay designation to provide the flexibility to permit development projects which may include multiple land uses this classification serves the following purposes a establish a procedure for the development of a parcel of land under unified control to reduce or eliminate the inflexibility that might otherwise result from strict application of land use standards and procedures designed primarily for individual lots  b ensure structured review and approval procedures are applied to unique development projects that intended to take advantage of common open space and promote pedestrian circulation  c allow developers greater freedom to be innovative in selecting the means to provide access light open space and amenities  and d provide flexibility from the strict application of existing development regulations and land use standards and allow developers the opportunity to take advantage of special site characteristics and location the regulatory provisions of this classification are intended to achieve the above purposes while maintaining the spirit of the current city of killeen development regulations as amended as such these provisions represent the governing bodys minimum quality of life standard and no variance or exception shall be granted thereto iii 102505 location districts and minimum requirements a pud may be permitted in any zoning district no pud may be located outside of the corporate

land use plan will be evaluated based on the compatibility of land uses to each other and the degree to which landscaping and screening are used to buffer less compatible land uses f yard sizes within the pud should generally follow guidelines for similar districts in the zoning ordinance  however modifications to the yard sizes and lot areas may be requested when the open space and common area amenities justify the overall deviation g open space landscaped buffers shall be required to separate land uses within the planned development from land uses adjacent to the planned development unless

by the city shall be placed in an open space buffer generally the minimum size of an open space buffer shall be twentyfive 25 feet measured from the property line the planning and zoning commission may recommend approval of puds with smaller open space buffers on a casebycase basis this buffer may be extended and screening andor landscaping may be required within the buffer based on the perceived degree of incompatibility between land uses or other criteria such as development density or topography as determined by the planning and zoning commission or the city council h parking area
