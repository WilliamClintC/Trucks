the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 2it is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate bdesignation of variance and appeal board the city shall establish a variance and appeal board consisting of three municipal offices to serve on appeals board cduties of variance and appeals board 1the variance and appeal board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of

during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water systems streets and bridges and culverts econditions for variances upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter the variance and appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter 1variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 2variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 3variances shall only be issued upon aa showing of good and sufficient cause  ba determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and ca determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height additional threats to public safety cause extraordinary public expense create nuisance as defined in the definition section under public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization of the public as defined in the definition section or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 4any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the lowest floor being situated below the base flood elevation 5the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency fema upon request 6variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of division d above are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance fvariance notification any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage  2such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the citys recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land  and 3the floodplain administrator shall

permitted in floodways uses permitted in floodways must always be those which do not endanger human life or increase flood damage by raising water heights or increasing flood velocities sound foundations and footings and adequate deviations to minimize flood damage are required for any structure allowed in the floodway and no earth fills may be permitted which would have the effect of

to rainfall and which will be in substantial conformity to the adjoining land area b the banks of all sand and gravel excavations in a water producing excavation and to the pit bottom in a dry operation shall be sloped to the water line at a slope which will not be less than three 3 feet horizontal to one foot vertical and said banks shall be restored with vegetation in a manner set forth

adopted and of these zoning regulations b the location and size of the use the nature and intensity of the operations involved in or conducted in connection with it the size of the site in relation to it and the location of the site with respect to streets giving access to it are such that it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the zone in which it is located 94 c the location nature and height of buildings walls and fences and the nature and extent of the landscaping on the site are such that the use will not hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings d operations in connection with any conditional use will not be more objectionable to nearby properties by reason of noise fumes vibration or other characteristics than would be the operations of any permitted use not requiring a conditional use permit e parking areas will be of adequate size for the particular use properly located and suitably screened from adjoining residential uses and the entrance and exit drives shall be laid out to achieve maximum safety f public utility service electricity sewerage storm drainage and water will be adequate to
