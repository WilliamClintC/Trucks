the illegal use of controlled substances within the city creates serious social medical and law enforcement problems the illegal use of such substances by persons under eighteen years of age has reached serious dimensions it is causing serious physical and psychological damage to the youth of this community an impairment of educational achievement and of the efficiency of the educational system increases in nondrugrelated crime and a threat to the ability of the community to ensure future generations of responsible and productive adults all to the detriment of the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city b the proliferation of the display of drug paraphernalia in retail stores within the city and the distribution of such paraphernalia will intensify and otherwise compound the problem of illegal use of controlled substances within this community c a ban only upon the display and distribution of drug paraphernalia to persons under eighteen years of age would not be practical the person who displays or distributes would have difficulty determining who could lawfully view or receive drug paraphernalia the already thinly staffed law enforcement agencies would be subjected to added enforcement burdens by adding age of a person who views or receives paraphernalia as an element of a prohibition upon display and distribution a significant number of high school students are eighteen years of age or older it would be lawful to distribute paraphernalia to some students attending the same school in which the distribution to other students would be prohibited permitted display and distribution to adults within the community would symbolize a public tolerance of illegal drug use making it difficult to explain the rationale of programs directed against similar abuse by youth the problem of illegal consumption of controlled substances by adults within this community is significant and substantial necessitating a cessation of the encouragement to drug abuse which the display and distribution of drug paraphernalia create d this chapter is a measure which is necessary in order to discourage the illegal use of controlled substances within the city

specific prohibitions in b of this division if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 2 no local limit

prohibited and the department may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless i bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  ii there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime

in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 2 it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b appeal board 1 in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the a danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where

development  h relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and k costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges 2 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the shasta county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 3 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency c conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local chapter 5 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in this chapter to the applicant  and c determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of c1 5 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 7 upon consideration of the factors of b1 and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  exh a part 1997  exh a part 1987 building numbering   required all entrances to buildings and

findings re park capital improvement fees the city council makes the following findings and determinations required by california government in regard to the park capital improvement fees assessed and levied pursuant to the provisions of this chapter a the city council finds that the presence of park facilities within the city contributes significantly to the beauty and ambience of the city and to the physical health and emotional wellbeing of its residents the city council also finds that new residential development occurring within the city will create a need for the acquisition and development of additional park facilities within the city in that the citys existing park facilities are insufficient in number size location and the kinds of recreational opportunities which they present to meet the park and recreational needs of both the existing residents of the city plus those additional residents of the city who eventually inhabit such new residential development in particular the city council based on the general plan finds that new residential development occurring within the city will create the need for at least three acres of neighborhood and community park facilities developed primarily for active recreational pursuits for every one thousand new residents who eventually inhabit such new residential development by reason of the foregoing the city council determines that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the park facilities to be funded with the park capital improvement fees provided for by this chapter and the residential development upon which such fees are imposed b the city council finds that all revenues from the park capital improvement fees assessed and levied on new residential development pursuant to the provisions of this chapter will be used for the acquisition and development of additional park facilities within the city which will meet the need for such facilities caused by such new residential development in particular the city council finds that in accordance with the provisions of this chapter all revenues from the park capital improvement fees assessed and levied on new residential development pursuant to the provisions of this chapter must be deposited in the park capital improvement fee fund and thereafter appropriated by the city council for the acquisition and development of either neighborhood park facilities or community park facilities of benefit to the persons residing in the residential development upon which the fees are imposed by reason of the foregoing the city council determines that there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the park capital improvement fees provided for by this chapter and the residential development upon which such fees are imposed c the city council finds that the park capital improvement fees assessed and levied on new residential development pursuant to the provisions of this chapter will not exceed that which is necessary to fund the park facilities attributable to the new residential development upon which the fees are imposed in particular the city council finds that in accordance with the provisions of this chapter the park capital improvement fees assessed and levied on new residential development will be equal to that amount necessary to fund the three acres of neighborhood and community park facilities heretofore found to be necessary for every one thousand new residents which eventually inhabit such new development by reason of the foregoing the city council determines that there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the park capital improvement fees provided for by this chapter and the cost of the park facilities attributable to the new residential development upon which the fees are imposed  part 1990   definitions re park capital improvement fees unless the contrary is stated or clearly appears from the context the following definitions shall govern the

allowed uses and form based standards   purpose intent and applicability a intent the purpose of this to establish unique allowed use and development standards for subject property within the mixed use area as defined by the city of anderson zoning is the intent of these standards to help preserve and protect the existing historic and unique character of downtown anderson by requiring new construction and remodels and existing construction to enhance the existing built environment and provide additional development opportunities additionally the application of these standards will enable the downtown area to become a pedestrianoriented shopping doing entertainment and living center for the city and environs b applicability of standards and entitlement review the standards of this chapter apply to all property zoned mixed use uses that require a use permit as listed in allowed use regulations shall obtain a use permit the downtown is also governed by a regulating plan that addresses how development interacts with the street and how the street is developed the application of both the zoning district and the regulating plan see mixed use district definitions for definition are described in more detail in defining the mixed use district and  regulating plan and street typologies and standards generally the zoning district designation mixed use defines the character and allowed use provisions for the subject site while the regulating plan defines the development standards setbacks building typology street standards c applicability of regulating plan standards generally the development standards applicable to a property shall be those for the respective zone and street frontage as reflected in the regulating plan however for those properties that face onto multiple street frontages eg a corner lot or a double frontage lot the following shall apply 1 the development standards applicable to the site shall be reflective of the individual sides of the lot for instance if a corner lot faces street a and street b then that side of the lot facing street a shall be developed consistent with the standards for street a and the side facing street b shall be developed consistent with the standards for street b 2 at the corner the design shall merge and unify the two standards together such that a the more restrictive setback requirement shall prevail on that side of the corner for instance if street a has a fivefoot buildto line and street b has a zerofoot buildto line then that side facing street a shall be located at the fivefoot buildto line and the side facing street b shall be located at the zerofoot buildto line note in this example the building is not centered on the corner  this is consistent with the intent of this provision b the more restrictive design standards shall prevail on that side of the corner provided the two standards are architecturally integrated together for instance if street a allows for a stoop frontage and street b does not a stoop may be developed along the street a frontage but at the corner the design of the building must architecturally transition into a frontage type that is allowed along street b the same shall be true for allowed building types storefront regulations sign types and landscaping only those features allowed on that frontage may be developed on said frontage 2 in the case of allowed uses the least restrictive use provisions shall apply to the entire lot provided that the primary entrance for the use either faces the street with the least restrictive use regulations or preferred faces the intersectionstreet corner for instance if a corner lot faces street a and street b and street a allows a particular use by right and street b requires a conditional use permit for the same use then the use shall be allowed by right on that lot provided the primary entrance to the use is located facing street a or preferred facing the intersectionat the corner exh a 2009   introduction to the mixed use district a defining the mixed use district the mixed use district is the regulating document for development within downtown anderson the basis for this in two unique zoning districts the mixed usecommercial emphasis muc and the mixed useresidential emphasis mur the mixed use district recognizes the historic character of the downtown and identifies a special set of development standards allowed use regulations and other special use regulations that apply to new construction and qualifying remodelsexpansions the standards in this presented in a format that is unique to the downtownform based code form based zoning provides a method of regulating development to achieve a desired urban form form based provisions address the relationship between building facades and the public realm the form and mass of buildings and the size character and type of streets and blocks the central focus of form based provisions is the regulating plan that designates the appropriate form and character of development rather than only distinctions in landuse types which is the basis of conventional zoning this mixed use district also includes regulations for the streetthe space between buildings the historical context of the downtown includes how individual developments relate and interact with the street this is because the street acts as a unifying thread across all development b relationship to other zoning provisions generally the regulations of this chapter shall govern development within the downtown in cases where there is a conflict between the provisions of this chapter and the regulations elsewhere in the zoning this prevail however with regard to topics on which this silent provisions elsewhere in the zoning prevail exh a 2009   mixed use

typologies and standards a establishment of the regulating plan and street hierarchy and character in addition to the application of the mixed use district development within the downtown is also governed by the regulating plan the regulating plan codes development based upon the street it is located along this plan is based on the following street hierarchy and character and as illustrated on the regulating plan see figure 171 the regulating plan 1 main street east center street east street and ventura streeta main street is a primary street of downtown anderson and provides a social setting for the community it is pedestrianoriented and focused on rehabilitation of existing buildings as well as the development of new infill structures that are compatible with the uniquely small town character of the district this area benefits from the presence of specialty retail businesses restaurants nightlife and tourismoriented services residential uses that are designed to add activity to the street scene are encouraged 2 service streets freeman street and west center streetthe focus of service streets is to maximum maximize onstreet parking and provide vehicular access to the backs of buildings and parking lots or to serve the automotive type uses found along west center street 3 neighborhood streets south street howard street ferry street martha street and oak streetthe neighborhood streets of downtown anderson display a mix of local retail and residential development they have a more intimate nature than the other areas as reflected in the narrower sidewalks and streets and the abundance of street trees and landscaping neighborhood streets also provide the primary pedestrian routes between the residential and commercial portions of downtown 4 avenues north street and balls ferry roadavenues are more automobileoriented than the other streets and replace arterial roadways as these significant roadways pass as such avenues are an ideal location for regional commercial and family entertainment b street typologies and standards the purpose of this to provide roadway standards that will facilitate the creation of streets that are inviting multimodal public places for vehicular traffic bicyclists and pedestrians 1 street typologies a avenue avenues connect districts or regions and are capable of carrying a large amount of vehicular traffic while still maintaining a higher quality pedestrian environment and retailsupporting urban edge this street typology replaces an arterial in downtown the landscaping strip along the sides of the roadway should be designed to facilitate the safe passage of pedestrians it is suggested that the strip include a continuous landscaped area between the edge of the curb and the sidewalk this area should include street trees and lighting designed at a pedestrian scale landscape strips should be a minimum of five feet wide where a continuous landscape strip is not possible street trees should be provided within tree wells or at intersections within curb bulbouts wherever an avenue intersects with a main street or a neighborhood street the intersection should be designed to enhance pedestrian safety and convenience features may include pedestrian bulbouts differentiated accent paving within the intersection instreet crossing lights if there is no crosswalk signal and pedestrian refuge areas within the medians of avenues b main streets street trees should frequently interrupt the parking lanes to soften visual impact of the parked vehicles and to help cool the air heated by the pavement diagonal parking and wide sidewalks should create a safe inviting environment for both pedestrians and motorists wherever a main street intersects with an avenue or a neighborhood street the intersection should be designed to provide pedestrians with safe passage features may include pedestrian bulbouts differentiated accent paving within the intersection and instreet crossing lights if there is no crosswalk signal turning movements typically occur from within the main travel lanes however short one to twocar length turn pockets may be provided at some intersections in lieu of parking on one side of the street c neighborhood streets neighborhood streets are home to the majority of residential development in downtown anderson as well as a few small neighborhoodserving retail stores these streets have a more intimate nature than the other areas and because of this landscaping and larger street trees should frequently interrupt the parking lanes to soften visual impact of the parked vehicles and to help cool the air heated by the pavement a continuous landscape strip is not required d service streets the focus of service streets is to maximize onstreet parking and provide vehicular access to the backs of buildings and parking lots or to serve the automotive type uses customer entrances may be located off alleys but the primary entrance should face a main street neighborhood street or avenue if a lot has two frontages e alley alleys are narrow public drives serving commercial and residential development in commercial developments alleys provide the primary service access and loading areas for businesses customer entrances may also be located off of alleys in addition if it does not obstruct the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic portions of the alley may be used for outdoor retail space patios art gardens and related uses in residential development parking should be accessed via alleys alley street lighting and landscaping should be designed at a pedestrian scale with an emphasis on creating a safe and secure environment additionally landscaping shall not impede automobile or pedestrian visibility within or immediately adjacent to an alley f paseo paseos are local and private pathways serving pedestrians and bicyclists only and they may also provide limited service access during specified periods of the day in addition if it does not obstruct the flow of pedestrian traffic portions of the paseo may also be used for outdoor dining retail space patios art gardens and related uses these types of streets are not necessarily shown on the regulating plan but would be appropriate to include in the district as part of a unified development plan to connect uses and activities in a pedestrian orientation without additional public

sign design design color materials size and placement are all important in creating signs that are architecturally attractive and integrated into the overall site design signs that are compatible with the surroundings and effectively communicate a message will promote a quality visual environment the standards that follow address these issues and others  the standards are intended to help business owners provide quality signs that add to and support the character of downtown anderson a general design standards i design signs in harmony with the style and character of the development and as an integral design component of the building architecture building materials landscaping and overall site development ii sign letters and materials should be professionally designed and fabricated iii exposed conduit and tubing raceway is prohibited all transformers and other equipment shall be concealed iv all signs shall be maintained in good repair including the display surface which shall be kept neatly painted or posted v the exposed back of all signs visible to the public shall be suitably finished and maintained vi the use of retractable awnings as a signage tool is acceptable b placement i signs should be generally free of obstructions when viewed from different angles however trees or other landscaping that grow to a point that it obstructs the view of a sign or makes it illegible shall not be grounds for removal or trimming of the plants ii utilize a consistent proportion of signage to building scale such as onethird text to twothirds wall area or onefourth text to threefourths wall area see figure 1715 text scale c materials i paper and cloth signs are appropriate for interior temporary use only and are not permitted on the exterior of a building ii the use of neon is permitted if it fits with the style of the architecture eg art deco and is not a nuisance eg produces glare to the surrounding properties sign tips colors and materials use exterior materials finishes and colors in harmony with or an upgrade to those of the buildings or structures on site the selected materials need to contribute to the legibility of the sign for example glossy finishes are often difficult to read because of glare and reflections contrast is an important influence on the legibility of signs light letters on a dark background or dark letters on a light background are most legible limit the total number of colors used in any one sign small accents of several colors may make a sign unique and attractive but the competition between large areas of many different colors decreases readability d sign legibility i avoid spacing letters and words too close together crowding of letters words or lines will make any sign more difficult to read conversely overspacing these elements causes the viewer to read each item individually again obscuring the message as a general rule letters should not occupy more than 75 percent of the sign panel area sign tips legibility use a brief message whenever possible fewer words help produce a more effective sign a sign with a brief succinct message is easier to read and looks more attractive limit the number of lettering styles in order to increase legibility a general rule to follow is to limit the number of different letter types to no more than two for small signs and three for large signs use symbols and logos in the place of words whenever appropriate pictographic images will usually register more quickly in the viewers mind than a written message avoid hardtoread overly intricate typefaces and symbols typefaces and symbols that are hard to read reduce the signs ability to communicate e sign illumination i the light from an illuminated sign shall not be of an intensity or brightness that will create glare or other negative impact on residential properties in direct line of sight to the sign ii whenever indirect lighting fixtures are used fluorescent or incandescent care shall be taken to properly shield the light source to prevent glare from spilling over into residential areas and any public rightofway iii reserved iv reserved v internally illuminated plastic box canned signs are prohibited individually illuminated channel letters are acceptable vi signs shall not have blinking flashing or fluttering lights or other illumination devices that have a changing light intensity brightness or color vii light sources shall utilize energyefficient fixtures to the greatest extent possible and shall comply with title 24 of the california regulations california building standards  sign tips illumination if the sign can be illuminated by an indirect source of light this is usually the best arrangement because the sign will appear to be better integrated with the buildings architecture light fixtures attached to the front of the structure cast light on the sign and the face of the structure as well individually illuminated letters should be backfill signs composed of individual letters mounted directly on a structure can often use a distinctive element of the structures facade as a backdrop thereby providing a better integration of the sign with the structure k landscaping
