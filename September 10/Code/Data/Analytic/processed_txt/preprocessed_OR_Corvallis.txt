construct and install all water sanitary sewer storm sewer and street improvements necessary to serve proposed developments these improvements are constructed in accordance with city design and construction standards and later dedicated to the city as public improvements often these street water sanitary sewer and storm sewer improvements particularly those constructed offsite can and will benefit other property owners when they develop their property therefore these improvements represent a benefit to those property owners 2 the purpose of this to provide a mechanism where property which benefits from the construction of public improvements by another person will share in the cost of those improvements of a recovery charge at the time of connection or initiation of development activity that would otherwise require extension of public utilities and transportation improvements per the land development a mechanism for the city to examine the improvements which are constructed their cost the properties which are specially benefitted by them and will provide a reasonable method of apportioning the reimbursable costs among benefitted properties the purpose of this the municipal not to encourage development but to ensure that development pays for its share of benefits 3 property owners whose property would be subject to the recovery charge fee will be provided an opportunity to review and comment on pertinent information prior to the city establishing a recovery charge pursuant to this city will collect recovery charges and upon receipt will forward such funds to the person who constructed the improvements 4 the recovery charges established under this intended to become due and payable at the time of connection or initiation of development activity that would otherwise require extension of public utilities and transportation improvements per the land development charges are fees for service because they contemplate a developments receipt of essential municipal services based upon the nature of that development the timing and extent of any development are within the control and discretion of the developer furthermore the recovery charges imposed by this not intended to be a tax on property or on a property owner as a direct consequence of ownership of property within the meaning of of the oregon constitution or the legislation implementing that

wastewater system and the customer has not notified the utility that the property is vacant and wastewater service is no longer required consumption for wastewater service is generally based on the water used as measured on the utilitys water meter if the customer does not have utility provided water service and the wastewater system is connected to the property the wastewater service is

may bill the customer for water consumed while the meter was not registering the bill will be at the minimum monthly meter rate or will be computed upon an estimate of consumption based either upon the customers prior use during the same season of the year or upon a reasonable comparison with the use of other customers receiving the same class of service during the same period and under similar circumstances and conditions the bill will be for the period of time that the meter was not registering 2 adjustments due to underground leaks where a leak exists underground between the meter and the building or where the leak is otherwise undetectable and the same is repaired within a reasonable time after the owner agent or occupant of the premises has been notified of such leakage the utility may allow an adjustment of 50 percent of the estimated excess water consumption for a period not exceeding two months that the meter was in use when the nature of the leak is such that the leak drained into the wastewater system then the wastewater charges may be adjusted for 50 percent of the estimated excess wastewater consumption for a period not exceeding two months that the meter was in use when the leak does not drain into the wastewater system then 100 percent of the estimated excess wastewater consumption may be adjusted for a period not exceeding two months the adjustment will be computed upon an estimate of consumption based either upon the customers use during the same season of the year prior or upon a reasonable comparison with the use of other customers receiving the same

costs to the city associated with the operation of a rental housing program there is hereby imposed an annual fee to be set by the city council for each dwelling unit covered by a rental agreement 1 rental property registry owners of residential rental units located within the corvallis city limits shall register said units with the city of corvallis determined methods before allowing the property to be occupied by a tenant the property owner shall furnish the following information and notify the city within 30 days of any change rental property address  total number of units per property  owners name and primary contact information including mailing address and phone or email address a property owner may designate an agent as the primary contact for registration purposes 2 fraternities & sororities the total annual fee for fraternities sororities and other similar group living structures shall be calculated based on the occupancy capacity of each structure divided by

in every oddnumbered year thereafter 4 fee exemptions the following unit types while subject to the requirements of shall be exempt from the fee payment requirements of this rentals with a recorded deed restriction requiring the units to be rented affordably to households at or below 50% of the area median income  and rentals designated as senior or disabled housing by a public agency rentals under contract with a public agency that requires the rental to be inspected and verifies that the dwelling is rented to a low income household are exempt upon request of the property owner or their agent and after confirmation by city staff 5 fee collection the property owner is responsible for paying the annual fee the information provided in the rental property registry will be used for invoicing purposes the director shall maintain policies and procedures that include written or electronic communications with property owners or their agents before assessing a penalty 6 findings on penalties the city council finds that it is in the best interest of the public for city staff to facilitate collaborative solutions to conflicts between landlords and tenants within the city of corvallis and for city staff to provide education for these landlords and tenants with respect to their rights and responsibilities under city ordinances and state law the city council finds that part of the costs for the city to provide this program are intended to be paid for by the annual fees but the city council does not desire this program to greatly increase the cost of renting residential property within the city the city council finds that an artificially lower annual fee that encourages timely payment is more likely to provide reliable funding that somewhat offsets the costs of this essential program than is a higher fee which could spread the actual administrative costs of enforcement and collection across all of the annual fee payers but could require more enforcement the city council has balanced raising the amount of the annual fee to completely pay the cost of the program against the desire for landlords to pay the annual fee in a timely manner the city finds that the staff charged with administration of this program spend a grossly disproportionate portion of their time attempting to collect fees or to collect late fees from a relatively few property owners or their agents the city council finds that if the city assessed relatively low penalties for failing to pay the annual fee or for failing to pay the annual fee in a timely manner the lower penalty would encourage some property owners or agents to fail to pay fees or to pay late fees the city council finds that relatively low penalties for failing to pay the annual fee or for late payment of the fee would therefore unfairly require other landlords property owners agents and property taxpayers at large to pay for the cost of this service and to subsidize the additional administration and cost required by the failure of these relatively few landlords property owners or their agents to pay the required fees the city council concludes that low penalties would threaten the citys ability to provide the service for the low annual fee accordingly the council finds that the amounts of the penalties established in this calculated to recover all of the real administrative costs of collection and enforcement of this requiring people who comply with the requirements of this subsidize these few violators failure to report a residential rental property or to pay the program fee will result in a penalty fee 7 penalties a failure to report a residential rental property rental properties not registered with the city of corvallis by  and on an ongoing basis thereafter will incur a civil penalty fee per unit which shall be assessed to the property owner as such units are confirmed by the city the amount of the penalty fee shall be based on the city managers fee schedule b failure to pay the annual program fee failure to pay the annual program fee by the date specified in the invoice or statement will result in a civil penalty fee per unit assessed to the property owner the amount of the penalty fee shall be based on the city managers fee schedule c the city will initiate appropriate action to collect the fees due and all costs associated with these actions will be assessed to the property owner appropriate action may include sending the account to a collection agency for action or placing a lien on the subject property  2    1          1  special fees the following fees

process for the adoption of the plan has been conducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of of the oregon revised statutes and all other applicable legal requirements  2 the area designated in the plan as the south corvallis urban renewal area area is blighted as defined by ors 1 and is eligible for inclusion within the plan because of conditions described in the report in the existing physical social and economic conditions and impacts on municipal services including the existence of inadequate streets and other rights of way open spaces and utilities and underdevelopment of property within the area ors 1e and g  3 the rehabilitation and redevelopment described in the plan to be undertaken by the agency is necessary to protect the public health safety or welfare of the city because absent the completion of urban renewal projects the area will fail to contribute its fair share of property tax revenues to support city services and will fail to develop andor redevelop according the goals of the citys comprehensive plan  4 the plan conforms to the corvallis comprehensive plan and provides an outline for accomplishing the projects described in the plan as more fully described in of the plan and in the corvallis planning commission determination of compliance with the comprehensive plan  5 the plan conforms to the corvallis economic development plan as more fully described in of the plan  6 no residential displacement will occur as a result of the acquisition and disposition of land and redevelopment activities proposed in the plan and therefore the plan does not include provisions to house displaced persons  7 the plan authorizes agency acquisition of any interest in property within the area that the agency finds is necessary for private redevelopment but only in those cases where the property owner wishes to convey such interest to the agency  and 8 adoption and carrying out the plan is economically sound and feasible in that eligible projects and activities will be funded by urban renewal tax revenues derived from a division of taxes pursuant to section 1c of the oregon constitution and ors  and other available funding as more fully described

the special flood hazard areas to assume responsibility for their actions  n manage the alteration of special flood hazard areas stream channels and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain  and o methods of reducing flood losses  in order to accomplish its purpose this chapter and floodplain development permit include methods and provisions to 1 require that development that is vulnerable to floods including buildings structures and facilities necessary for the general health safety and welfare of citizens be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  2 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  3 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion  4 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazards to other lands  5 preserve and restore natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which carry and store flood waters and  6 coordinate with and supplement provisions of oregon building codes  and corvallis land development as amended floodplain provisions  of 41 p to advance these purposes where not required creation of open space tracts is encouraged within areas designated as natural resources or natural hazards on the comprehensive plan and official zoning maps applicability 01  natural hazards that are subject to this these provisions apply to public and private properties in the 100yr floodplain of rivers and local streams  b mapping of natural hazards  the natural hazard areas in

prohibited areas or if the cumulative impact of such natural hazard regulations and the application of the regulations in significant vegetation protection provisions and riparian corridor and wetland provisions would limit the developable portion of a property below the propertys mada then development will be allowed on the property to the degree necessary to achieve the mada as explained in minimum assured development area however use of mada provisions to develop in the 02feet  floodway is prohibited as outlined in 03 as well as of minimum assured development area  and b floodway fringe

grading and individual lot grading must be contained within the same grading limitation areas the amount of gradable area allowed per lot is the same under both standards this means that when mass grading is employed the area that is mass graded on an individual lot will be the area in which individual lot grading is allowed unless the mass graded area is less than the maximum gradable area allowed in this case additional area up to the maximum allowed can be graded at the time of individual lot grading 2 the remaining provisions of this 04c e below are organized as follows a mass

refinements are adjustments made analyses to refine the actual boundaries of some natural resources and natural hazards map refinements must be made in accordance with the provisions in floodplain provisions riparian corridor and wetland provisions and landslide hazard and hillside development provisions the map refinements governed by this chapter are specifically allowed to determine the location and extent of the a landslide hazard areas  and b slopes corvallis land development as amended landslide hazard and hillside development provisions  of 25 02  map refinements provisions map refinement provisions for landslide hazard areas and slopes are outlined below map refinement provisions for the 02feet  floodway the 10feet  floodway and the 100yr floodway fringe are outlined in floodplain provisions map refinement provisions for topofbank riparian corridor and wetland boundaries are outlined in riparian corridor and wetland provisions map refinements are also adjustments to resolve registration issues that may occur between different gis layers or maps a landslide hazard area boundaries  the precise locations of landslide hazard area boundaries are determined by one of the following two methods 1 site assessments andor geotechnical reports as required per   or 2 information provided by the oregon department of geology and mining industries dogami once it has been developed and finalized by dogami if these areas are not precisely mapped by one of these two methods the 500feet  setback required by shall be maintained b slope boundaries  the precise locations of the steep slope boundaries are determined by one of the following two methods consistent with the provisions of  1 using the information from the natural hazards database and creating a topographic map of the development site showing twofeet  contour intervals  or 2 using a topographic survey showing twofeet  contour intervals prepared and stamped by a licensed surveyor or civil engineer 03  map refinement procedures adjustments to maps consistent with the provisions of 02 above are considered to be map refinements and may be ministerially adjusted on the relevant maps with no land use process required other than a demonstrated adherence to the provisions of sections 01 and 02 corvallis land development as amended landslide hazard and hillside development provisions  of 25   map corrections no zone change or comprehensive plan map amendment shall be required to accomplish map corrections approved in accordance with the provisions outlined in this decisions regarding map correction requests shall be made by the community development director as specified in sections 01 and 02 below upon approval of a map correction request the director shall ensure that changes are reflected in the citys affected maps and databases notice of such map correction shall be provided to decisionmakers as outlined in b below b when requests for five map corrections on any natural hazard or natural resource for which a map correction is allowed have been submitted to and decided upon by the community development department director or approximately twice a year whichever is sooner the map correction requests shall be summarized in an informational memo for decisionmakers so that they may review them for tracking purposes in accordance with comprehensive plan policy  this memo shall be shared with the corvallis planning commission and city council for map correction requests on lands within the city limits  and with the corvallis and benton county planning commissions the corvallis city council and the benton county board of commissioners for map correction requests on lands within the urban fringe 01  map corrections defined a a map correction is not the type of adjustment described in the map refinement provisions of above a map correction is however an actual correction to maps referencing natural hazards or natural resources other than significant vegetation areas where it is found that the map depiction does not reflect the natural features inventory as the natural features inventory nfi was the basis for developing the citys maps that reference natural hazards and natural resources a correction to the nfi for natural hazards or natural resources other than significant vegetation areas could result in a correction to the related maps these maps include the comprehensive plan map local wetlands inventory map official zoning map natural hazards map or riparian corridors and wetlands map map correction provisions for landslide hazard areas are outlined below adjustments to other hazards governed by this chapter are not map corrections but are map refinements and are addressed provisions of above there are no map correction provisions for the 100year floodplain since corrections are accomplished map refinement provisions in floodplain corvallis land development as amended landslide hazard and hillside development provisions  of 25 provisions map correction provisions for riparian corridor widths and wetland boundaries are outlined in riparian corridor and wetland provisions b landslide hazard areas  landslide hazard area boundaries may be refined map refinement procedures outlined in  above however if technical data demonstrates that no landslide hazard exists within or near an area identified as a potential landslide hazard on the citys maps a map correction may be accomplished to delete the landslide hazard indication from the maps such technical data must be from 1 a site assessment and geotechnical report  or 2 the oregon department of geology and mining industries dogami 02  map corrections procedures for landslide hazard areas there are two procedures available for a map correction involving the removal of a landslide hazard area from the natural hazards map a removal of a landslide hazard area from determination by the oregon department of geology and mining industries dogami  if in finalizing its data and maps regarding landslide hazard areas the oregon department of geology and mining industries dogami determines that no landslide hazard exists within or near an area identified as a potential landslide hazard on the natural hazards map then a map correction to remove indication of the landslide hazard area shall be done by the community development department director following written verification of the dogamis determination when such written documentation of the determination is provided to the director the director shall ensure that the changes reflected by the dogami decision are reflected in the citys affected maps and databases b removal of a landslide hazard area from determinations reached by a site assessment and geotechnical report  if a property owner or property owners legal representative provides the community development department director with the items listed in  below a request to remove indication of a landslide hazard area from the natural hazards map and other affected maps may be considered as outlined in  and  below corvallis land development as amended landslide hazard and hillside development provisions  of 25 1 for a map correction request to consider removal of a landslide hazard from the natural hazards map and other related maps the following information is required a a site assessment and geotechnical report which meet the criteria identified in sections 04 and 05 in addition to the items identified in the geotechnical report shall specifically address the lack of presence characteristics andor precise location of the identified hazards on the subject property which isare depicted on the natural hazards map if other reports are called for by the site assessment these reports shall also be submitted  and b an indemnification and release agreement in accordance with the provisions of   2 for lands within the city limits map correction requests shall be reviewed by the building official and city engineer in coordination with the community development department the community development director shall make the final decision for lands within the urban fringe map correction requests shall be reviewed by the building official and city engineer in coordination with the corvallis community development department and the benton county development department for the urban fringe lands the corvallis community development department director shall also make the final decision 3 to approve a map correction request the director must find that a the information required by  above has been provided and is complete  b the required technical reports and recommendations sufficiently demonstrate that there is no landslide hazard on or near the area identified on the natural hazards map  and c the required technical reports and recommendations sufficiently demonstrate that development on the subject area would not increase landslide risks on the development site or upon neighboring properties
