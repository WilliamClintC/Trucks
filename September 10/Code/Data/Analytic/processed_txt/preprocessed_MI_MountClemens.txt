without further governmental action thenceforth acquire and be subject to the same zoning regulations as are applicable to the lands to which same shall attach   gratiot avenue corridor overlay zone a intent the intent of the gratiot avenue corridor overlay zone is to improve traffic operations  reduce potential for crashes  improve pedestrian and transit environments  and preserve the vehicular carrying capacity of gratiot avenue on the number spacing placement and design of access points driveways and intersections published reports and recommendations by the michigan department of transportation mdot show a relationship between the number of access points and the number of crashes recognizing the existing built character and downtown land use characteristics in mount clemens relative to those of other communities along the gratiot avenue corridor this ordinance intends to apply the mdot access management standards where practical but to allow flexibility in their application given the unique needs of this more urbanized area the segment of gratiot avenue within mount clemens splits into north bound and south bound components referred to as oneway pairs which present unique traffic operations  therefore this ordinance places less emphasis on the spacing and offsets of access from other driveways and greater emphasis on the design and placement of driveways relative to other nearby access and intersections especially signalized intersections b applicability this overlay zone shall apply to all land with frontage along gratiot avenue except for singlefamily homes duplexes or essential service facility structures the following applications must comply with the standards in this section 1 new or enlarged building or structure any new principal building or structure or the enlargement of any principal building or structure by more than 25% 2 land division subdivision or site condominium any land division or subdivision or site condominium development including residential developments 3 change in use or intensity of use any intensity of use as defined in c c or any increase in vehicle trips generated c access management standards the

number of driveways the number of resulting driveways shall be the fewest necessary to provide reasonable access to the site each lot shall be permitted one driveway which may consist of an individual driveway a shared access with an adjacent use or access via a service drive 3 offsets and spacing from intersections driveways shall be either directly aligned or spacedoffset as far from intersections as practical especially signalized intersections a minimum spacing or offset of 150 feet is preferred 4 spacing from other driveways on the same side of gratiot driveways shall be spacedoffset as far as practical from other driveways along gratiot a minimum spacing of 150 feet is preferred 5 offsets from driveways on the opposite side of gratiot driveways shall be either aligned with driveways on the opposite side of gratiot or offset to the greatest distance practical consideration for weaving across travel lanes shall be given especially where signalized intersections are present 6 consideration of adjacent sites where the subject site adjoins land that may be developed or redeveloped in the future the access shall be located to ensure the adjacent sites can also meet the access location standards in the future 7 shared driveways where direct access consistent with the above regulations cannot be achieved access should be provided via a shared driveway or service drive 8 access design where practical given rightofway constraints driveways shall be designed with radii tapers and other geometrics as determined by mdot that are required to minimize the impacts of inbound right turns on traffic flow d review procedure it is recognized that certain existing site conditions may prohibit full compliance with this to the standards herein may be permitted by the planning commission according to the following procedure 1 submittal information along with any other required information developments subject to review according to this submit a detailed information showing nearby intersections  existing driveways on adjacent sites  proposed driveways  changes to existing access  and any information requested by the city necessary to review site access b the planning commission may require submittal of a traffic impact report prepared by a qualified traffic engineer to verify the need for additional driveways or to justify a modification 2 allowed modifications the planning commission may after considering the criteria in #3 below modify the standards of this the following situations a the modification will allow an existing driveway to remain that does not meet the standards of this that has or is expected to have very low traffic volumes less than 50 in and outbound trips per day and is not expected to significantly impact safe traffic operations b the use is expected to generate a relatively high number of trips and an additional driveway will improve overall traffic operations c practical difficulties exist on the site that make compliance unreasonable sight distance limitations existing development topography unique site configuration or shape or existing offsite driveways make it impractical to fully comply with the standards d because of restricted turning movements or presence of a median that restricts turning movements the driveway does not contribute to congestion or an unsafe situation 3 modification criteria the planning commission may waive certain requirements of this consideration of the following a the proposed modification is consistent with the general intent of the standards of this overlay zone the recommendations of the gratiot avenue corridor improvement plan and published mdot guidelines b mdot staff endorse the proposed access design c driveway geometrics have been improved to the extent practical to reduce impacts on traffic flow d shared access has been provided or the applicant has demonstrated it is not practical e such modification is the minimum necessary to provide reasonable access will not impair public safety or prevent the logical development or redevelopment of adjacent sites and is not simply for convenience of the development ord eff oct 19 2009

use regulations in their residential neighborhood which would prohibit or restrict the rental uses of single family dwellings within the neighborhood these districts establish restrictions which operate to preserve the attractiveness desirability and privacy of residential neighborhoods by precluding all or certain types of rental properties and thereby preclude the deleterious effects rental properties can have on a neighborhood with regard to property deterioration increased density congestion crime noise and traffic levels and reduction of property values the goal of the overlay district is to allow owners of property within residential neighborhoods to control the types of rental properties if any that are permitted in onefamily dwellings within their neighborhood 2 it is also the purpose of the districts to achieve the following objectives a to protect the privacy of residents and to minimize noise congestion and nuisance impacts by regulating the types of rental
