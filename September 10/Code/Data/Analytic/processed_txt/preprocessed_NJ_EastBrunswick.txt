of food is a significant source of litter and municipal waste disposal the chemical composition and ability of a substance to degrade are useful criteria in establishing a policy of solid waste and litter control polystyrene foam is not biodegradable retail food establishments in east brunswick are the points of origin for polystyrene foam their use of polystyrene foam poses a threat to the environment by taking up landfill space and by the possible introduction of carbon dioxide and ash when completely combusted there is no economically viable market for recycling polystyrene foam other plastic andor paper products are available as substitutes plastics constitute 6% of all roadside litter according to a study commissioned by the federal highway commission the disposal of polystyrene foam at sea has a very serious negative effect on marine life chlorofluorocarbons cfcs are chemical compounds used as an expansion agent in polystyrene foam food service products when released into the atmosphere cfcs rise to the stratosphere where they break down and release chlorine the chlorine then acts to reduce the stratospheric ozone layer causing an increase in the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching the earth the township council by enacting this ordinance is seeking to reduce the nonrecyclable nondegradable food packaging products and the council is also seeking to reduce the amount of litter adversely affecting the air land and waters of the township of east brunswick this ordinance will serve the public interest by reducing the quantity of nonbiodegradable waste in landfills serving east brunswick a portion of any substitute packaging will be composed of products that are biodegradable in whole or in part polystyrene foam packaging takes up more space in landfills than many other packaging materials because of the comparatively low density of polystyrene foam and its present popularity as a packaging material siting and developing landfills is an increasingly expensive undertaking and these costs place an economic burden on the residents or the township of east brunswick maximizing the operating life of landfill facilities therefore promotes the public interest and this interest will be served by reducing the amount of polystyrene foam deposited in landfills the council recognizes that other commonly used food packaging materials are also nonbiodegradable and contribute to litter and landfill problems  nevertheless the council finds that it is appropriate to regulate polystyrene foam food packaging while not regulating other types of food packaging at this time for the following reasons  10915 general provisions  10915   10916 definitions amended 82691 by  a to minimize disruption in the food services industry the council should avoid banning a wide range of packaging materials at one time it might be appropriate to ban other packaging materials in the future but an incremental approach to eliminating undesirable packaging materials will cause less disruption and allow the township of east brunswick to handle enforcement proceedings in more manageable stages b polystyrene foam is the least dense commonly used food packaging material and therefore is more wasteful of landfill space than any other category of food packaging material it is therefore appropriate to start with polystyrene foam as the township of east brunswick begins to address the issues of litter and inappropriate utilization of landfill space c ingestion of polystyrene foam particles has been identified as a hazard to wildlife while this problem has not been associated with other food packaging materials a biodegradable packaging shall mean packaging made of cellulose based substances or other substances which are capable of being readily attacked decomposed assimilated andor otherwise completely oxidized or broken down into its constituent parts by bacteria natural biological organisms carbonaceous soil material water carbon dioxide  or in the alternative capable of otherwise degrading when exposed to ultraviolet light or other natural processes beginning within a twelve month period from the date of manufacture or exposure to the environment b packaging shall mean all foodrelated wrappings including but not limited to bags sacks wrappings containers bowls plates trays cartons cups or drinking utensils intended for use within the township of east brunswick c prepared food means food or beverages which are served on the vendors premises without preparation or are prepared on the vendors premises by cooking chopping slicing mixing brewing freezing or squeezing prepared food does not include any raw uncooked meat fish poultry or eggs prepared food may be eaten either on or off premises amended 82691 by  d retail food vendor shall mean all sales outlets stores shops restaurants or other places of business located within the township of east brunswick which receive more than twenty 20% percent of their revenues sales or conveyances of foods directly to the ultimate consumer which foods are predominantly contained wrapped or held in or on packaging retail food vendors shall include but not be limited

gross revenues from the sale of said food or drink a no retail food vendor located and doing business in the township of east brunswick shall sell or convey prepared food directly to the ultimate consumer within the township of east brunswick if the packaging for such food consists of polystyrene foam or products in which pentane gas hydrocarbons fluorocarbons or similar gases are utilized during manufacture for the purposes of this section conclusion of the sales transaction shall be the point of time at which the possession of the food product passes from the retail food vendor to the ultimate consumer and the conclusion of the sales transaction need not require the actual payment of consideration for such food product provided however payment is expected from the ultimate consumer prior to the consumer exiting the premises of the retail food vendor b reserved deleted 82691 by  a the township of east brunswick shall not purchase any food packaging which contains polystyrene foam and will discontinue the use of polystyrene foam in connection with the packaging of food the township shall not sponsor any event which utilizes such packaging b the township clerk shall be directed to exclusively advertise for the receipt of bids for biodegradable materials whenever said bids are required by the township of east brunswick  10916 general provisions  10920  total elimination will require substantial financial commitments and should include public education to these ends the township council hereby directs the east brunswick environmental commission to make recommendations to

implementing specifications for the establishment protection and maintenance of vegetation along the surface water bodies within east brunswick township consistent with the interest of landowners in making reasonable economic use of parcels of land that include such designated areas the specific purposes and intent of this to a restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the townships water resources  b prevent excessive nutrients sediment and organic matter as well as biocides and other pollutants from reaching surface waters by optimizing opportunities for filtration deposition absorption adsorption plant uptake biodegradation and denitrification which occur when stormwater runoff is conveyed buffers as stable distributed flow prior to reaching receiving waters  c provide for shading of the aquatic environment so as to moderate temperatures retain more dissolved oxygen and support a healthy assemblage of aquatic flora and fauna  d provide for the availability of natural organic matter leaves and twigs and large woody debris trees and limbs that provide food and habitat for aquatic organisms insects amphibians crustaceans and small fish which are essential to maintain the food chain  e increase stream bank stability and maintain natural fluvial geomorphology of the stream system thereby reducing stream bank erosion and sedimentation and protecting habitat for aquatic organisms  f maintain base flows in streams and moisture in wetlands  g control downstream flooding  and h conserve the natural features important to land and water
