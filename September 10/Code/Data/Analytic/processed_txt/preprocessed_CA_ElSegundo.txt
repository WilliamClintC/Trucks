conducted in urbanized areas as the term is herein defined may be detrimental to the public health safety and general welfare  and that the extension of oil drilling into such areas in the city in which drilling has not already been permitted is justified only by reason of recognizing the material and social value of developing natural resources  that oil and other hydrocarbon substances constitute property within the meaning of the constitutional provisions guaranteeing the right of ownership and enjoyment of such property  by recognizing also the similar constitutional guarantees for the enjoyment of the surface use of real property and improvements thereon  and the need for invoking such reasonable controls over both the subsurface and surface use of property as may be necessary to assure maximum enjoyment of each with minimum restrictions to either it is therefore declared to be the object and purpose of this establish reasonable and uniform limitations safeguards and controls for the future drilling for and production of oil or other hydrocarbon substances in the urbanized areas of the city b more restrictive limitations safeguards and controls than those which have heretofore been imposed in metropolitan and urbanized areas are deemed necessary in the public interest to effect practices which will not only provide for a more economic recovery of oil gas and other hydrocarbon substances but which will also take into consideration the surface uses of land as such uses are indicated by the value and character of the existing improvements in or near

earthquakes on unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings constructed before 1934 such buildings have been widely recognized for their sustaining of life hazardous damage as a result of partial or complete collapse during past moderate to strong earthquakes b seismic resistance the provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for structural seismic resistance established primarily to reduce the risk of life loss or injury and will not necessarily prevent loss of life or injury or prevent earthquake damage to an existing building which complies with these standards this chapter shall not require existing electrical plumbing mechanical or fire safety systems to be altered unless they constitute a hazard to life or property c identification and classification this chapter provides systematic procedures and standards for identification and classification of unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings based on their present use priorities time periods and standards are also

or injury that may result from the effects of earthquakes on reinforced concrete and masonry wall buildings with flexible diaphragms designed under the building codes in effect before  these buildings are potentially hazardous and prone to significant damage including possible collapse in a moderate to major earthquake these structures typically shelter large numbers of persons and property for retail food markets food distribution centers warehousing aerospace industrialmanufacturing and general business and office use their continued use after an earthquake is also essential to the local economy and its postearthquake recovery the provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for structural seismic resistance established primarily to reduce the risk of loss of life or injury on both subject and adjacent properties and will not necessarily prevent all earthquake damage to an existing building which complies with these standards this chapter cannot require existing electrical plumbing mechanical or fire safety systems to be altered unless they constitute a hazard to life or property this chapter provides voluntary retrofit standards for deficient wall anchorage systems on
