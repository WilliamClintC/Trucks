recommendation of the plan commission for reason of flooding inadequate drainage adverse soil or rock formation unfavorable topography or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health safety or welfare of the future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community 2 the village board in applying the provisions of this shall in writing recite the particular facts upon which it bases its conclusion that the land is not suitable for residential commercial industrial or institutional use and afford the subdivider an opportunity to present evidence regarding such unsuitability if the subdivider so desires thereafter the village board may affirm modify or withdraw its determination of unsuitability b existing flora the subdivider shall make every effort to protect and retain all existing trees shrubbery vines and grasses not actually lying in public roadways drainageways building foundation sites private driveways soil absorption waste disposal areas paths and trails such trees are to be protected and preserved during construction in accordance with sound conservation practices possibly including the preservation of trees by well islands or retaining walls whenever abutting grades are altered pursuant to a landscaping plan filed by the subdivider  condominium developments a purpose 1 the village board hereby finds that certain issues arise in condominium developments that require limited applicability of this condominium developments the state legislature has recognized that subdivision ordinances may apply to condominiums but that subdivision ordinances shall not impose burdens upon condominiums that are different from those imposed on other property of a similar character not subject to a declaration of condominium 2 the factor that makes this to a condominium development is the creation of multiple distinct property entities at or near the ground surface subject to property taxation as separate parcels with each property entity having different ownership and management the village determines that this factor makes a condominium development dissimilar both physically and in ownership from developments in which the land and improvements are under unitary ownership management and control 3 thus the village board hereby finds that new condominium developments can place impacts on community resources in the same manner as other new developments that are characterized by division of land into lots these impacts include a additional population density b possibility of use of particular land in a manner unsuitable to the lands characteristics c additional demands upon village parks recreation areas utility facilities and schools d additional traffic and street use b portions of to condominium developments the following this apply to condominium developments 1 relating to land suitability and construction practices 2 relating to preliminary plat approval this stage of approval shall be the only approval

to highways wis stats  8603 tree planting and maintenance recommendations a planting 1 it is important to plant trees at the correct depth to avoid potential tree health problems trees should be planted with the top of their root crown at or slightly above the surrounding soil grade when planting bareroot trees the root crown is normally visible as the point where the topmost root emerges from the trunk however the root crowns of trees grown in containers or balled in burlap may be buried by nursery soil to determine where the top of the root crown occurs in these types of nursery stock you may need to dig into the nursery soil to locate this point the topmost root can normally be found within the top two inches of the containerroot ball once the top of the root crown has been located measure the vertical distance between the topmost root and the bottom of the container root ball or lowest root dig the hole about ten percent shallower than this depth and at least 15 times the diameter of the container root ball or root system the root ball should be positioned in the hole so the finished grade of the landscape soil is even with or slightly lower than the point where the topmost root emerges from the trunk 2 place the tree in the planting hole so that the trunk is vertical before backfilling be sure to remove all packaging materials from the root ball including containers burlap wire baskets or any other material that would impede the growth of the trees trunk or roots 3 be sure that when finished planting there is no landscape soil placed over the top of the root ball landscape soil as well as thick mulch layers more than three inches deep spread over the root ball can prevent water and air from entering the root ball b mulching weed and turf suppression during establishment is essential apply a threeinch thick layer after settling of mulch around the tree or shrub to help discourage weeds this area should be maintained during the establishment period at least two feet in diameter for each inch of tree trunk diameter avoid piling mulch directly against the trees trunk in order to keep the trunk dry and allow rainwater irrigation and air to easily enter the root ball c staking in many instances if root balls are heavy enough stakes are not necessary if it is necessary to stabilize a weak tree the tree should be staked in such a way as to allow for some trunk movement using a material that does not damage the trees bark all staking material should be removed within one year after planting d fertilization the application of fertilizer is not recommended during the establishment period approximately one year after planting for a oneinch caliper tree afterward a slow release or controlled release fertilizer can be applied on top of the root ball or mulch all fertilizer should be applied according to the directions on the product to avoid tree damage soluble fertilizers should be avoided on newly installed plants as they can burn roots or kill the tree entirely if too much is applied e irrigation recently transplanted trees and shrubs establish quickest with light frequent irrigation if rainfall is inadequate trees should receive supplemental irrigation to provide a total of at least oneinch of irrigation per week during the establishment period irrigation is most effective when performed during the early morning or evening to minimize evaporation from the soil surface consequently irrigating during this time also conserves water app a 10222007 approved trees in the

purpose of the a1 agriculturetransition district is to preserve for an unspecified time period in agricultural and related openspace land uses those lands generally located in proximity to developed areas within the village where urban expansion in inevitable and broadly in keeping with long time plans for development it is intended that urban development be deferred in such areas until the appropriate authorities concerned determine that it is economically and financially feasible to provide public services and facilities for uses other than those permitted in the district it is also intended that the status of all areas in this district be reviewed by the appropriate authorities periodically in order to determine whether in light of current land development trends there should be a transfer of all or any part of those areas to some other appropriate use district any such review will consider developments in keeping with the villages comprehensive plan b standards applicable to

one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed 20 feet whichever is greater except this limit may be exceeded and not be considered a substantial increase in the size of the tower if the exceedence is necessary to avoid interference with existing antennas  or b the mounting of the proposed antenna would involve the installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved not to exceed four or more than one new equipment shelter  or c the mounting of the proposed antenna would involve adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower more than 20 feet or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance whichever is greater except that the mounting or installation may be exceeded and not be considered a substantial increase in the size of the tower if necessary to shelter the antenna from inclement weather or to connect the antenna to the tower via cable  or d the mounting of the proposed antenna would involve excavation outside the current tower site defined as the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the tower and any access or utility easements currently related to the site 11 telecommunication facility any plant or equipment used to carry wireless telecommunications services by radio

would cause higher flood elevations  1112010 applicability the provisions of this to all areas within the flood storage district as shown on the official floodplain zoning maps  1112010 permitted uses any use or development which occurs in a flood storage district must meet the applicable requirements in  1112010 standards for development in flood storage districts a development in a flood storage district shall not cause an increase equal or greater than 001 of a foot in the height of the regional flood b no development shall be allowed that removes flood storage volume unless an equal volume of storage as defined by the predevelopment ground surface and the regional flood elevation shall be provided in the immediate area of the proposed development to compensate for the volume of storage which is lost compensatory storage excavation below the groundwater table is not considered to provide an equal volume of storage c if compensatory storage cannot be provided the area may not be developed unless the entire area zoned as flood storage districton this waterwayis rezoned to the floodfringe district this must include a revision to the floodplain study and map done for the waterway to revert to the higher regional flood discharge calculated without floodplain storage as per d no area may be removed from the flood storage district unless it can be shown that the area has been filled to the flood protection elevation and is contiguous to other lands lying outside of the floodplain  1112010 secs 6252762552  reserved division 6  nonconforming uses footnotes  6  editors
