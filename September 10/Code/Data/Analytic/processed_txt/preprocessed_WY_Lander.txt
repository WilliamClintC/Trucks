developments pud is intended to provide for the growing demand for housing of all types and designs and for necessary supportive commercial facilities conveniently located to such housing to create functional and attractive development to minimize adverse impacts and to ensure that projects will be assets to the community it is the purpose of this chapter a to promote and permit flexibility that will encourage innovative and imaginative approaches in land development and renewal which will result in a more efficient aesthetic desirable and economic use of land while maintaining density and intensity of use consistent with the applicable adopted plans regulations and policies of the city  b to promote development within the city that can be conveniently efficiently and economically served by existing municipal utilities and services or by their logical extension  c to promote design flexibility including placement of buildings use of open space pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems to and site and offstreet parking areas in a manner that will best utilize potential onsite characteristics such as topography geology geography size and proximity  d to provide for the preservation of historic or natural features where they are shown to be in the public interest including but not limited to such features as drainage ways flood plains existing topography or rock outcroppings unique areas of vegetation historic landmarks or structures  e to provide for compatibility with the area surrounding the project site  f to provide for usable and suitably located open space such as but not limited to bicycle paths playground areas courtyards tennis courts swimming pools planned gardens outdoor seating areas outdoor picnic areas and similar open space  g to minimize adverse environmental impacts of development  h to improve the design quality and character of new development 29 2 general  a planned unit development shall be consistent with the statement of purpose for planned unit development and the following criteria density  a the maximum gross density of the pud is based on the zone in which it is located actual gross density shall be computed by dividing the total acreage of the planned unit development by the number of dwelling units the density for portions of the pud may exceed the maximum gross density for the underlying zone as long as the maximum gross density for the entire pud does not exceed the maximum gross density allowed in that zone the net density of a particular phase of the pud shall be computed by dividing the acreage of the phase by the number of dwelling units the total acreage shall be that area contained in the planned development application and include all proposed streets common area public parks and dwelling sites and similar areas within the proposed development when such computation ends with more than 05 of a dwelling unit the maximum density will be increased to the next whole number  b the maximum density shall be based on the applicable zoning designation as follows zone maximum density r1 4 residential units per gross acre r2 10 residential units per gross acre r3 18 residential units per gross acre r5 44 residential units per gross acre for puds in the general commercial district the maximum density allowed would be the same as the r3 zone eighteen residential units per acre  c

chlorine  liquid chlorine shall be used only when suitable equipment is available and only under the direct supervision of a person familiar with the physiological chemical and physical properties of this element and who is properly trained and equipped to handle any emergency that may arise introduction of chlorine gas directly from the supply cylinder is unsafe and shall not be permitted note the preferred equipment consists of a solution feed chlorinator in combination with a booster pump for injecting the chlorinegas water mixture into the main to be sect 301  of 17 disinfected direct feed chlorinators are not recommended because their use is limited to situations where the water pressure is lower than the chlorine cylinder pressure 2 hypochlorites a calcium hypochlorite  calcium hypochlorite contains 70 percent 70% available chlorine by weight it is either granular or tabular in form the tablets 68 to the ounce are designed to dissolve slowly in water item g methods of

dose of chlorine also fed at a constant measured rate the two rates shall be proportioned so that the chlorine concentration in the water in the pipe is maintained at a minimum sect 301  of 17 of 25 mgl available chlorine to assure that this concentration is maintained the chlorine residual should be measured at regular intervals note in the absence of a meter the rate may be determined either by placing a pitot gage at the discharge or by measuring the time to fill a container of known volume table 2 below gives the amount of chlorine residual required for each 100 feet of pipe of various diameters solutions of one percent 1% chlorine may be prepared with sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite the latter solution required approximately one pound of calcium hypochlorite in 85 gallons of water b during the application of the chlorine valves shall be manipulated to prevent the treatment dosage from flowing back into the line supplying the water chlorine application shall not cease until the entire main is filled with the chlorine solution the chlorinated water shall be retained in the main for at least 24 hours during which time all valves and hydrants in the section treated shall be operated in order to disinfect the appurtenances at the end of this 24 hour period the treated water shall contain no less than 10 mgl chlorine throughout the length of the main table

distribution system or other approved source of sect 301  of 17 supply shall be made to flow at a constant measured rate item g methods of chlorine application para a note into the newlylaid pipeline the water shall receive a does of chlorine also fed at a constant measured rate the two rates shall be proportioned so that the concentration in the water entering the pipeline is maintained at no less than 100 mgl the chlorine shall be applied continuously and for a sufficient period to develop a solid column or slug of chlorinated water that will as it passes along the line expose all interior surfaces to a concentration of at least 50 mgl for at least three 3 hours the application shall be checked at a tap near the upstream end of the line by chlorine residual measurements b as chlorinated water flows tees and crosses related valves and hydrants shall be operated so as to disinfect appurtenances 3 tablet method  tablet disinfection is best suited to short extensions up to 2500 feet and smaller diameter mains up to 12 inches because the preliminary flushing step must be eliminated this method shall be used only when scrupulous cleanliness has been exercised it shall not be used if trench water or foreign material has entered the main or if the water is below 5 c 41f a placement of tablets  tablets are placed in each section of pipe and also in hydrants hydrant branches and other appurtenances they shall be attached by an adhesive except for the tablets placed in hydrants and in the joints between the pipe sections all the tablets within the main must be at the top of the main if the tablets are fastened before the pipe section is placed in the trench their position should be marked on the section to assure that there will be no rotation in placing tablets in joints they are either crushed and placed on the inside annular space or if the type of assembly does not permit they are rubbed like chalk on the butt ends of the sections to coat them with calcium hypochlorite the adhesive may be permatex no 1 a product of the permatex company brooklyn new york and kansas city kansas or any alternative approved by the engineer there shall be no adhesive on the tablet except on the broad side next to the surface to which the tablet is attached b filling and contact  when installation has been completed the main shall be filled with water at a velocity of less than onefootsecond this water shall remain in the pipe for at least 24 hours valves shall be manipulated so that the strong chlorine solution in the line being treated will not flow back into the line supplying the water sect 301  of 17 table 4 number of hypochlorite tablets of 5g required for dose of 25 mgl diameter of pipe in length of feet  2 4 6 8 10 12 13 or less 1 1 1 1 2 3

flushed from the main until the chlorine concentration in the water leaving the main is no higher than that generally prevailing in the system or less than one mgl chlorine residual determination shall be made to ascertain that the heavily chlorinated water has been removed from the pipeline i bacteriologic tests  1 after final flushing and before the water main is placed in service a sample or samples shall be collected from the end of the line and tested for bacteriologic quality and shall show the absence of coliform organisms if the number and frequency of samples is not prescribed by the public health authority having jurisdiction at least one sample shall be collected from chlorinated supplies where a chlorine residual is maintained throughout the new main note in case of extremely long mains it is desirable that samples be collected the length of the line as well as at its end 2 samples for bacteriologic analysis shall be collected in sterile bottles treated with sodium thiosulfate no hose or fire hydrant shall be used in collection of samples a suggested sampling tap consists of a standard corporation cock installed in the main with a copper tube gooseneck assembly after samples have been collected the gooseneck assembly may be removed and retained for future use j repetition of procedure  if the initial disinfection fails to produce satisfactory samples sect 301  of 17 disinfection shall be repeated until satisfactory samples have been obtained the tablet method cannot be used in these subsequent disinfections when the samples are satisfactory the main may be placed in service k procedure after cutting into or repairing existing mains  the procedures outlined in this section apply primarily when mains are wholly or partially dewatered leaks or breaks that are repaired with clamping device while the mains remain full of water under pressure present little danger or contamination and require no disinfection 1 trench treatment  when an old line is opened either by accident or by design the excavation will likely be wet and badly contaminated from nearby sewers liberal quantities of hypochlorite applied to open trench areas will lessen the danger from such pollution tablets have the advantage in such a situation because they dissolve slowly and continue to release hypochlorite as water is pumped from the excavation 2 main disinfection  a swabbing and flushing  the following procedure is considered as a minimum that may be used b swabbing with hypochlorite solution  the interior of all pipe and fittings used in making the repair particularly couplings and tapping sleeves shall be swabbed with a one percent 1% hypochlorite solution before they are installed c flushing  thorough flushing is the most practical means of removing contamination introduced during repairs if valving and hydrant locations permit flushing from both directions is recommended flushing shall be started as soon as the repairs are completed and continued until discolored water is eliminated d slug method  where practicable in addition to the procedures of paragraph 2 swabbing with hypochlorite solution a section of main in which the break is located shall be isolated all service connections shut off and the section flushed and chlorinated as described in item g methods of chlorine application paragraph b slug method except that the dose may be increased as much as 300 mgl and the contact time reduced to as little as fifteen 15 minutes after chlorination flushing shall be resumed and continued until discolored water is eliminated 3 sampling  bacteriologic sampling shall be taken after repairs to provide a record by which the effectiveness of the procedures used can be sect 301  of 17 determined

drainage system is necessary to reduce street maintenance costs to provide protection against regularly recurring damage from storm runoff to help create an orderly urban system and to provide convenience to the urban residents the initial drainage system cannot economically carry major runoffs though the major drainage system can provide for the initial runoff a well planned initial drainage system can reduce or eliminate the need for storm sewer systems storm sewer systems consisting of underground pipes are a part of initial storm drainage systems c major storm provisions  in addition to providing the storm drainage facilities for the initial storm runoff from an expected frequency of occurrence of once in five 5 years provisions shall be made to obviate major property damage and loss of life for the storm runoff expected to occur once each 100 years such provisions are known as the major drainage system d major drainage channels  open channels for transportation of major storm runoff are desirable in urban areas and use of such channels is encouraged open channel planning and design objectives are best met by using natural or naturaltype channels which characteristically have slow velocities and a large width to depth ratio natural water courses perhaps wet only during and after large rainstorms must not be filled or straightened significantly such actions tend to reduce storage and increase the velocity to the detriment of those downstream as well as those adjacent to the channel work effort must be made to reduce flood peaks and control erosion so that the natural channel regime is preserved as much as possible e design storm frequencies  storm drainage planning and design shall fully recognize the need for considering two separate

overtopping flow spread must leave at least one lane free of water in each direction when the above encroachment is indicated the storm sewer system shall be commenced designed on the basis of the initial storm development of the major drainage system is encouraged which can often drain off the initial runoff from the streets thus making the point at which the storm sewer system shall commence further downstream h irrigation ditches  irrigation ditches shall not be used as outfall points for initial or major drainage systems unless such use is shown to be without unreasonable hazard substantiated by adequate hydraulic engineering analysis 1 use of ditches  irrigation ditches areas are usually laid out on flat slopes and with limited carrying capacity it is obvious based on experience and hydraulic calculations that irrigation ditches cannot as a general rule be used as an outfall point for the initial storm drainage system because of physical limitations exceptions to the rule are when the capacity of the irrigation ditch is adequate to carry the normal ditch flow plus the initial storm runoff with adequate freeboard to obviate creating a hazard to those below the ditch 2 ditch perpetuation  irrigation ditches are sometimes abandoned in urban areas after the agricultural land is no longer farmed provisions must be made for ditch perpetuation prior to its being chosen and used as an outfall for urban drainage flexible pavements  flexible pavement shall consist of full depth asphaltic concrete or a combination of asphaltic concrete and granular base course
