increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater

can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development

the village protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers and telecommunications facilities  village of lindenhurst ny ecode360  352384 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 d e minimize adverse visual impacts of towers and telecommunications facilities design siting landscaping and innovative camouflaging techniques promote and encourage shared usecollocation of towers and antenna support structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional singleuse towers promote and encourage utilization of technological designs that will either eliminate or reduce the need for the erection of new tower structures to support antenna and telecommunications facilities avoid potential damage to property caused by towers and telecommunications facilities by ensuring that such structures are soundly and carefully designed constructed modified maintained and removed when no longer used or determined to be structurally unsound ensure that towers and telecommunications

of the suffolk county planning commission entitled smart communities growthapplying smart growth principles to suffolk county towns and villages hereinafter the county smart growth report principles of smart growth include encouraging mixed land uses and mixeduse buildings taking advantage of compact building sizes and creating a range of housing opportunities providing a variety of transportation choices and creating pleasant environments and attractive communities with respect to encouraging mixed land uses and mixeduse buildings the county smart growth report provides this activity will help create the density of development that is needed to sustain a healthy community by mixing compatible uses a walking community is created by having stores on the  village of lindenhurst ny ecode360  370384 c d e a b 1 2 3 f a first floor and residential uses on the second or third the base population is within walking distance of these uses   by providing many differing services in any given area local synergy is created and the need for people to drive to that area for any particular services or stores is diminished this will help reduce the use of the automobile   the concentration of uses in a tight knit area lends itself to leaving the car in one place   the alternative is to drive everywhere because of the separation of land uses that have been zoned compartmentalized and spread out each in its own location unrelated to the other with respect to taking advantage of compact building sizes and creating a range of housing opportunities the county smart growth report provides this action refers to allowing densities that are associated with traditional compact downtowns to be applied to residential and commercial development that occurs from new growth a framework provided zoning codes can allow higher densities which use land more wisely higher densities would be allowed in areas located within the existing infrastructure enabling residents to walk to shopping personal services community centers and transportation facilities   with respect to providing a variety of transportation choices the county smart growth report provides suffolk county is home to one of the nations most heavily used commuter railroads   transportation options might relieve suffolk countys roads of some automobile congestion   the county smart growth
