public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the township committee of the township of east greenwich gloucester county new jersey does ordain as follows 12 findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the township of east greenwich are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored causes damage in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss 13 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  streets  bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions 14 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  4 controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas 01114 1282009   definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be

trees applicants should exercise due care to protect trees to be retained from damage during construction the following procedures shall be observed in order to protect retained trees 1 protection from mechanical injury a prior to any grubbing or clearing all trees to be retained within twentyfive 25 feet of a building and all other improvements should be protected from equipment damage by enclosing the driplines of the trees with sections of snow fence or boards wired together all exposed roots and lowhanging branches should be equally protected groups of trees may be protected by fencing the driplines of the entire tree mass to be retained b heavy equipment operators should not damage existing tree trunks and roots feeder roots should not be cut closer than the distance of the dripline from the tree trunks and should be cut with pruning shears or other tools which will make a clean cut c tree trunks and exposed roots accidentally damaged during construction should be protected from further damage damaged branches should be sawed off at the branch collar no shellac or pruning paint should be used when the portion of the tree to be removed is diseased the pruning equipment should be dipped in alcohol or disinfectant prior to use on another tree to prevent the spread of the disease d deciduous trees should be given an application of liquid slowrelease lownitrogen allpurpose fertilizer to aid in their recovery from possible damage caused by construction operations such application should be made at a distance of one foot from the trunk to the dripline and should be made as soon as construction is completed and again one year after the first application has been made e trees should not be used for roping cables signs or fencing nails and spikes should not be driven into trees f the area around the base of existing trees should be left open to provide access for water and nutrients therefore neither impervious cover nor storage of equipment materials debris or fill should be allowed within the dripline of any existing tree to be retained 2 protection from grade change a if an increase of the grade is proposed the applicant should install either 1 a system of gravel and drain tiles at the old soil level opening into a dry well built around the trunk and designed for each tree individually fitting the contour of the land so that it drains water away from the tree trunk  or 2 a retaining wall between the existing grade and the higher grade a detailed plan for each proposed retaining wall should be provided b if a decrease of the grade is proposed the applicant should initiate one of the following methods to protect the trees 1 terracing the grade at the dripline and out from the tree 2 a retaining wall between the existing grade and the lower grade a detailed plan for each proposed retaining wall should be provided 3 protection from excavation when digging trenches for utility lines and other similar uses the applicant should adhere to the following listed in order of preference a if possible trenches should bypass the root area b if it is impossible for the trenches to bypass the root area trenches

create opportunities for planned commercial development in key locations in the route 295 growth corridor within the township the overlay is intended to provide the flexibility needed to accommodate a variety of uses while setting specific standards for design and ensuring that developments relate to their surroundings in a way that enhances the community even with a well conceived land use plan the timing of the development of individual parcels is often beyond the townships control while development will occur incrementally the b3 overlay will assist the township in setting the stage for a development program that will achieve the desired physical design standards improve the jobshousing balance bring services to the community and reduce the need for long commutes to shopping and service destinations the consolidation of smaller parcels to create larger developable tracts is encouraged throughout the overlay zone and the redevelopment area overall coordinated development

means a stream with a drainage area of fifty 50 acres or greater perennial stream means a stream that flows continuously throughout the year in most years stream means a natural watercourse containing flowing water for at least part of the year i art i part   purpose in addition the specific purposes and intent of this chapter are to a reduce the amount of nutrients sediment organic matter pesticides and other harmful substances that reach watercourses wetlands subsurface and surface water bodies by using scientifically proven processes including filtration deposition absorption adsorption plant uptake biodegradation denitrification and by improving infiltration encouraging sheet flow and stabilizing concentrated flows  b improve and maintain the safety reliability and adequacy of the water supply for domestic agricultural commercial industrial and recreational uses along with sustaining diverse populations of aquatic flora and fauna  c regulate the land use siting

width of twentyfive 25 feet measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the edge of water at bankfull flow where steep slopes in excess of twentyfive 25 percent are located within twentyfive 25 feet of a municipally designated watercourse zone one shall extend the entire distance of this sloped area if the distance of this sloped area is greater than seventyfive 75 feet there will be no requirement for the establishment of zone two if the distance is less than seventyfive 75 feet the width of zone two will be adjusted so that the total buffer width zone one and zone two will be seventyfive 75 feet maximum b zone two this zone will begin at the outer edge of zone one and occupy a minimum width of fifty 50 feet in addition to zone one where the one hundred 100 year floodplain extends greater than seventyfive 75 feet from the waterway zone one shall remain a minimum of twentyfive 25 feet wide and zone two shall extend from the outer edge of zone one to the outer edge of the
