is granted  and b that the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood  and c that the granting of a variance will not

the zoning board of appeals in writing over the signature of the chairman of the zoning board of appeals that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in greatly increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $25 per one hundred dollars $100 of insurance coverage  2 such construction below the base
