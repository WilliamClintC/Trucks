most equitable accurate and feasible method of ascertaining and measuring use of the facility and service of the city sewers and of designation of a charge of such use is by basing sanitary sewer service rates and charges on the quantity of water supplied to the premises of the respective sewer user may be achieved by establishing a minimum monthly sewer service charge and fixing the amount of the monthly sewer service charge at a stated percentage of the monthly water bill rendered to the same premises and that adoption of such method will effect substantial economic savings in preparing

to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safely and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council hereby adopts the following floodplain management chapter passed 42108  15702 findings of fact athe flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity and by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage passed 42108  15703 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by provisions designed to arestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity  brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters  dcontrol filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and eprevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other areas passed 42108  15704 objectives the objectives of this chapter are to aprotect human life and health  bminimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  cminimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  dminimize prolonged business interruptions  eminimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines  streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  fhelp maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard or other floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding  and gensure that potential home buyers are on notice that property is in a special flood hazard area hensure that those who occupy a special

criteria set forth in this subchapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners bit is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate passed 42108  15746 designation and duties of variance and appeal board athe mayor shall establish an appeal board pursuant to  15204 bduties of variance and appeals board 1the appeal board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this

15748 conditions for variances upon consideration of the factors listed above  and the purposes of this chapter the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter avariances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result bvariances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance cvariances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard in the instance of an historical structure a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure dvariances shall only be issued upon 1 a showing of good and sufficient cause  2a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant as defined in this chapter  and 3a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height additional threats to public safety cause extraordinary public expense create nuisance as defined in the definition section under public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization of the public as defined in the definition section or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances eany applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation fthe floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency fema and the federal insurance administration fia upon request gvariances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of  15747 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance passed 42108  15749 variance notification any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that athe issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates

recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county clerk and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land cthe floodplain
