trap for proper disposal reducing the grease entering the sanitary sewer system c interceptors usually are used for high volume full service restaurants generally serving more than 400 meals per day or large institutional food service production such as hotels hospitals and schools an interceptor is typically a vault 500 to 750 gallons that is located on the exterior of the building the vault contains two chambers with 90degree grease retention fittings and additional grease is collected as the wastewater cools and grease congeals on the surface of the water this grease is then removed

manhole meeting the industrial pretreatment program ipp manual specifications or other approved method of discharge sampling on at least a semiannual basis the city will conduct composite sampling on typically four consecutive days to determine the average concentration in mgl of conventional pollutants from each nondomestic user these user concentrations will be compared to the domestic background concentration for each parameter found under surcharge in the citys user charge report when the user concentration exceeds the domestic background concentration for a parameter the excess amount will be the concentration used to calculate the pounds to be surcharged the flow used shall be the actual monthly flow example the domestic background concentration for total phosphorus is 5 mgl user a has an user concentration of 8 mgl the surcharge concentration for user a would be 3 mgl this concentration multiplied by the monthly flow in millions of gallons  834 pounds per gallon gives the total pounds of phosphorus if user a consumed 600000 gallons of water that would be 06 million gallons  3 mgl  834   1501 pounds of surcharge phosphorus @ $251lb   $3767 for that month the excess concentration surcharge shall remain in effect until the next sampling sampling and analysis shall be performed by the city a split of each sample shall be made available to each user upon written request the city may obtain additional samples to verify a users effluent parameters any surcharged user may request additional samples based on a changed condition since the last sampling event costs for additional samples and analysis shall be paid by the user 2 nondomestic users without an approved sampling manhole or other approved method of discharge sampling that are food service establishments fses and do not require an industrial discharge permit may be surcharged according to the surcharge classification procedure established by the city this allows the city to levy surcharges to fses based on the specific type of service conducted ie full service restaurant fast food restaurant institutional food service grocery store with food preparation or baked goodsbakery by the user in lieu of individual waste sampling results users placed in a specific class of fse by the city may request individual surcharging based on actual sampling and analytical results as long as an adequate sampling manhole is provided and the user reimburses the city for sample collection time and materials and analytical expenses 3 each user subject to surcharges may be billed monthly or quarterly according to water usage or metered discharge c food service establishments that do not have sampling manholes the superintendent shall classify food service establishments fses based on type of food product customer consumption method and food preparation activities within the categories defined below the waste classification system shall determine how fses are surcharged 1 full service restaurants  definition this fse typically prepares and serves food in a dining setting attending patrons are provided food items served on plates with utensils that have to be washed after the patrons have completed their meals cookware is also cleaned on the premises food preparation comprises the many activities that constitute the provision of service at a full service establishment  baking frying grilling broiling boiling etc the overwhelming majority of service is provided in seating areas with a relatively small amount of carryout business 2 fast food restaurants  definition this fse prepares food intended for immediate consumption its food items are often provided in paper or other types of disposable wrappers and containers along with disposable utensils the patrons of

of the food service establishment usually work for or are contracted by the facility in which the food is served 4 grocery store with food preparation  definition this fse encompasses the various grocers delis and supermarkets that prepare food food preparation comprises the many activities that constitute the provision of service at a full service restaurant baking frying grilling broiling or boiling the patrons of these establishments buy food that is ready for consumption and they usually take the food items with them when they leave the establishment although some may have relatively small areas for patrons to consume food cookware and utensils are cleaned on the premises 5 baked goods or bakery  definition this fse typically prepares a variety of baked goods such as bread pastries and cakes for retail sale and for consumption by patrons who come to the establishment for baked goods for immediate consumption the area dedicated to serving walkin patrons is relatively small compared the total size of the facility with an equally small area dedicated to on premise consumption d standard fse wastewater strengths 1 standard fse wastewater strengths are established for

these standard fse wastewater strengths will be updated annually to reflect the results of ongoing sampling e surcharge rates 1 the superintendent shall assess a surcharge rate for each fse user based on the standard fse wastewater strength for that classification unless sampling is being conducted at the facility the established surcharge rate for each pollutant and domestic background concentration for each pollutant of concern is updated annually as part of the citys user charge report 2 surcharge amounts shall be determined for fses by determining the difference between the standard fse wastewater strength and the domestic background concentration for that pollutant the measured flow from the facility shall be applied to determine a cost per pound for each pollutant of concern a facility may choose to conduct site specific sampling if they believe the standard fse wastewater strengths listed do not adequately represent their discharge sampling procedures and frequency must be approved and are subject to oversight by the superintendent costs associated with such sampling and lab analysis would be the responsibility of the user surcharge calculations shall then be established by averaging grab or composite as determined by the city to be appropriate samples taken from the facilitys discharge f site specific testing 1 the owner of a fse may elect to have the industrial surcharge billed according to representative samples taken at the facility the fse 2018 s13 water and sewer rates 62a owner is required to pay for installation of a sampling point and all sampling costs sampling frequency shall be determined by the city and analytical results shall be submitted to the city for review 2 non domestic users that conduct site specific testing shall install an approved sampling manhole together with any meters and equipment deemed necessary by the superintendent or the city manager in order to adequately sample wastewater unrestricted access to the sampling manholes shall be available at all times for the superintendent a sampling manhole or chamber must be located near the outlet of each lateral sewer drain or pipe which connects to the wastewater system site inspections may be conducted by the city to verify the users discharge and note the presence of any sampling devices or grease traps 88 title ii ch 22   passed 111780  am passed
