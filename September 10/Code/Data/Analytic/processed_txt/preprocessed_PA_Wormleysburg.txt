impact study may be performed in lieu of a comprehensive study when such trip reduction measures are used to justify performance of an abbreviated study as permitted by this section a developer and successors shall be bound by a recorded agreement to implement such measures the terms and form of agreement shall be as mutually agreed upon by the borough and the developers 3 in addition a comprehensive traffic impact study shall be prepared at the discretion of the borough whenever either of the following conditions exists within the impact study area a current traffic problems exist in the local area or neighborhood including but not limited to a high crash location confusing intersection or a congested intersection that directly affects access to the development b the ability of the existing roadway system to handle increased traffic or the feasibility of improving the roadway system to handle increased traffic is limited b traffic impact study requirements 1 area of traffic impact study the traffic impact study area shall be based on the characteristics of the surrounding area the intersections to be included in the study shall be adjacent to the site or have direct impact upon the access to the site the intersections shall be mutually agreed upon by the borough and the transportation engineer preparing the study if a highway occupancy permit hop is involved include all intersections from any penndot scoping meeting 2 preparation by transportation engineer required traffic impact studies shall be prepared by or under the supervision of qualified and experienced transportation engineers licensed and registered to practice in the commonwealth of pennsylvania with specific training in traffic and transportation engineering and at least two 2 years of experience related to preparing traffic studies for existing or proposed developments 3 horizon year the traffic forecasts shall be prepared for the anticipated opening year of the development assuming full build out and occupancy this year shall be referred to as the horizon year 4 nonsite traffic estimates estimates of nonsite traffic shall be made and will consist of nonmotorized traffic and motorized and nonmotorized traffic generated by all other developments within the study area for which preliminary or final plans have been approved nonsite traffic may be estimated using any one of the following three 3 methods buildup technique area transportation plan data or modeled volumes and trends or growth rates 5 trip generation rates required the traffic impact study shall include a table showing the land use categories and quantities with the corresponding trip generation rates or equations with wormleysburg borough zoning  part 725 general regulations wormleysburg borough zoning  wormleysburg borough zoning draft   part 7 justification for selection of one or the other and resulting number of trips the trip generation rates used must be either from the latest edition of trip generation by ite or from a local study of corresponding land uses and quantities all sources must be referenced in the study 6 consideration of passby trips if passby trips or shared trips are a major consideration for the land use in question ite studies should be referenced and interviews should be conducted and documented at similar land uses 7 rate sums any significant difference between the sums of singleuse rates and proposed mixeduse estimates must be justified and explained in the study 8 explanations required the reasoning and data used in developing a trip generation rate for specialunusual generators must be discussed and agreed upon with the borough prior to using 9 definition of influence area prior to trip distribution of sitegenerated trips an influence area must be defined which contains eighty 80 percent or more of the trip ends that will be attracted to the development a market study can be used to establish the limits of an influence area if available if no market study is available an influence area should be estimated based on a reasonable documented estimate the influence area can also be based on a reasonable maximum convenient travel time to the site or delineating area boundaries based on locations of competing developments other methods such as using trip data from an existing development with similar characteristics or using an existing origindestination survey of trips within the area can be used in place of the influence area to delineate the boundaries of the impact 10 estimates of trip distribution required trip distribution can be estimated using any one of the following three 3 methods a analogy b trip distribution model c surrogate data whichever method is used trip distribution must be estimated and analyzed for the horizon year a mixeduse development may require more than one distribution and coinciding assignment for each phase for example residential and retail phases on the same site consideration must also be given to whether inbound and outbound trips will have similar distributions 11 trip assignments assignments must be made considering logical routings available roadway capacities left turns at critical intersections and projected and perceived minimum travel times in addition multiple paths should often be assigned between origins and destinations to achieve realistic estimates rather than assigning all of the trips to the route with the shortest travel time the assignments must be carried external site access points and in large projects those producing five hundred 500 or more additional peak direction trips to or from the site during the developments peak hour internal roadways when the site has more than one 1 access drive or driveway logical routing and possible multiple paths should be used to obtain realistic access drive or driveway volumes the assignment should reflect conditions at the time of the analysis assignments can be accomplished either manually or with applicable computer models wormleysburg borough zoning  part 726 general regulations wormleysburg borough zoning  wormleysburg borough zoning draft   part 7 if a thorough analysis is required to account for passby trips the following procedure should be used a determine the percentage of passby trips in the total trips generated b estimate a trip distribution for the passby trips c perform two 2 separate trip assignments based on the new and passby trip distributions d combine the passby and new trip assignment upon completion of the initial site traffic assignment the results should be reviewed to see if the volumes appear logical given characteristics of the road system and trip distribution adjustments should be made if the initial results do not appear to be logical or reasonable 12 total traffic impacts motorized and nonmotorized traffic estimates for any site with current traffic activity must reflect not only new traffic associated with the sites redevelopment but also the trips subtracted from the traffic stream because of the removal of a land use the traffic impact study should clearly depict the total traffic estimate and its components 13 capacity analysis capacity analysis must be performed at each of the major street and project site access intersection locations signalized and unsignalized within the study area in addition analyses must be completed for roadway segments deemed sensitive to site traffic within the study area as determined by the borough these may include such segments as weaving sections ramps internal site roadways parking facility access points and reservoirs for vehicles queuing on and offsite other locations may be deemed appropriate depending on the situation the recommended levelofservice analysis procedures detailed in the most recent edition of the highway capacity manual must be followed the operational analyses in the highway capacity manual should be used for analyzing existing conditions traffic impacts access requirements or other future conditions for which traffic geometric and control parameters can be established 14 turn lane warrant analysis conduct turn lane warrant analysis at all unsignalized intersections in accordance with current penndot methodology 15 required levelsofservice the recommendations of the traffic impact study shall provide safe and efficient movement of traffic to and from and within and past the proposed development while minimizing the impact to nonsite trips the current levelsofservice must be maintained if they are

example 1 if an existing business office included five 5 existing parking spaces but would be required to provide ten 10 spaces via this there is a deficit of five 5 spaces therefore if that business office is proposed to be converted to a retail business that would need fifteen 15 spaces the proposed retail business would need to provide a total of ten 10 spaces 15 minus the preexisting deficit of 5 b when the intensity andor density of any existing structure or use is increased by not more than ten 10 percent in the applicable measurement eg dwelling units gross floor area seating capacity lot area impervious lot coverage or other units of measurement specified in this  for required parking and loading facilities and the applicant proves to the zoning officer that there is insufficient area on the lot to meet the required amount of parking or loading then no additional parking or loading shall be required example 2 if an existing building included two thousand five hundred 2500 square feet and a minor addition of two hundred fifty 250 square feet to the existing building was proposed then additional parking would not be required 3 no parking or loading facility shall be used
