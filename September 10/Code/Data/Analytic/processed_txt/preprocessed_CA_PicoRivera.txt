the ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted as an urgency measure pursuant to government for the immediate preservation of the public health safety and welfare and is adopted and justified based on the following findings of the city council in addition to the recitals referenced above which are true and correct and incorporated fully herein a the city council hereby finds that to promote the health safety and welfare restrictions on sidewalk vending are necessary to avoid negative impacts on the health safety and welfare of the resident including but not limited to the following 1 proliferation of illegal sales  2 potential public exposure to foodborne illnesses due to unlicensed vendors and unsanitary conditions  3 increase in trash and debris in public rightsofway  4 overcrowded sidewalks impacting safe pedestrian movement  5 interference to the performance of police firefighter and emergency medical personnel  6 disruption to the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic including ingress or egress from any residence public building place of business or from the street to the sidewalk by persons exiting or entering parked or standing vehicles  7 mitigate negative impacts to the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic including ingress into or egress from any residence public building or place of business or from the street to the sidewalk by persons exiting or entering parked or standing vehicles  8 provide reasonable access for the use and maintenance of sidewalks pathways poles posts traffic signs or signals hydrants restrooms trash receptacles firefighting apparatus mailboxes as well as access to locations used for public transportation services  9 maximize public access to and along the rightofway  10 reduce exposure to legal liability to the city due to personal injury or claims for damage and litigation due to use of public property  and 11 protect adult and minor residents from vendors with certain criminal history and background b the city council further finds that the unique characteristics of the city require certain area specific restrictions on sidewalk vending as follows 1 pico rivera sports arena the pico rivera memorial sports arena is a multipurpose arena with an approximately six thousand seat capacity that is used for concerts rodeos wrestling boxing circus and other similar events sports arena the sports arena is located at 11003 rooks road pico rivera california 906 which is located adjacent to on or near arterial roadways and is adjacent to the interstate 605 freeway a tenlane freeway on days of events there is a heavy vehicular and pedestrian traffic on the adjacent public rightsofway before during and after events based on the physical characteristics of the sidewalks adjacent to the sports arena the presence of vendors on sidewalks and pedestrian paths within areas adjacent to the sports arena before during and after events would obstruct such sidewalks and cause potentially dangerous vehicular conditions causing risk to sidewalk vendors pedestrians and motorists who utilize the streets and sidewalks in areas adjacent to the sports arena in order to protect and preserve the general public welfare and safety the city council determines that it is necessary to prohibit sidewalk vending two hours before during and two hours after events at the sports arena  2 the civic center contains the citys emergency operation center the pico rivera sheriffs station and other critical infrastructure and equipment vending restrictions are necessary to ensure that public safety apparatuses are readily accessible and critical infrastructure is maintained and accessible at all times  3 restrictions on sidewalk vending at in or around parks is necessary to protect the health safety and general welfare of those persons engaged in active parks and sports activities as well as spectators of sporting events and park activities  4 many of the sidewalks and pathways in the city are under eight feet wide and sidewalk vending in these areas unreasonably interfere with the flow of pedestrians and disrupt the access for persons with disabilities or decrease safety for users of the citys sidewalks  and 5 due to the close interaction between sidewalk vendors and seniors children and residents generally the restrictions placed on sidewalk vending are intended to protect the health safety and general welfare of the public therefore criminal history investigations are necessary to protect the general public  2019  definitions for the purpose of this chapter the words terms and

very prone to be activated by current failures or other events having no connection with criminal activity and tie up such emergency phones making them unavailable to receive genuine emergency calls c

enacting the ordinance codified in this section to improve the quality of life and economic vitality of the city and to protect the safety of the general public against certain abusive conduct of persons engaged in aggressive panhandling by imposing reasonable restrictions on aggressive intrusive or unsafe panhandling while respecting the constitutional rights of free speech for all citizens 2 aggressive and intrusive panhandling typically includes approaching or following pedestrians the use of abusive language unwanted physical contact or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic the city council finds that an increase in aggressive and intrusive panhandling in the city has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses and has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places but also in certain circumstances to an enhanced sense of fear and disorder aggressive panhandling unquestionably threatens the publics safety and welfare aggressive panhandling also undermines the publics inherent right to use and enjoy public places without being accosted by or be in reasonable apprehension of persons demanding money or goods in a forceful manner the actions of individuals engaged in aggressive panhandling likewise can create a climate of intimidation and anxiety among members of the public who when confronted reasonably and legitimately fear harm if they refuse to give in to the solicitations of individuals engaged in this type of conduct 3 aggressive panhandling usually includes approaching or following pedestrians the use of abusive language unwanted physical contact or the intentional blocking of pedestrians the city council further finds that the presence of individuals who panhandle from persons at or near banks or automated teller machines and similar retail financial businesses in parking lots at transit stops and in certain other public locations is especially threatening and dangerous such activity often carries with it an implicit threat to both person and property 4 the city council further finds as abusive the panhandling of people in places where they are a captive audience in which it is impossible or difficult for them to exercise their own right to decline to listen to or to avoid panhandling from others such places include parking lots and structures transit stops and outdoor dining areas aggressive and targeted panhandling of commercial customers as they enter and exit retail stores restaurants bars and cafes has become increasingly disturbing to residents and business and threatens the economic vitality of the city restricting panhandling in such locations will provide a balance between the rights of those panhandling and the rights of persons who wish to decline or avoid such panhandling and will help avoid or diminish the threat of violence in such unwarranted and unavoidable confrontations the city council further finds that the presence of individuals who panhandle for money from persons at or near banks or automated teller machines is especially threatening and dangerous such activity often carries with it an implicit threat to both person and property restricting panhandling in such places will provide a balance between the rights of panhandlers and the rights of persons who wish to decline or avoid such panhandlings and will help avoid or diminish the threat of violence in such unwarranted and unavoidable confrontations 5 the city council has considered evidence presented to it concerning the safety of individuals standing on median islands who have directed their activities at persons traveling in vehicles on city streets and the secondary effects of those activities on traffic moving vehicles andor those persons who were in moving vehicles panhandling on roadway median strips at traffic intersections and in the public roadway increases the risk of drivers becoming distracted from their primary duty to watch traffic which may result in automobile accidents congestion and blockage of streets and delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel all of which constitute substantial traffic safety problems 6 the city council finds that soliciting on medians presents safety hazards to the persons on the median islands traffic congestion interference with passage on public streets and other safety impacts which result from the conduct occurring on or near the median islands and not from the content or viewpoint of any such speech activity in which any of them may be engaged 7 the city council declares that its intent in enacting this ordinance is not to interfere with the exercise of first amendment rights of those lingering loitering or soliciting on the medians but only to minimize the safety hazards of those in the median islands as well as the drivers of vehicles in a particular place and manner which minimizes those safety hazards 8 the city council further finds that the practice of panhandling near driveways accessing shopping centers retail and business establishments is unsafe and hazardous for panhandlers drivers pedestrians and the general public the location of the panhandler near the driveway compromises the panhandlers safety impedes visibility and impairs a drivers ability to safely enter and exit drivers also become distracted from their duty to watch traffic which may result in automobile accidents congestion and blockage of streets and delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel all of which constitute substantial traffic safety problems 9 the restrictions contained herein are neither overbroad nor vague and are narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest furthermore in enacting this legislation the council recognizes the availability of warnings community service or other sentencing alternatives which may be appropriate remedies for violations of this law b definitions for purposes of this section 1

the increased volume of sewage generated by such development detailed studies and findings of this fact are contained in the sanitary sewer system study prepared by the city engineer and on file in the office of the city engineer b the purpose of this chapter is to establish a charge to be collected from the owners of such properties proposing to discharge to the public sewer quantities of sewage in excess of the quantity for which the existing sewerage system was designed and to establish a fund into which these charges may be deposited and from which money will be available for the

section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of pico rivera to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  1998  appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury

facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in substantially increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder of the county of los angeles and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency  1998  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result c variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood haz ard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council body believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance d variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in of this chapter to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in of this chapter see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in of this chapter of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances e variances may be issued for new construction and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsection a of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance f upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  1998 small residential rooftop solar energy systems  purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote and encourage the use of solar energy

located within a 193acre parcel  and 4 an existing commercial retail use located on a 028acre at the corner of washington and rosemead boulevards should be retained and any future commercial use should be consistent with the requirements and standards outlined in this specific plan b design concepts 1 density transitions density increases should be transitioned from the streetscape to ensure that the scale of the development is compatible with the neighborhood streetscape new development should be consistent in density and form with existing specific plan area 2 respect setbacks residential infill on vacant parcels should respect existing setbacks along the streetscape 3 design compatibility new infill developments should be designed to be compatible with surrounding development so as to enhance and not detract from the character of the existing neighborhood 4 bungalow theme residential development should combine aspects of a contemporary planned development with aspects of neighborhoods established in california during the early decades of the twentieth century the architectural style of the california craftsman bungalow should be used as the model for development due to its inherent attractiveness informality elegance and compatibility with contemporary housing  1996  singlefamily development standards a density standards the maximum density

currently cities and counties are required to divert fifty percent of all solid waste by  reduction recycling and composting activities this diversion of solid waste requires the cooperation of the residential commercial industrial and public sectors b the california solid waste reuse and recycling access act of 1991 act identified lack of adequate areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials that are compatible with surrounding land uses as a significant impediment to diverting solid waste and constitutes an urgent need for state and local agencies to address access to solid waste for source reduction recycling and composting activities the act further required each local agency to adopt an ordinance relating to adequate areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials in development projects this chapter has been developed to meet that requirement  1994  definitions the following definitions shall apply to the language contained in this chapter a

in february 2003 to reflect a request for an additional 184294 square feet in subarea b and 85372 square feet in subarea c revisions to the document were made throughout changing the amendment number from 4003 to 4004 and to accommodate the changes in square footages please be aware that the remaining language of the document was left intact and may not reflect current development conditions for example the site is no longer occupied by the northrop grumman corporation the city of pico rivera initiated the preparation of the rancho de bartolo specific plan in 1996 to provide a comprehensive set of guidelines regulations and implementation programs to guide the future redevelopment of the 200 gross acre site currently occupied by northropgrumman in addition the 35acre area located to the south of the northropgrumman plant site occupied by the burlington northern santa fe bn&sf rail yard was included in the planning area governed by the rancho de bartolo specific plan11 the primary objective of the rancho de bartolo specific plan is to ensure that the future redevelopment of this area mirrors the land use and development objectives outlined in the citys general plan while providing maximum flexibility to facilitate the sites timely reuse a comprehensive planning program was undertaken to identify possible development scenarios that should be considered as part of the sites planning and development four different development scenarios emerged from this initial planning process that were ultimately included in the specific plan12 the four development scenarios considered in the original rancho de bartolo specific plan included the following 1 the aerospace retention alternative provided for the adaptive reuse of the existing plant facilities  2 the mixeduse alternative contemplated the sites redevelopment in industrial research and development distributionrelated uses and a mix of retail office industrial and manufacturing uses  3 the theme park alternative permitted a wide range of resort and recreational amenities for the planning area  and 4 the megamall alternative provided for the development of a regional commercial shopping center within the planning area over the course of planning and development that occurred since the specific plans initial adoption the mixeduse scenario emerged as the development that was ultimately selected for implementation the focus of this amendment specific plan amendment 4003 updated in february 2003 by amendment 4004 to the rancho de bartolo specific plan referred to hereinafter as the amendment is to provide further guidance concerning the commercial retail development currently proposed within those portions of the planning area located along washington boulevard and the light manufacturing and distributionrelated land uses within the remainder of the planning area unlike the development contemplated under the rancho de bartolo specific plan formal development applications have been submitted to the city of pico rivera indicating the location extent and mix of land uses13 the purpose of this amendment then is to accomplish the following 1 to consider the current development proposals conformity with the standards and guiding principles outlined in the adopted rancho de bartolo specific plan  2 to address the additional floor area and other entitlements being requested in the conditional use permit applications  3 to revisit the previouslyadopted mitigation measures and mitigation monitoring program included in the original specific plans environmental impact report eir to determine their relevance to the current development proposal  4 to update the information included in the adopted rancho de bartolo specific plan  and 5 to determine if any

original adopted rancho de bartolo specific plan the key elements of the current development concept include the following 1 a total of 629000 square feet of commercial uses were proposed within subarea a square footage will not change under amendment 4004 2 a total of 1911800 square feet of manufacturing light industrial and distribution uses was permitted under the previous amendment 4003 under amendment 4004 a total of 184294 additional square feet is permitted 3 a total of 885600 square feet of industrial uses is permitted within subarea c the adopted rancho de bartolo specific plan provided for 717800 square feet of floor area for this subarea the additional floor area permitted within this subarea was approved previous development intensity transfer from subarea b and the specific plan amendment under amendment 4004 an additional 85372 square feet is permitted over the 885600 square feet 4 no changes are contemplated for subarea d while the current development concept considered in this amendment provides for additional floor area over that proposed in the original specific plan the impacts of this future development will be less for several reasons first the original mixeduse scenario contained land uses that would represent significant traffic generation offices hotels etc secondly the heavy industrial uses proposed in the original specific plan contemplated specialized manufacturing activities instead of the light industrial research and development and distribution uses that are currently proposed table 25 provides a breakdown of the current development proposal as indicated within table 25 the development intensities and uses correspond to and are consistent with the overall land use guidelines outlined previously a total of 629000 square feet of commercial uses and 2096094 square feet of industrialdistribution uses are currently being proposed over subsequent phases of planning additional modifications to the concept plan identified in table 25 are likely to ensure conformance with the specific plan these future changes are addressed in table 25 land use distribution of proposed applications bldg no land use floor

standards and regulations contained in this section are adhered to a definition of a minor modification to this specific plan is provided in footnotes 21 the far standard used in this specific plan is simply the ratio of the gross floor area of development permitted within each subarea to the net area of the subarea a far of 05 to 10 for example implies that the total floor area of permitted development within a particular subarea is half of the total land area of the subarea 30 urban design plan 31 urban design concepts and criteria the design standards and guidelines contained herein have been established to further promote quality and attractive development to ensure land use compatibility and to provide guidance with regard to building mass and form architectural styling color and materials and landscape design future development within the planning area must conform to the overall design concept established herein andor within any future conditional use permit requirements this design concept will integrate the various uses contemplated under the specific plan new development must be designed to be compatible so as not to detract from the character of other development abundant landscaping must be provided along the perimeter of the planning area and along the interior roadways landscaping within the parking areas and along the roadways within the planning area will be used to soften the overall appearance of development criteria discussed in this section focuses on design requirements standards and guidelines unique to the various types of development envisioned under the rancho de bartolo specific plan this section of the rancho de bartolo specific plan considers the following 1 design criteria for the commercial institutional manufacturing and other types of development  2 development standards for future land uses  3 design standards applicable to the entire planning area  and 4 additional landscaping design standards applicable to the current development proposal 32 urban design criteria this section indicates the design criteria that apply to development permitted within the planning area pursuant to the land use plan contained herein in this section of the urban design plan discusses design guidelines that will provide a coordinated selection of landscaping and paving materials while emphasizing important architectural elements individuality as well as cohesion between various development types permitted in the planning area will be strengthened implementation of the design criteria contained herein in addition the overall project identity and character will be further defined and enhanced by the continuity of landscape materials along publiclyvisible areas the landscape plan will define an overall framework identifying streetscape design and a plant palette for the perimeter areas interior roadways major entries and the nodes the identity of individual areas may be established in landscaping at major entry points along smaller streets within the project and within individual open space areas the development of the overall project character and the individual parcels is controlled and restricted by these guidelines as well as by applicable governmental codes and regulations the individual parcel owners in coordination with their architects will implement all provisions applicable to their specific site development by adherence to these guidelines and the conditions of approval as noted in any future conditional use permit table 31 indicates design criteria and guidelines for the major categories of development table 31 urban design criteria commercial development office development industrial development singlestory and multistory elements a combination of one and twostory elements should be created within the overall form of commercial buildings in order to provide a variety of scale and reduce the perceived building mass any building mass above the second story should be set back and reduced in size massing should be simple and possess strongly integrated geometric forms the massing should relate to the internal function and nature of the space it is intended to enclose a combination of one and twostory elements may be created within the overall form of commercial buildings in order to provide a variety of scale and reduce the perceived building mass perimeter mass the portions of the buildings adjacent to pedestrian corridors and walkways shall be stepped down with the use of subelements to create a more human scale for pedestrians varying the wall plane in depth andor direction will create a more human scale for pedestrians on the portions of the buildings adjacent to pedestrian corridors walkways varying the wall plane variation in the siting of structures so they are offset and variable setbacks will be used to promote the development of a campuslike setting the use of pedestrianfriendly design treatments street furniture outdoor cafs kiosks and other amenities must be incorporated into the design barrierless perimeters are encouraged to promote a campuslike setting the use of landscaped yards areas parkways and berms are encouraged the use of landscaped yard areas parkways and berms are required to provide separation between structures commercial development office development industrial development building faades the faades of commercial retailing uses should clearly identify the entry and provide clear directions to patrons office uses should have strong contrast between the solid mass of faade and the lighter elements of the glazing and entry industrial buildings should have strong contrast between the solid mass of faade and the lighter elements of the glazing and entry the exterior of the commercial uses must avoid using blank or solid walls in those areas adjacent to the pedestrian walkways or those areas facing washington rosemead and paramount boulevards the faade should clearly identify the entry and direct people to it also the creation of strong shadow lines via recessed features and projections is strongly encouraged the faades should clearly identify the entry and direct people towards it blank walls along the front elevations should be avoided articulation the apparent mass of buildings should be reduced by means of articulation ie the varying of wall planes in depth andor direction onesided architecture where only the dominant street frontage possesses articulation should be augmented by using elements such as window treatments and trellises on the other visuallyexposed elevations the apparent mass of buildings will be reduced by means of articulation in the front elevations this articulation creates visual interest and humanscale outdoor spaces such as patios and terraces large blank singleplaned walls are not permitted any loading areas must be screened from view to maintain a campuslike setting use of architectural elements elements such as canopies awnings porches arcades and balconies may be used to add wall articulation and provide a varied transition of building mass from ground level to roof office building design should incorporate a simple unified architectural treatment or style that provides a framework for storefronts and signage building design should incorporate a simple unified architectural treatment or style that provides a framework for the character of the business park and the basis for the necessary signage program commercial development office development industrial development the overall architecture should be compatible with that used in the remainder of the subarea development building entrances entrances should be oriented toward walkways to maximize pedestrian circulation for example this can be done by recessing storefront entrances that open onto pedestrian thoroughfares the main public entrance should be readily visible from the parking area or pedestrian connection architectural elements such as a portecochere framework or skylight may be used to emphasize the entrylobby areas entrances should be oriented toward walkways and the parkways to maximize pedestrian circulation ground floor interest commercial retail buildings should be designed so that the ground floor presents an interesting and varied appearance to pedestrians and motorists using windows arcades architectural detailing artwork and similar design features to bring a more human scale to pedestrians design solutions should emphasize color texture and other treatments that provide visual interest specific elements that may generate this interest include colonnades awnings windows and enriched design details building should be designed so that the ground floor presents an interesting and varied appearance number of materials the number and variety of materials on commercial buildings should establish harmony and visual continuity trellises frameworks wood or tile details artwork and other features are encouraged as design features on otherwise blank walls one dominant material should be selected and expressed with its own natural integrity use of materials that convey permanence substance timelessness and restraint are encouraged one dominant material should be selected and expressed with its own natural integrity for the front elevations visible from the primary and secondary roadways commercial development office development industrial development roof materials materials must be fireresistant such as clay or concrete tile on pitched roofs and composition materials on flat roofs roof equipment must be concealed from groundlevel views materials must be fireresistant such as clay or concrete tile or architectural composition shingles on pitched roofs and composition materials on flat roofs all roofing materials must be fireresistant standingseam metal roofs may also be used if city staff determines that such a roof is consistent with the character and style of the building roof equipment air conditioning units vents etc must be concealed from groundlevel views standingseam metal roofs may also be used if city staff determines that such a roof is consistent with the character and style of the building standingseam metal roofs may also be used if city staff determines that such a roof is consistent with the character and style of the building acceptable wall materials stucco wood masonry river rock veneer or other durable highquality materials may be used proven steps to protect and preserve such materials are encouraged to retain and ensure an attractive appearance over time dominant wall materials that will usually comprise over 70 percent of total wall surface and secondary materials that cover the remainder and serve as accents or to emphasize entry focal points should be used dominant materials include stucco brick splitfaced or other decorative block glass nonreflective wood and textured concrete secondary materials may include any dominant material listed above metal tile plaster glass block and stone dominant wall materials that will usually comprise over 70 percent of total wall surface and secondary materials that cover the remainder and serve as accents or to emphasize entry focal points should be used dominant materials for the front elevation may include stucco brick splitfaced or other decorative block glass wood and textured concrete secondary materials may include any dominant material listed above metal tile plaster glass block and stone commercial development office development industrial development wall colors and color accents one dominant color should be used for the building walls although subdued colors such as beige tan cream sand light gray etc usually work best as the dominant wall color bolder colors may be used if city staff determines they are consistent with the character of the project surrounding properties andor the streetscape glass should not be used over more than 70 percent of the wall surface per elevation to allow for human scale elements along the lower levels colors of dominant material should generally be subdued or earthtone shades eg gray offwhite tan beige and similar and relatively light wall surfaces should be embellished by means of texturing the use of exposed aggregate fenestration wall openings such as doors and windows variations in wall color insets and overhangs to create shadow lines and similar design features to add interest and relief also where possible material with integral color such as brick should be left natural secondary material colors should complement and be a tasteful accent to the dominant material color color palettes should be kept simple with one dominant color per building and accent colors on doors window surrounds address numbers light fixtures and architectural details such as cornices and soffits colors of dominant material should generally be subdued or earthtone shades eg gray offwhite tan beige and similar and relatively light secondary material colors should complement and be a tasteful accent to the dominant material color 33 urban design standards this section of the specific plan indicates development standards for those land use

design the purpose of this subsection is to highlight guidelines and principles pertaining to urban design related to future redevelopment within the planning area the previous sections outlined the specific design requirements to future development in addition to the aforementioned standards applicable to future development the following requirements apply 1 commercial development design future commercial development permitted within subarea a must be integrated in terms of design and pedestrian access commercial structures located within the outlying pads must be compatible in architectural style and design with the primary structures 2 commercial drivethru lanes the location and orientation of drivethru lanes must be designed so that the drivethru lanes are not visible or sufficiently screened from washington boulevard all order boards and speakers must be oriented away from washington boulevard these lanes may be concealed using landscaping decorative walls or other design elements 3 commercial building articulation building articulation measures must be utilized to prevent the appearance of blank walls along those elevations visible to the general public the use of windows wall treatments awnings and other design elements may be used to avoid the creation of blank walls the primary focus of this issue is related to the northfacing elevations of the commercial development permitted in subarea a 4 pedestrian activity the commercial development within subarea a must be designed to promote pedestrian circulation this may be accommodated creative use of street furniture walkway treatments canopies and other amenities designed to encourage pedestrian activity 5 signage a signage plan must be submitted to the city for approval no pole signs will be permitted guidelines regarding signage are provided in  entries entryway design treatments must be provided at the key nodes and entryways as shown in the original rancho de bartolo specific plan these major

required for all fencing not identified on the development plans submitted as part of the cup application 35 design standards and guidelines the design standards and guidelines described in this section are applicable to the entire planning area the guidelines focus on those key design elements that will promote a pleasing and comfortable environment to those working in andor patronizing future development within the planning area  overview of urban design concepts the use of focal points will provide both orientation and organization these focal points create a visual counterpoint to the massing of nearby buildings there are four major entries crossway drive danbridge street rex roadeast entrance and rex roadwest entrance noted in exhibit 31 all four major entries are located at the entrances to the planning area from the adjacent public arterial roadways these entries shall be grand entries that reflect the quality and uniqueness of the project elements of these entries will include but not be limited to special paving areas for visual and auditory experience  large dominant trees and plant material  and monument signage to establish project identity opportunities for major project identification are located at the corners of washington and rosemead boulevards and washington and paramount boulevards as well as in a number of key locations within the planning area potential elements of these nodes could include special paving distinctive plant material arcades raised planters fountainswater features sign monument and outdoor art these nodes provide the opportunity for dominant project identification statements in addition the design of the prominent corners shall take into consideration the architectural elements of the adjoining parcel depending on the use of the adjacent parcel the site planning and architecture of the building could integrate the design of the project identification node to further enhance the quality and urban design of the project for example landscaping decorative walls or monuments may be incorporated into the design of those businesses located at the washingtonparamount and the washingtonrosemead intersections the definition and corresponding guidelines for the key design elements are described below 1 entryway nodes entryway nodes refer to those special design treatments that will be provided at the major entryways at rex road both the east and west entrances danbridge street and crossway drive 2 internal nodes elements included in the nodes will incorporate some of the plant material from the major entries for continuity and consistency and as visually recognizable gateways into the project or parcels within the project 3 courtyards and patios courtyards and patios are encouraged to add

3 screening techniques to enhance the appearance of the streetscape within the planning area screening techniques such as berming and landscape planting shall be used to screen parking areas from prominent visual corridors landscape treatment shall also be used to screen utility fixtures and equipment  parking loading storage area and refuse storage standards given the nature of permitted uses exterior loading and storage areas will be required to serve future development the use of open space within the designated yard andor setback areas for storage and loading will not be permitted to ensure that visual quality within the planning area will be maintained the following guidelines apply to those activities and uses requiring areas for loading and storage 1 all materials supplies or equipment including trucks or other motor vehicles shall be stored onsite inside a closed building or behind a visual barrier to screen such materials supplies or vehicles from adjacent sites so they are not visible from neighboring properties and streets 2 provisions shall be made on each site for any necessary vehicle loading no onstreet vehicle loading shall be permitted loading dock areas

incorporated into these monument signs no other feestanding signs of any type will be permitted  utilities communication devices exterior electrical equipment and transformers specialized equipment and mechanical devices may detract from the overall appearance of future development in the absence of design measures that will be effective in screening or concealing this equipmentmachinery from view the following standards related to utilities are applicable to the planning area 1 all exterior onsite utilities including but not limited to storm drain infrastructure sewers gas lines water lines and electrical telephone and communications wires and equipment will be installed and maintained underground antennae or other devices for transmission or reception of signals including but not limited to telephone television and radio should be screened from public roadways and adjacent structures wireless telecommunications equipment monopoles must conform to city regulations as well as those requirements included in the rancho de bartolo specific plan 2 onsite underground utilities should be designed and installed so as to minimize the disruption of offsite utilities paving and

compressors motors incinerators ovens etc shall be screened from view from public roadways and adjacent structures building parapets shall be of such a height that roofmounted screening devices are not required if building parapets do not provide the required screening mechanical equipment should be screened by an unobtrusive screening device that will appear as an integrated part of the overall architectural design 8 any devices employed to screen exterior components of plumbing processing heating cooling and ventilating systems from direct view should appear as an integrated part of the architectural design and as such should be constructed of complementary and durable materials and finished in a texture and color scheme complementary to the overall architectural design  lighting standards the creative use of lighting equipment as a means to enhance the appearance of nighttime views will be promoted implementation of this specific plan amendment future development will require security lighting along walkways in parking areas and along the internal roadways the following standards will be followed 1 exterior building materials and the onsite lighting plan shall be reviewed by the zoning administrator to minimize the potential for light and glare impacts 2 the site lighting plan for the exterior parking areas shall be designed to direct all light sources downward and onto the site outdoor lighting shall be designed and installed so that all direct illumination is confined to the site and adjacent properties are protected from spillover illumination 3 lowwattage security lighting directed away from lightsensitive uses shall be utilized and shall be shielded to prevent spillover and glare 4 street lights must be consistent with the development in terms of scale and design and their height should not exceed 25 feet 5 the creative use of building security lighting will be required in all subareas ground lighting fixtures directed upwards along exterior walls may also serve as effective illumination 6 groundmounted lighting shall be installed in the landscaped medians entryways and activity nodes as a means to enhance these features during the nighttime periods 7 the use of decorative lighting treatments in landscaping pedestrian activity areas and nodes and entryways will be encouraged these treatments may also be incorporated into the overall architectural design of the future buildings  landscaping concept the highquality environment envisioned for the planning area will be established in part by the landscaping treatment the landscaping is intended to give structure and identity to the overall project by creating continuity in plant material and streetscape design the landscaping theme will establish a framework starting from the exterior of the site the major perimeter arterials major entries and project identification nodes to the interior of the site the internal collectors and individual parcels the plant palette and landscape treatment for each of the streets serve to reinforce the overall concept the focus of the landscaping plan is to provide a combination of evergreen and deciduous plantings to promote variety in tree shapes and sizes the landscaping concept also promotes the abundant use of landscaping and plantings along the roadways parkway areas and in the yard areas the landscaping concept reflects the hierarchy of the street system with taller trees defining the major arterials and mediumsized trees denoting the more local street network other key elements of the landscaping concept include the following 1 linear berms are proposed throughout the project perimeter these berms are intended to further enhance the landscape character of the planning area and are designed to create topographic variation and interest on an otherwise flat site shrubs ground cover and turf areas will articulate the ground planes these streetscape elements will collectively yield coherence structure and identity 2 the major arterials at the perimeter of the planting area are critical to the identity and the character of the project it is envisioned that washington rosemead and paramount boulevards will have a sufficient number of mature trees to reinforce a campuslike atmosphere a  continuous turf berm shall be a landscape element consistent with all major perimeter arterials these

improvements required to serve the development permitted under this rancho de bartolo specific plan and the plan amendments the following guiding principles were considered in the formulation of the specific plan and this amendment sp 4004 1 the circulation system and infrastructure required to serve future development must be designed to minimize the traffic impacts from this development 2 the infrastructure required to serve future development must be designed and programmed to accommodate future growth and demand 3 the circulation plan must facilitate the safe and efficient movement of persons and goods and promote the use of public transit in the area this section of the rancho de bartolo specific plan amendment consists of the following elements 1 circulation criteria indicate the location and extent of roadways contemplated as part of future development within the planning area 2 traffic and circulation development standards indicate those guidelines and standards related to construction of future roadways 3 utilities and service development standards indicate development standards related to utilities and services that will be required to fully serve future development 42 circulation criteria and guiding principles the conceptual circulation plan illustrated in exhibit 41 is designed to facilitate the efficient movement of people and goods throughout the planning area the circulation system described herein is designed to accommodate the broad land use mix being contemplated as part of the current development proposal however some minor modifications to the circulation framework may be required as development progresses the roadways and other facilities designed to serve future development in the planning area must conform to standards contained herein primary roadways identified herein will move traffic planning area and connect with nearby major arterial roadways rosemead boulevard paramount boulevard and washington boulevard other secondary roadways will facilitate internal circulation throughout the planning area in addition to providing for internal circulation planning area these roadways provide connections to the adjacent arterial roadway network rosemead washington and paramount boulevards the following circulation system elements are considered herein along with the applicable standards 1 primary roadway the minimum curbtocurb pavement width for this category of roadway must be 64 feet a total of four travel lanes shall be provided with a minimum lane width of 12 feet and a minimum total rightofway width of 72 feet two roadways are included in this category rex road and the crossway drive entrance to subarea a crosssections of this roadway classification are provided in exhibit 42 2 secondary roadway secondary entries serve the internal roadways connecting to subareas b and c the minimum curbtocurb width of these roadways is 40 feet with a total rightofway width of 56 feet crosssections of this roadway are provided in exhibit 42 3 drivewayaisles all driveways connecting to an arterial roadway and secondary roadway must have a minimum width of 40 feet 4 parkway sidewalks a minimum 4foot wide sidewalk must be provided on at least one side of the roadway landscaping must separate the sidewalk from the roadway 5 curb cuts the number of curb cuts along the washington boulevard frontage must be kept to a minimum no more than four curb cuts will be permitted along the washington boulevard frontage the limitation does not include the main entry at crossway drive no curb cuts will be permitted within 400 feet of the rosemeadwashington boulevard intersection 6 egress all egress points at unsignalized driveways and intersections will be restricted to rightturning movements 7 rightturn pocket an existing rightturn pocket in the southbound lanes of rosemead boulevard at rex road must be maintained as a means to prevent vehicle stacking associated with the use of the railroad spur crossing rex road near rosemead boulevard 8 driveway aisle the driveway aisle configuration near the westerly paramount boulevard and easterly rosemead boulevard entrances must be designed to prevent vehicle queuing that may result in the blockage of these driveways the medians shown in the conceptual site plan may be further extended to eliminate stacking problems 9 drivethru lanes all drivethru lanes for the restaurants banks and other commercial uses must not interfere with the circulation within the public rightsofway 10 onstreet parking no onstreet parking will be permitted within the designated primary and secondary roadways 11 direct internal access between subareas a and b the extension of crossway drive will serve as a limited use driveway connection to the rear loading areas of the commercial establishments located in subarea a no trucks will be permitted to use this driveway barriers subject to the zoning administrators approval will be incorporated into the project design to ensure this condition is maintained 12 employee parkingdeliveries employee parking and deliveries to subarea as commercial uses excluding the outlying pads will be restricted to the southfacing elevations 43 utilities and public services this section outlines the requisite water sewage flood control facilities that will be required to accommodate proposed development envisioned under this specific plan amendment given the demands required to accommodate the previous northropgrumman plant which consisted of approximately 39 million square feet limited improvements are required to serve the current proposal the proposed infrastructure shown in the exhibits provided herein will accommodate the individual buildings and development currently planned  water facilities the planning area is bordered by water facilities belonging to three different water agencies pico water district has an 8inch pipeline in the north side of washington boulevard and another 8inch line in the east side of rosemead boulevard also in the east side of rosemead boulevard is a 10inch line belonging to the santa fe springs water company the city of pico rivera water department has a 17inch line in the south side of washington boulevard a 12inch pipeline in the west side of paramount boulevard and a 17inch line in the west side of rosemead boulevard which only extends southerly from washington boulevard into subarea a this 17inch line in washington boulevard is fed directly by a well located just westerly of paramount boulevard three main water connections from these city lines currently serve the planning area a 10inch service exists on the west side of the site at rex road a 12inch service feeds from the north and another 12inch line serves the easterly portion of the planning area the existing water system adequately served the northropgrumman facility when it was in full production when the facility was operating at full capacity it used about 25 percent of the annual 6000 acrefeet of water pumped by the city this equates to a demand of approximately 930 gallons per minute gpm the existing water system is sufficient to accommodate the development contemplated under this amendment without additional offsite improvements however if future development includes any highwater usage industries such as bottling plants the water demands of such industries should be estimated combined with the demands of the entire development and compared with the above figures to ensure continued water system adequacy exhibit 43 illustrates the water facilities existing and proposed that will serve the project  sewer facilities sewer service currently exists along the west side of paramount boulevard the analysis of the potential service demand requirements for the development scenarios provided for under the rancho de bartolo specific plan indicated that there is adequate capacity to serve future development the main sewer line located adjacent to the planning area is a 63inch trunk line in paramount boulevard this line which is operated by the county sanitation districts of los angeles county has three direct connections in the area the first connection is a 10inch public line in washington boulevard that extends easterly the other two connections are private lines one of these is a 15inch line located north of rex road extending easterly into the site and the other is a 10inch line extending easterly in rex road the wastewater generated from future development would be conveyed aforementioned 63inch trunk line and treated at the los coyotes water reclamation plant in the city of cerritos andor at the joint water pollution control plant in the city of carson according to the districts the design capacity of the 63inch trunk line is 594 million gallons per day mgd the latest measured peak flow of the trunk line in 1994 is 452 mgd information provided by the districts indicates that in 199 the combined sanitary and industrial waste flows from the northropgrumman facility totaled approximately 026 mgd based on the previous figures estimated for the previous development any future increase would raise the peak flow of the trunk line by 133 percent to approximately 458 mgd which is still far below the design capacity also either of the potential treatment facilities has enough additional capacity to accommodate the increased flow generated by this project therefore no additional offsite sewer improvements should be required to accommodate the future development contemplated under this specific plan amendment however it should be noted that as with the water facilities this analysis should be reviewed if future development includes any highwater usage industries exhibit 44 illustrates the existing and proposed sewer facilities  storm drain facilities significant storm drain facilities currently exist both within and adjacent to the planning area a 27inch reinforced concrete pipe rcp conveys flows from north of washington boulevard to an open channel located on the west side of rosemead boulevard this channel then continues in a southerly direction in the easterly portion of the planning area where it outlets to a double 72inch rcp at that point there is a confluence with an existing 66inch rcp that extends northerly to rex road and an existing 72inch rcp that extends westerly the 66inch rcp feeds a network of onsite drainage facilities the planning area is considered to be fully developed as such the existing storm drain facilities are capable of conveying the developed condition storm flows generated onsite due to the fact that future development permitted under this specific plan amendment also represents a developed condition it is assumed that the existing drainage facilities will be capable of conveying these flows as well as a result the existing major storm drain facilities are adequate to properly drain the planning area following redevelopment the existing backbone facilities ie concrete channel large diameter rcps etc should therefore remain in place and be utilized by future development however some modifications outlined in exhibit 45 may be required to accommodate future development in addition onsite infrastructure and connections may need upgrading depending on the uses ultimately selected  infrastructure requirements future development shall coordinate the provision and installation of offsite facilities with service providers needed to provide adequate water service to the site 1 development plans shall be submitted to the los angeles county sanitation districts to determine the required water system improvements 2 fire flow requirements for public and private hydrants shall be provided in accordance with los angeles county fire department standards 3 onsite sewer lines and connections shall be provided in accordance with city requirements and accepted engineering standards 4 the city shall approve a landscaping plan that utilizes droughttolerant plants and provides waterefficient irrigation systems ie drip irrigation automatic shutoffs soil moisture sensors automatic controllers and

appliances and equipment and an onsite leak detection program 6 all applicable sections of titles 20 and 24 of the california regulations regarding water consumption and conservation shall be enforced 7 irrigation systems that minimize runoff and evaporation and maximize water availability to plant roots shall be required dripline irrigation soil moisture sensors and automatic irrigation systems are acceptable watersaving irrigation methods 8 adequate storm drain facilities shall be constructed prior to the occupancy of the proposed project in accordance with future development 9 onsite activities shall comply with stormwater quality management requirements of the city and county under npdes permit no ca0061654 with appropriate permits prior to connection with the county drainage system this may include implementation measures designed to reduce the quantity of street pollutants that enter the local storm drainage system both during construction and after permanent facilities have been built 10 temporary erosion control devices shall be installed as required by the state regional water quality control board to mitigate potential impacts on groundwater qualities  power utilities and energy conservation the following standards are concerned with the provision of energy to the planning area natural gas and electric utility purveyors and the attendant need for energy conservation 1 the developer shall work with southern california edison sce and southern california gas company scg in abandoning existing overhead power lines and gas lines new and existing utility lines shall be installed underground sce and scg will facilitate the extension andor relocation of power and gas lines and facilities that will serve future development within the planning area 2 the developer shall work with telephone and cable television companies in abandoning existing overhead lines and undergrounding all new telephone and cable lines that will serve future development 3 all proposed structures onsite shall adhere to state and city standards regarding energy conservation insulation and energyefficient site planning design and appliance use energy conservation practices shall be incorporated into the project and the use of energyefficient or gas air conditioning systems and appliances will be required 4 design measures that maximize the use of climate and reduce heating and cooling requirements will also be incorporated into future development all proposed structures onsite shall adhere to state and city standards on energy conservation insulation and energyefficient site planning design and appliance use  solid waste disposal future occupants will be encouraged to implement waste recycling practices for paper cardboard glass plastics metals green waste and other recyclable materials at the project site and the project shall comply with the citys recycling and source reduction programs in compliance with ab 939 50 implementation program 51 adoption of the specific plan amendment the adoption of and provisions of the specific plan amendment are not intended to have application to subarea c without the express written consent of the owners thereof subject to the foregoing this amendment to the rancho de bartolo specific plan will serve as the primary regulatory document for the planning area the consistent application of the standards contained in this specific plan will ensure that the planning areas development reflects the communitys overall vision for the planning area while providing a maximum amount of flexibility for the property owner the adoption of the rancho de bartolo specific plan amendment sp 4004 as an amendment to the city of pico rivera zoning provide policy consistency and legal status equal to other zoning requirements this specific plan amendment does not nullify those provisions andor regulations contained in the original rancho de bartolo specific plan or the previously adopted amendments not addressed in this specific plan amendment notwithstanding any other provision of this specific plan amendment none of the provisions of this amendment are intended to or will apply to subarea c without the express written consent of the owner of the 40 acres designated as subarea c in the specific plan 4003 amendment during the term of the development agreement 98273 between the city and pico rivera business center i llc as amended or as it may be amended from time to time these 40 acres shall remain subject only to the provisions of the specific plan as previously adopted and amended 52 actions required for implementation of the amendment the pico rivera zoning already been amended to reflect a specific plan sp zone to encompass this planning area the city of pico rivera general plan has also been amended to reflect this specific plan finally an ordinance has been adopted to establish the specific plan area the primary objective of the original rancho de bartolo specific plan and this specific plan amendment is to provide clear and consistent direction regarding the future development of the 235 gross acre planning area both the original plan and this amendment were formulated to provide maximum flexibility to better accommodate future development however both the plan and this amendment provide a clear definition as to the communitys overall vision for the planning areas development the original plan identified four broad and very different development scenarios that would be permitted within the planning area and one of these scenarios ultimately emerged as the candidate for additional consideration the guiding principles and standards contained in the original rancho de bartolo specific plan are a direct outgrowth of the large number of community workshops study sessions and public hearings held during the specific plans development and public review as a result these earlier standards guidelines and guiding principles serve as the foundation for this specific plan amendment given the size of the planning area and the complexity of the current development concepts and site plans additional staff review and other discretionary review will be required this review will consists of the following steps step 1 the city may consider and approve a master conditional use permit mcup for all or a portion of the future development contemplated within the planning area this approval may only be considered as long as the mcup application is deemed complete and in conformance to city requirements by city staff step 2 recognizing that additional design and site plan details are likely to be unresolved with the approval of a master conditional use permit additional detail site plans andor alternative designs may be required as part of the conditional use permit process such information andor plans are to be reviewed by the zoning administrator and a determination made by that individual as to the submittals conformity to the specific plans regulation and intent should the applicant disagree with the zoning administrators determination then the determinationdecision may be appealed to the planning commission pursuant to the procedures outlined in the city of pico rivera municipal environmental impact report eir prepared for the original rancho de bartolo specific plan and the mitigated negative declaration prepared for this plan amendment will provide the requisite environmental review for the aforementioned actions in the event that revisions or modifications are made to the site plan andor development concept and these changes andor revisions are deemed not to be minor revisions then additional environmental review may be required 53 specific plan review approval and minor revisions plan review procedures for development within the planning area are intended to shorten the processing time for the applicant the developer will be required to file final site plans for development with the planning area governed by the rancho de bartolo specific plan in accordance with the procedures established in the citys conditional use permit andor precise plan of design review process an environmental impact report eir was prepared as part of the specific plans original review and adoption the development that is to occur implementation of this specific plan was evaluated fully in the eir this mitigated negative declaration provided herein in indicates the conformity of amendment sp 4003 along with the current development proposal sp 4004 with that development originally contemplated in the adopted rancho de bartolo specific plan the nature and extent of any further environmental review will depend on the nature of future plan amendments the standards contained herein also reflect mitigation that has been recommended as part of the previous eirs preparation as well as the mitigation contained in the mitigated negative declaration51 minor revisions to the land use and development provisions contained herein will not require further amendments to the rancho de bartolo specific plan minor revisions include those activities that would normally be subject to a categorical exemption pursuant to the california environmental quality act other minor revisions will include building footprint adjustments minor changes in floor area revisions to the location of structures and other modifications to the site plan the determination as to whether any future changes to the development plan constitute a minor revision shall be left to the discretion of the community development director changes to the site plan andor the proposed development concept are not considered to be a minor revision if any of the following conditions are met 1 the site plan revisions andor changes to the development concept involve an increase in floor area exceeding the maximum permitted in of this specific plan amendment  2 the site plan revisions andor changes to the development concept require a modification to the standards regulations andor guiding principles outlined in this specific plan amendment  3 the site plan revisions andor changes to the development concept involve land uses andor development not identified as being permitted within of the specific plan  and 4 the site plan revisions andor changes to the development concept involve changes that
