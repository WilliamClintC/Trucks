machines and selfservice displays prohibited nuisance enforcement  findings the common council of the city of brookfield finds that athe purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health safety and welfare of the property and persons in the city by prohibiting persons under eighteen 18 years of age from possessing electronic smoking devices and prohibiting the sale of electronic smoking devices to persons under eighteen 18 years of age  and bpersons under age eighteen 18 are prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing cigarettes and other tobacco products and retailers are prohibited from selling them to minors there are new tobaccoless products however commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes ecigarettes ecigars ecigarillos epipes ehookahs or electronic nicotine delivery systems which allow the user to simulate cigarette smoking these products may be purchased by minors and are being marketed without age restrictions or health warnings and come in different flavors that appeal to young people  and cthe production and distribution of electronic smoking devices is not currently regulated by federal or state authorities and the us food and drug administration fda has not completed testing of these products but initial studies by the fda have determined that electronic smoking devices can increase nicotine addiction among young people and contain chemical ingredients known to be harmful which may expose users and the public to potential health risks  and dthe use of electronic smoking devices has increased significantly in recent years as evidenced by the fact that 1between 2017 and 201 ecigarette use rose from eleven and seventenths 117 percent to twenty and eighttenths 208 percent among high school students and from three and threetenths 33 percent to four and ninetenths 49 percent among middle school students  2in 2017 to 201 sixtyseven and eighttenths 678 percent of current youth ecigarette users cited the availability of appealing flavors as the primary reason for use  3in 201 more than three million 3000000 middle and high school students were current users of ecigarettes and ecigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco products among youth  and eexisting studies on electronic smoking devices vapor emissions and cartridge contents have found a number of dangerous substances including 1chemicals known to cause cancer such as formaldehyde acetaldehyde lead nickel and chromium  2pm 25 acrolein tin toluene and aluminum which are associated with a range of negative health effects such as skin eye and respiratory irritation neurological effects damage to reproductive systems and even premature death from heart attacks and stroke  and fsome cartridges used by electronic smoking devices can be refilled with liquid nicotine solution creating the potential for exposure to dangerous concentrations of nicotine  and ga study published in the journal of environmental and public health suggests that electronic smoking devices may have the capacity to renormalize tobacco use in a demographic that has had significant denormalization of tobacco use previously  and helectronic smoking devices often mimic conventional tobacco products in shape size and color with the user exhaling a smokelike vapor similar in appearance to the exhaled smoke from cigarettes and other conventional tobacco products  and ithe purported health benefits from electronic smoking devices have not been scientifically proven and use of these devices has not been proven safe either for their users or for bystanders more than one study has concluded that exposure to vapor from electronic smoking devices may cause passive or secondhand vapor inhalation clinical studies about the safety and efficacy of electronic smoking devices have not been submitted to the fda for the more than four hundred 400 brands of electronic smoking devices that are on the market and consumers have no knowledge of whether electronic smoking devices are safe  what types of concentration of potentially harmful chemicals the products contain  and what dose of nicotine the products deliver the world health organization has strongly advised consumers against the use of electronic smoking devices until they are deemed safe and effective and of acceptable quality by a competent national regulatory body the world medical association has determined that electronic smoking devices are not comparable to scientifically proven methods of smoking cessation and that neither their value as therapeutic aids for smoking cessation nor their safety as cigarette replacements is established  and jresearch indicates electronic smoking devices may lead youth to try tobacco products in addition research indicates that youth who use electronic smoking devices are more likely to use tobacco products including cigarettes than those youth who do not use electronic smoking devices  and kelectronic smoking devices are currently unregulated and have been proven to emit nicotine ultrafine particles volatile organic compounds and other toxins inhalation of nicotine is proven to be dangerous to everyone especially children and pregnant women exposure to ultrafine particles may exacerbate respiratory illnesses such as asthma and may constrict arteries which could trigger a heart attack the volatile organic compounds such as formaldehyde and benzene found in electronic smoking device aerosols are proven carcinogens  and lthe use of electronic smoking devices in smokefree locations threatens to undermine compliance with smoking regulations and reverse the progress that has been made in establishing a social norm that smoking is not permitted in public places and places of employment  and ma harvard university health study found high levels of diacetyl in thirtynine 39 of fiftyone 51 unique flavors of chemicals used in electronic smoking devices diacetyl is associated with bronchiolitis obliterans and other severe respiratory diseases among workers who have inhaled heated vapors containing diacetyl  and nexisting studies on electronic smoking devices vapor emissions and cartridge contents have found a number of dangerous substances including carcinogens such as formaldehyde acetaldehyde lead nickel and chromium  pm 25 acrolein tin toluene and aluminum which are associated with

prison were four times more likely to be rearrested for a sex crime as compared to nonsex offenders released from prison of those individuals included in the study forty 40 percent of new sex crimes committed by those sex offenders released from prison had occurred within the first twelve 12 months of release further child molesters who were released from prison were at least six times more likely to be rearrested for another sex crime against a child as compared to a nonsex offender released from prison dwhereas the common council has conducted a review of other reports and studies

treatment 27 1 1633 ewhereas the common council acknowledges that literature on sex offender recidivism sex offender desistance and sex offender residency restrictions contains studies which report varying effectiveness of certain strategies the common council intends to use these strategies and studies to best create a regulatory framework which protects the children of the city of brookfield hereafter city yet allows for a constructive and safe assimilation of designated sex offenders into the community fthe common council finds that the risk of recidivism decreases over time from the date of the last conviction especially in circumstances where offenders have community connections goals and employment the common council is also aware that absent a domicile clause the city would have open doors for nonresident sex offender residency when other communities have closed doors inviting a substantial increase in child sex offender placements thereby increasing potential negative impacts on the health safety welfare and additional cost to the city and its residents studies show increased recidivism rates for offenders who frequently move or do not have established community networks these studies support maintaining a domicile clause thereby limiting designated offenders with no ties to the community and increasing the likelihood that a designated offender implements appropriate and existing community support while allowing the community to remain intelligently attentive aware and provide adequate and appropriate intervention if needed gaccordingly the common council has created this regulatory measure designed to protect the health and safety of the children in the city against the threat posed by certain designated sex offenders sex offenders who prey on children represent a substantial danger to victims target a particularly vulnerable group within the community who are less able to articulate or report abuse and create a significant impact on law enforcement time and community resources to investigate abuses and mitigate risks this chapter is also intended to demonstrate the citys resolute goal of protecting children in areas of potential vulnerability and impart the communitys confidence by demonstrating safe productive and lawabiding behavior while residing within the city it is the intent of the common council that this regulatory scheme is civil and nonpunitive in order to serve the citys compelling interest to promote protect and improve the health safety and welfare of all citizens of the city part 2019  definitions as used

property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production  2there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable

however that where such streams contain a significant amount of a pollutant and the combination of such streams prior to treatment with an industrial users regulated process wastestreams will result in a substantial reduction of that pollutant the city upon application of the industrial user may exercise its discretion to determine whether such streams should be classified as diluted or unregulated in its application to the city the industrial user must provide engineering production sampling and analysis and such other information so that the city can make its determination  or bsanitary wastestreams where such streams are not regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard  or cprocess wastestreams which were exempted from categorical pretreatment standards from one or more of the following reasons ithe pollutants of concern are not detectable in the effluent from the industrial user  iithe pollutants of concern are present only in trace amounts and are neither causing nor likely to cause toxic effects  iiithe pollutants of concern are present in amounts too small to be effectively reduced by technologies known to the administrator of epa  or ivthe

specific zoning overlay areas  statement of purpose the purpose of the modified suburban overlay district is to supersede certain provisions of base zoning in certain areas when other available zoning tools or other techniques cannot achieve desired results with standards to protect unique development building or land use patterns in residential commercial or mixeduse areas when such patterns are not adequately addressed by applicable zoning regulations  promote reinvestment and redevelopment in residential commercial or mixeduse areas where change is desired and when existing zoning regulations hinder achievement of the desired change  or help implement neighborhood plans or planning studies   part 1999  overlay district in relation to other zoning each modified suburban overlay district may be used to relax or eliminate requirements of the base zoning districts or to impose additional requirements than those stated in the base zoning district where conflict occurs among two or more overlay districts applicable to the same property the most restrictive of the conflicting provisions prevails   part 2000 part 1999  overlay district requirements whenever this overlay district is applied to a particular geographic area the common council will adopt a map or map series showing the geographic extent of the overlay district the zoning issue area planning unit and any parcels within each overlay zoning district the associated map is considered a supplement document adopted and incorporated herein by reference the common council will also set forth the permitted uses if different than the base zoning and particular standards for each overlay district  the standards may include but are not limited to the size scale and height of buildings hours of operation traffic control noise control lighting odor control impervious surface coverage and landscaping adevelopment patterns new development and redevelopment of properties designated as having a development pattern of new suburban ns cluster suburban cs combination csns residential cluster rc context suburban cts or traditional neighborhood development tnd will be required to achieve the following design characteristics summarized here and described more specifically for each geographical area 1 cluster suburban a development pattern where buildings are positioned and clustered on a site in a manner that creates a welldefined pedestrian environment between building entrances minimal parking is located in the area between the building cluster and the street a maximum of a doublerow of parking cluster suburban acknowledges that most people will drive in their autos to destinations but will seek to walk between buildings in the cluster area the development style minimizes the autooriented environment along the street and configures buildings to encourage pedestrian usage the streetside and pedestrianside building facades convey human scale articulation detailing or landscape plantings 2 new suburban a development pattern where buildings are oriented toward the street with at least one major pedestrian entrance connected to the streetpedestrian way no parking is located in the area between the building and the street a welldefined pedestrian environment is developed between the edge of the street and the streetside facade of the building while most people will drive their autos to destinations in a new suburban development greater opportunities for pedestrian access to sites will be created the streetside building facade conveys human scale articulation detailing or landscape plantings 3 residential cluster a residential development pattern characterized by a unified site design for a number of housing units clustering buildings and providing common open space potential density increases and a mix of building types it permits the planning of a project and the calculation of densities over the entire development rather than on an individual lotbylot basis where sites with this development pattern are adjacent to sites planned for a new suburban or cluster suburban development pattern street yard building setbacks shall approximate those called for in those development pattern standards 4 context suburban cts a development pattern in which development or redevelopment on a parcel that is within a neighborhood context of relatively newer or historic buildings may develop consistent with the building layout and parking layout of the neighborhood context 5 traditional neighborhood development tnd a development pattern consisting of a compact mixeduse neighborhood where residential commercial and civic buildings are in close proximity to each other as defined in 1c wisconsin statutes this development pattern is created by title only to indicate intent of the city to conform with the requirements of the state law the development pattern may be able to be achieved under one or more of the other development patterns defined in this section or additional development pattern provisions may be incorporated by later amendments consulting with a document identified as model traditional neighborhood development dated december 200 published by the university of wisconsin  extension pursuant to 2 wisconsin statutes as a nonexclusive and nonbinding guide to the form of development 6 combined development patterns where properties are designated in the matrix found in the following having a combination of development patterns the plan commission will allow a combination of patterns within a single site or within a planning unit as defined herein 7 standards for the removal of a development pattern designation the plan commission may after finding that a development pattern designated in a matrix for the nonresidential use of a specific property does not serve in the best interests of the community due to the proximity of the residential properties and the existence of certain conditions including but not limited to topography lot size lot depth or the impact of a permitted intensive use on adjacent residential properties recommend that the common council remove the development pattern designation amendment to the matrix and removal or amendment of the associated map as needed b dimensional standards 1 as necessary the development pattern designations will require site plans with dimensional characteristics different than those required by the underlying base zoning the application of this overlay district constitutes authorization to the plan commission to modify dimensional requirements of underlying base zoning to achieve the purposes and the intent of the development patterns the following set of illustrations shows how such modifications may be made to achieve certain standards of the development patterns a building setbacks from streets for new suburban development twentyfive 25 foot1 minimum to seventy 70 foot maximum setback along a street for new suburban frontage where a single building is located on an individual lot where building clusters are developed on larger lots the minimum and maximum building setbacks apply only to the building adjacent to street but the number of buildings set back more than the minimum twentyfive 25 feet or a setback close to twentyfive 25 feet will be minimized image bbuilding setbacks from streets for cluster suburban development twentyfive 25 foot minimum and seventy 70 foot maximum setback if no parking is located in the space between the building and the street seventyfive 75 foot minimum single loading parking and a one hundred twentyfive 125 foot maximum double loaded parking setback when parking is located in such space where building clusters are developed on larger lots the minimum and maximum building setbacks apply only to the buildings adjacent to street but the number of buildings set back more than the minimum of seventyfive 75 feet or a setback close to seventyfive 75 feet will be minimized image cparking offset a minimum of twentyfive 25 feet shall be maintained from back of curb parking lot to rear andor side lot line when commercial use adjoins any residential district except for intensive uses as regulated elsewhere in this code where greater separations are required this space shall be developed as a landscaped feature minimum height of the landscape buffer shall be three feet design specifications are found within the site development standards for nonresidential uses dlandscape design allow parking lot planting islands to be consolidated normally one planting island per twenty 20 parking spaces is required to create larger landscaped areas within parking lots minimum dimensions for the consolidated planting islands shall be twelve 12 feet wide from back of curb to back of curb islands shall be a minimum of one hundred twenty 120 feet long to achieve maximum visual effect and plant massing image 2the dimensional standards in areas designated as context suburban cts

commission recognizes that due to the particularities of any given land use or development the inflexible application of the parking supply requirements set forth in subsection a of this section may result in a land use or development either with inadequate parking supply or parking supply far in excess of its needs therefore the plan commission may permit or require deviations from the requirements of subsection a of this section and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standards set out in subsection b1 and 2 of this section whenever the plan commission permits or requires a modification to the prescribed parking supply requirements it may also request the recording of the same under the provisions of subsection h of this section 1additional parking spaces can be required if it is determined that the prescribed requirement for a particular development will lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets or unauthorized parking in nearby private parking lots 2a reduction in parking spaces can be required if it is determined that the prescribed requirement for a particular development would result in the wasteful use of property that could more desirably be used for additional building development in the case of a land use or development which would produce less parking demand or for environmentally useful or aesthetically pleasing open space cparking location all required offstreet parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the use for which it is required except that required spaces may be permitted at other locations when and as authorized under subsection d of this section the requirements of this section shall be considered satisfied if
