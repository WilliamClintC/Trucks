consistent design placement and color f thus the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health safety and welfare and the aesthetic qualities of the city by controlling the size shape construction and appearance of newsracks in the city as a reasonable time manner and place regulation so as to 1 provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience  2 ensure that there is no

conducted in a manner consistent with the constitutional rights of citizens and regulated parties h given the limited space available within the citys rightsofway the city has a substantial interest in devising a systematic approach to newsrack removal and placement in the city to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of newspapers and periodicals the city council declares that this objective and the other aforementioned objectives are best achieved by adopting this chapter and creating regulations to allow fixed pedestal newsracks of a consistent design placement and color and also by enhancing aesthetic character of public areas in appearance i the city council further declares that allowing only newsracks of a consistent design placement and color in the city directly promotes

the property  4 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges d the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency part 2002   conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles ii and iii of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in of this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary as defined in of this chapter considering the flood hazard to afford relief e variances shall be issued upon the determination by the reviewing authority of all the following 1 a showing of good and sufficient cause  2 a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in of this chapter to the applicant  and 3 a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances as defined in of this chapter cause fraud or victimization as defined in of this chapter of the public or conflict with existing local laws or chapters f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvements and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a e are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety g upon consideration of the factors of c and the purposes of this chapter the reviewing authority may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter h any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the city engineer that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain board in the office of the san bernardino county recorder and

impacts are not expected to occur in a straightline numerical pattern over the 20year period addressed in this chapter consequently an annual limit or target for residential development will not be in harmony with typical market conditions and could counteract necessary and beneficial economic growth this section identifies an appropriate average level of residential development and then allows new residential construction to fluctuate within a fiveyear period while generally maintaining the overall average at times residential development may exceed the yearly average but may likely be offset by other years when development may be less than average when it appears that the fiveyear average will be exceeded in any fiveyear period the city council will consider taking corrective actions the absolute limit on residential development for any fiveyear period cannot exceed 25 percent more than the anticipated average without the implementation of such corrective actions commercial development is not limited in any given year or fiveyear period the amounts of commercial and residential development are closely correlated therefore pacing residential development also indirectly paces commercial development b the anticipated fiveyear demand for residential development is projected to be 1100 additional dwelling units this number is established by dividing the total 20year

city of big bear lake is empowered to enact measures that protect the health safety and welfare of its citizens b the development of residential commercial and industrial property in the city of big bear lake will create increased calls for fire protection services as a result new fire suppression facilities vehicles and equipment will be needed to maintain current levels of service and maintain safe emergency response times within the city c the city council finds that the proposed fire suppression facilities vehicles and equipment are identified in of the development impact fee calculation and nexus report and master facilities plan for big bear lake ca report and are necessary to provide fire protection services to the city of big bear lake d the city council further finds that the fire suppression development fee program is necessary to establish administrative regulations and authority for a funding mechanism for the acquisition and construction of fire suppression facilities vehicles and equipment as these are identified in the report and is necessary to provide funding to maintain adequate fire protection services to the residences and businesses of the city of big bear lake e with regard to the methodology for levying the fire suppression development fee the city council further finds that 1 the report describes in detail the number of fire calls for service that typical single and multiple family residential commercialoffice and industrial uses generate the expanded fire suppression facilities vehicles and equipment required to service new development in the city and the estimated costs of those facilities vehicles and equipment 2 the estimated cost for the fire suppression facilities vehicles and equipment as described in the reports is based upon current construction costs for similar facilities constructed in the city of big bear lake and comparable cities and current acquisition costs although the report was prepared in february of 200 the city council finds that the construction and acquisition costs identified are less than or equal to current construction and acquisition costs as such use of the 2002 report is reasonable and will not lead to charges that exceed the reasonable costs for providing the services the city council finds that the method for estimating the costs of is reasonably based on a square footage basis and will not exceed the reasonably estimated total of these costs 3 the land use element of the general plan and development the city of big bear lake specify the permitted uses of land within the city and

facilities vehicles and equipment and personnel costs as described in the report and as proposed to be funded by the fire suppression development fee are apportioned relative to the anticipated impacts created by new development within the city of big bear lake and that the fees are fairly apportioned on individual residential dwelling units and proposed commercialindustrial development on a square footage basis throughout the city on the basis of benefits conferred on property proposed for development and the need for such facilities created by such development 6 the facts and evidence establish that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the fire suppression facilities vehicles and equipment and the types of development upon which the fee will be imposed and that

local agency shall adopt an ordinance which totally precludes second units within singlefamily and multifamily residential zones unless certain findings are made in said ordinance pursuant to c the purpose of this section of the development to set forth the required findings to preclude the establishments of second units within singlefamily residential zones in accordance with state law for purposes of this section a second dwelling unit shall mean a separate dwelling unit on a residential lot zoned for singlefamily residences including zones rl and r1 where a dwelling unit already exists b the following findings are made in support of prohibiting second dwelling units in residential zones within the city 1 the limitation on second units will not result in a housing shortage because of the abundance of vacant dwelling units and the lack of a demonstrated need for second units in order to meet housing objectives as set forth in the general plan housing element on  the city of big bear lake adopted which prohibited the establishment of second units in residential zones based on the required findings of c of the california government that ordinance the city council found that due to the nature of the local touristbased economy approximately seventy percent 70% of the dwelling units in big bear lake were not occupied by fulltime residents and adequate housing stock was available to serve the housing needs of the community at that time based on the citys certified housing element adopted on  and on data provided by the california department of finance as of  the number of dwelling units occupied on a parttime basis has remained at seventy percent 70% or greater records maintained by the city indicate that over twenty percent 20% of the dwelling units that are not permanently occupied are used as transient private home rental units the remainder of the vacant dwelling units are maintained as vacation homes or offered as longterm rentals due to the large number of vacant dwelling units the prohibition against second units on residential lots will not limit housing opportunities in the city in addition the 2002 housing element indicated that for the 20002005 planning period residential development in the city had already exceeded the regional housing needs allocation for the city as determined by the southern california association of governments therefore adequate housing is still being constructed to meet the housing demand of new residents in the city without the creation of second units on residential lots finally the city has provided opportunities for accessory dwelling units in all commercial land use designations of the general plan up to a maximum of three units per parcel based on the general plan density in order to encourage mixed use development and alternative housing such as livework spaces in addition the city has designated areas for multiple family residential development in excess of the amount needed to provide anticipated housing needs therefore the city has provided ample opportunities to meet housing demand without the use of second units 2 adverse impacts on the public health safety and welfare would result from allowing second units within singlefamily and multifamily zoned areas because the city has documented evidence that second units on singlefamily lots have been and will be used as transient private home rentals for shortterm vacation rental purposes rather than for meeting the housing needs of low to moderate income households because big bear lake is a recreation resort community attracting over five million visitors each year for winter and summer sports activities there is a high demand for vacation lodging to meet this need the city has allowed the use of singlefamily residential units as transient private home rentals since 199 as provided for and regulated by this development of 200 there are over one thousand two hundred 1200 dwelling units in the city registered as transient private home rental units the city receives numerous requests from homeowners wishing to establish a second dwelling unit on a singlefamily residential lot for shortterm vacation rental purposes in order to generate income from their property allowing second units on singlefamily residential lots could potentially double the density of residential units within existing neighborhoods for the purpose of creating additional shortterm vacation rental units resulting in an increased burden on infrastructure systems including local streets trash collection sewer and water systems but without increasing housing opportunities in addition the doubling of residential density for purposes of facilitating establishment of shortterm vacation rental units will increase adverse impacts to existing residential neighborhoods including traffic noise and disruption from transient occupants finally the increased use of residential neighborhoods for transient private home rentals may have an adverse impact on the local touristbased economy by increasing competition with commercial lodging establishments from residential property owners operating multiple vacation rental units  exh a part 2003 exh a 12122011   development and performance standards for ancillary uses within commercial lodging facilities and bed and breakfast establishments for the
