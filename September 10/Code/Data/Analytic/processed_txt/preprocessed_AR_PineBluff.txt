employment findings the city council of the city of pine bluff does hereby find that 1 numerous scientific studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution  2 reliable scientific studies including studies by the surgeon general of the united states and studies commissioned and assessed by the us environmental protection agency have shown that breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard to nonsmokers by increasing the risk of heart disease stroke respiratory disease and lung cancer that children have an increased risk of asthma respiratory infections sudden infant death syndrome developmental abnormalities and cancer and to the elderly or others with compromised immune systems  3 health hazards induced by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke include lung and other forms of cancer respiratory infection decreased respiratory function decreased exercise tolerance bronchoconstriction and bronchospasm and that the most common cause of premature death from environmental tobacco smoke is heart disease  4 reliable scientific studies assessed by the us environmental protection agency have found that sidestream and secondhand tobacco smoke is a leading cause of premature death and disability among nonsmokers  5 air pollution caused by smoking is an offensive annoyance and irritant smoking results in serious and significant physical discomfort of nonsmokers in public places and work places  and 6 it is within its basic police powers to implement and enforce the provisions of this article 7 electronic smoking devices commonly known as electronic cigarettes ecigarettes ecigars ecigarillos epipes ehookahs electronic nicotine delivery systems etc are battery operated devices designed to deliver nicotine flavor andor other substances vapor inhaled by the user  and 8 use of electronic smoking devices has increased significantly in recent years  and 9 existing studies on electronic smoking devices vapor emissions and cartridge contents have found a number of dangerous substances including chemicals known to cause cancer such as formaldehyde acetaldehyde lead nickel and chromium  pm25 acrolein tin toluene and aluminum which are associated with a range of negative health effects such as skin eye and respiratory irritation neurological effects damage to reproductive systems and even premature death from heart attacks and stroke  inconsistent labeling of nicotine levels in electronic smoking device products  and in one 1 instance diethylene glycol an ingredient used in antifreeze and toxic to humans 10 more than one 1 study has concluded that exposure to vapor from electronic smoking devices may cause passive or secondhand vaping  and 11 the world health organization has strongly advised consumers against the use of electronic smoking devices until they are deemed safe and effective and of acceptable quality by a competent national regulatory body  and 12 the world medical association has determined that electronic smoking devices are not comparable to scientifically proven methods of smoking cessation and that neither their value as therapeutic aids for smoking cessation nor their safety as cigarette replacements is established  and 13 a study published in the journal of environmental and public health suggests that electronic smoking devices may have the capacity to renormalize tobacco use in a demographic that has had significant denormalization of tobacco use previously  and 14 electronic smoking devices often mimic conventional tobacco products in shape size and color with the user exhaling a smokelike vapor similar in appearance to the exhaled smoke from cigarettes and other conventional tobacco products  and 15 the use of electronic smoking devices in smokefree locations threatens to undermine compliance with smoking regulations and reverse the progress that has been made in establishing a social norm that smoking is not permitted in public places and places of employment  and 14 it is the intent of the pine bluff city council in enacting this section to provide for the public health safety and welfare by prohibiting the use of electronic smoking devices  by protecting the public from exposure to secondhand by products of electronic smoking devices  by facilitating uniform and consistent enforcement of smokefree air laws  by reducing the potential for renormalizing smoking in public places and places of employment  and by reducing the potential for children to associate the use of electronic smoking devices with a normative or healthy lifestyle  6605  a 4317 definitions for the purpose of this article the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning bar

municipal stormwater control fee footnotes  6  editors note  adopted jan 18 201 did not specifically amend the   therefore these provisions have been included as div 2  2818128183 at the editors discretion findings the city council finds and determines 1 that federal law and regulation require the city to provide for a system of collecting treatment and disposal of stormwater runoff in order to combat water pollution  2 that stormwater can carry contaminants such as plastic bags detergents nutrients heavy metals and pollution which can be harmful to the environment in addition erosion can contribute to the contaminants contained in stormwater runoff as well as damage residential and commercial property  3 that aging or inadequate designed infrastructure designed to carry stormwater can result in flooding during major storm events and that debris swept into ditches and waterways during storm events can prevent the proper movement of storm water adding to flood risks  4 that adoption of a minimal flat fee to be paid by owners of realty by remittance with the monthly water charge rather than a fee based on equivalent rate units relating to the impervious area of a parcel or based on square footage is the simplest most expeditious means to defray the cost of compliance with the federal law and regulations  5 that the fee assessed by this division is in the vast majority of cases less than the fee would be if based on impervious area or square footage  6 that the collection of the fee is most cost efficient and convenient being included as part of the monthly water

is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city the provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing

cleveland ohio  and beaumont texas  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this article as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theatres adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 at least fifty 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b nona nonb amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united statessix hundred 600 in 1982  two thousand two hundred 2200 in 1983  four thousand six hundred 4600 in 1984  eight thousand five hundred fiftyfive 8555 in 1985  two hundred fiftythree thousand four hundred fortyeight 253448 in 1992  and five hundred seventythree thousand eight hundred 573800  8 as of june 200 there have been two thousand eight hundred sixtyfive 2865 reported cases of aids in the state of arkansas 9 since 1981 and to the present there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the hiv antibody test in arkansas four thousand seven hundred fiftysix 4756 10 the number of cases of early less than one 1 year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with thirtythree thousand six hundred thirteen 33613 cases reported in 1982 and fortyfive thousand two hundred 45200 of 1990 11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million 500000 cases being reported in 1990 12 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 16 the findings noted in paragraphs number 1 15 raise substantial governmental concerns 17 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article 24 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 25 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article i 122000 definitions adult arcade means any place to which the public is permitted or invited wherein coinoperated slugoperated
