development in the terraced streetscape district  225a01 intent 182019  225a02 purpose 182019  225a03 statutory authority 182019 1 the standards included in this are intended to establish guidelines for development activity in the area designated as the terraced streetscape zoning district on the townships official zoning map the district generally extends from the township boundary on the east to blue course drive on the west and from west campus drive on the north to beaver avenue on the south 2 these guidelines are intended to aid the township and property owners in making sensitive and appropriate decisions with regard to the built environment and quality of space within the district adherence to these design standards will ensure that the built environment is attractive and harmonious with both other parts of the built environment and the natural environment it will also promote vitality and a pedestrian focused area that is distinguishable in character from the surrounding area 1 design guidelines provide a common basis for making decisions about design elements that affect individual properties as well as the overall character of the district the guidelines are not intended to dictate solutions but rather provide general information to guide the township and property owners in making decisions by providing appropriate choices for a variety of specific design issues the guidelines are intended to inform the community and property owners of the policies and standards expected by the township within the established district and to ensure quality development that enhances the character of the district 2 the provisions of this also identify several design approaches that will enhance both the appearance and potential value of existing properties within the district and help to ensure that the desired character is established uniformly 3 this will serve as a guide to the township but will not necessarily dictate the final outcome each project has unique circumstances that will be considered and result in the township applying the standards on a projectbyproject basis  ensuring that the character of individual structures observes the fundamental standards of quality anticipated within the district 1 pursuant to  708a of the pennsylvania municipalities planning the written and graphic design guidelines included herein are  225a01 foreword  225a03 fwd637  225a04 goals 182019 established to assist applicants in the preparation of land development plans for projects within the terraced streetscape zoning district the design guidelines take effect only when a project is initiated by a property owner or tenant to alter an existing structure or to construct a new one the guidelines do not require existing properties to initiate changes nor is there any deadline that forces existing properties into compliance or otherwise alters the nonconforming rights established in  2 property owners tenants developers and architects are encouraged to use these guidelines as a starting point for all projects within the terraced streetscape district these standards will assist them by providing a basic framework for planning of a project and serve as a reference as well as regulatory manual the township will apply these provisions in the review and approval of development proposals and in the issuance of permits as a measure of the observance of the goals and intent of the district 1 the goal of the application of the design standards set forth herein is to shape and protect the character and appeal of the terraced streetscape district within the township these provisions are designed to ensure that all proposed new construction and renovation or expansion activity is consistent with the standards of quality as well as respect for the built environment within the district as it relates to appearance scale and density 2 specific goals include a to promote and improve the perception of the district b to protect the desired appearance of the district c to promote a sense of identity and place d to prioritize and encourage pedestrian activity e to convey a sense of humanpedestrian scale in common areas streetscaped areas and public outdoor spaces f to ensure development practices within the district meet the expected standards g to attract a dynamic and diverse concentration of uses and to foster economic interaction among the mix of uses in the district h to ensure sustainability of the development 47editors note see 53 ps  10708a  225a03 ferguson code  225a05 fwd638  225a05 context 182019 development projects within an urban or suburban setting are part of a larger context that requires that architects developers and approval authorities make decisions within the parameters of an established and diverse physical setting each project within the terraced streetscape district will ultimately become part of the larger neighborhood fabric and environmental context a sensitivity to the natural features of land water and vegetation in the development project buildings within the district should therefore be planned with the utmost consideration for adjacent structures and properties while exhibiting compliance with the principal goals of the district and thoughtfulness for the overall quality of place and adherence to a sensitivity of natural resources  225a06 design principles 182019  225a07 synergy 182019 1 successful urban environments accommodate and foster multiple uses and activities while simultaneously addressing human scale and safety these environments result from the cumulative effect of welldesigned individual sites that are mindful of their context enjoyable and pleasant streetscapes as well as walkable destinations combine to give a neighborhood its recognizable character to accomplish this proper zoning and architectural standards need to be applied 2 basic principles of project planning and site design within the terraced streetscape district include a promote a diversity of usesoccupancies b create functional pedestrian bikeway and public transit linkages c foster a distinctive identity that prioritizes high quality design and development d incorporate the landscape and green spaces into civic assets e foster intensity of development and compactness f use landscaping green space and existing vegetation to address traffic calming issues of identity territoriality and privacy g ensure the perception of safety by way of proper lightingsightline strategies 1 the district is designed to encourage as much density and mix of occupancies as is practical it is the synergy of diverse and complimentary uses that make a mixeduse neighborhood experientially rich and attractive in such mixeduse settings the issues of identity territoriality and privacy need to be addressed as do connectivity to public common areas gathering spaces public transit and retail and  225a05 foreword  225a07 fwd639  225a08 density 182019 the issue of proper density and compactness can be measured in several ways standards of density derived from national guidelines established by the congress for new urbanism will be used as a basis for proposed projects in the terraced streetscape district nonresidential development should achieve a density whereby the floor area ratio far for the site is 10 or greater any residential development within a vertical mixeduse structure should achieve a minimum density of 10 unitsunit per acre or higher these recommended densities when enhanced by proper attention to articulation and detail and integrated with the planned streetscape design will lend themselves to a more urban and vibrant neighborhood along the west college avenue corridor  225a09 streetscape design standards 18 2019 service

incorporated subject to the review and approval of cata the style of shelter shall be consistent with the overall site furnishings palette 2 streets perpendicular to the west college avenue corridor will also provide for a variety of uses but at a slightly reduced scale the sidewalks and streetscape treatment along these streets will be correspondingly reduced in scale with fixtures and landscape features more conducive to a side street location  225a09 ferguson code  225a10 fwd644  225a11 building massing and composition  182019 1 consideration toward scale and the transition of building height from one site to the next must be taken into account while abrupt changes in scale between two adjacent properties are generally discouraged articulation of the building to address relevant issues of scale combined with appropriate setbacks and landscaping can help soften these transitions graduated massing of building heights is preferred and should be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of the district as specified herein as well as in zoning 2 larger infill development that respects massing and articulation becomes a harmonious part of the block 3 structures on west college avenue are to be located on or near the street line as to engender a physical presence on the main thoroughfare and support a more pedestriancentered focus parking areas in front of buildings are prohibited as are any other features that detract from pedestrian access to the front of the building building entrances shall be designed in such a manner as to be immediately recognizable accessible and safe a it is the intent of the district to create the greatest practical commercial density along the west college avenue corridor commercial occupancies perform best when they are visible and easily accessible storefronts are to be designed to be as open and transparent as practical in accordance with the district regulations  225a10 foreword  225a12 fwd645  225a12 articulation of facades 182019 1 development projects within the terraced streetscape district shall be mindful of the fact that wellarticulated building facades provide visual interest and enhance the experience of the neighborhood whereas large unarticulated building masses can negate any sense of human scale within the block large buildings that are sensible in their composition and reverent to the scale of pedestrians are generally more successful and appealing a new buildings in the district shall observe some of the basic parameters of scale and proportion see examples below it is the intent of these regulations to ensure that no single building appear too diminutive as to defy the basic tenets of the district which requires that landowners maximize the volume and development potential of their site 1 singlestory building facades are required to convey a greater sense of height consistent with the scale of adjacent or surrounding multistory structures of a parapet all structures fronting on west college avenue shall conform to the building height regulations of the district 2 all structures shall convey the greatest practical density and vibrancy by way of articulating multiple occupancytenancy ground floor storefront design this will enhance the pedestrian experience as well as improve the massing of larger commercial structures b streetscapes and building facade design in the district are required to execute the rhythm created by many individual facades and storefronts that relate to the scale of the pedestrian a buildings massing shall contribute positively to a pedestrianfriendly public realm long unbroken walls are overwhelming and must be divided into rhythmic blocks bringing the design of the facade closer to a human scale c larger buildings are required to subdivide the appearance of their facades and storefronts as to make them seem to be smaller  225a12 ferguson code  225a12 fwd646 individual buildings articulation by means of material difference color difference and verticalhorizontal variation in alignment recesses or projections are required to accomplish the appearance of individual facades 1 the upper floors of multistory buildings are required to provide a differentiation of color or material to break up the facade massing of the building exterior 2 storefronts and facade treatment at ground level must be differentiated every 40 feet or less to provide proper articulation at street level d the ground floor of any multistory building is required to be articulated from the stories above it the appearance of a specialized and welcoming storefront building entrance or any other pedestrian appropriate treatment is required to enhance the pedestrian street life generated in the district e where buildings of 55 feet or higher are proposed in addition to articulating their ground floor articulation of their uppermost floors must occur as well f facade treatment of multistory buildings should also include appropriate consideration in the design of the top of the building  225a12 foreword  225a12 fwd647  225a13 storefront design 182019 rooflines for pitched roof structures should be articulated to subdivide the mass and appearance of the roof area toward the predominant facade strategies include the introduction of dormers roofed vents chimney stacks or variation in finished rooflines g facade treatment for flat roofed buildings shall include parapets builtup cornices or both as appropriate to the architectural style of the proposed building building tops shall be visually interesting and compliment the character of the building as well as contributing positively to the character of the district h multistory buildings due to their size and presence are encouraged to be creative in their use of massing articulation and design developers of multistory buildings shall consider their appearance from multiple vantage points 1 commercial occupancies at ground floor level especially spaces intended for retail or restaurant uses are required to incorporate standards for successful storefront design good storefront design integrates means of maximizing transparency and openness with durability and energy efficiency a storefronts need to be differentiated every 40 feet maximum from one another to create an attractive and visual interest for pedestrians the surface area of storefronts in the district is required to be 50% minimum transparent glass to optimize public viewing this will enhance the pedestrian experience  225a12 ferguson code  225a13 fwd648  225a14 corner building sites 182019 b storefronts shall be constructed with durable finishes consistent with the expected high trafficpedestrian environment consideration must also be given to lighting strategies so that both the storefront and the interior space behind it are well lit and easily seen c avoid excessive visual clutter  especially that produced by too much interior signage d outdoor signage shall fit the character and proportion of the building and enhance the architecture signage shall be clearly visible without dominating the building facade or obscuring architectural details e benches and other moveable objects such as bike racks or trash containers shall be coordinated with the building entrance so as not to obstruct sidewalk traffic or diminish the appearance of the facade f awnings andor vegetation may be utilized to add interest and aesthetic quality to the building and the streetscape awnings and canopies must be compatible with the building and windows in scale proportion and color 1 corner buildings serve as landmarks within the district and as a result special consideration must be given to their design so that they address the intersection as well as complimenting other adjacent buildings in the district a proposed corner buildings need to address the intersection they front inclusion of accentuating features such as towers turrets chamfers canopies or recessed areaways to highlight their cornermost facades 1 building corners can be accentuated in a variety of ways employing novel geometries while utilizing the same color palette is a subtle approach while the introduction of more  225a13 foreword  225a14 fwd649  225a15 parking structures and incentives  182019 elaborate elements and accent materials andor color results in a more predominantmore recognizable structure 2 a common approach is to differentiate the bay of the building that is closest to the corner use of offsets additional height and differences in roofline color or material this will help to delineate and symbolically mark the intersection and physically note its importance 3 the creation of additional public space on the corner can be achieved use of a recessed or chamfered entrance that broadens the common area and makes the space more usable porticos colonnades stoops vegetation and similar features fronting the corner further enhance the presence of the building and improve the visual character 1 parking structures and elevated parking decks within the district need to exhibit sensitivity to scale and massing these structures also need to relate to pedestrian scale and attempt to integrate with other structures in the broader environment by way of articulation and material usage a key objective shall be to disguise the structures function as car storage use of screening elements spandrel panels or glazing systems in conjunction with good facade design strategies a design strategies that include locating stairwells andor elevator towers on a corner or public accessway improves the overall pedestrian interface with these structures while also improving their massing these strategies also open the possibility of improved articulation fenestration and use of materials for facade enhancement lighting can also be employed to further enhance and accent the structure providing a visual focal point at night 1 material andor color usage shall differentiate the ground and upper floors of the structure to improve the relationship with pedestrian scale and the streetscape 2 facades shall avoid the appearance of support columns unless combined with a screening system use of masonry composite panels or eifs systems will lend a sense of permanence and evoke the image of a conventional building rather than an open deck 3 metal or mesh screening systems can be used to obscure stored cars these systems should also employ masonry or other suitable material so that the resulting facade does not appear out of character  225a14 ferguson code  225a15 fwd650 4 glazing or curtain wall systems can also be used to screen cars and achieve the look of a more conventional building window walls or windows set in a backup wall can be detailed to create a more uniform and interesting appearance to the overall structure while concealing its use for parking 5 installation of green roofs can be used to a retain rainwater and together with plants return a portion of this water to the atmosphere transpiration evapotranspiration b reduce and clean stormwater volume c retain and delay runoff to ease stress on stormwater infrastructure and sewers b storefronts and leasable commercial space shall be incorporated into the ground floor plan of parking structures the storefronts shall enhance the streetscape and conform to the design requirements of the terraced streetscape zoning c parking incentives 1 the parking requirements for nonresidential development or nonresidential uses within vertical mixeduse structures as set forth herein may be reduced by use of the following a provide additional landscaping andor open space that is 20% greater than that required by this chapter reduce total required parking spaces by 10%  225a15 foreword  225a15 fwd651  225a16 exterior materials 182019  225a17 color selection 182019 b provide and maintain at least 10% of the housing units as agerestricted units reduce total required parking spaces by 15% c provide and maintain at least 10% of the housing units as owneroccupied workforce housing units reduce total required parking spaces by 15% 2 the incentives may be mixed or matched but no incentive may be used to obtain multiple bonuses for example a green roof may count toward additional impervious on a lot or an extra story of structured parking but not both 1 buildings designed with authentic materials in a manner that evidences craftsmanship and detail lend a sense of authenticity and permanence to the buildings themselves authentic and permanent materials on building exteriors will provide visual continuity and discernible character to the zoning district a authentic materials such as brick cast stone limestone concrete block and other conventional masonry products should be used exterior finish systems and proprietary panel systems can be employed to the extent that they complement the material quality of the building and surrounding structures and are used in combination with more permanentnatural materials a synthetic or eifs clad building with a masonry base detail for example 1 in general it is recommended that the color palette selected for the building exterior not include exceptionally bright or overly colorful schemes subtle and complimentary color choices such as more naturalistic or muted tones are suggested however vibrant colors can be used for accent and trim a painted strips or pronounced patterns on wall surfaces or large surface areas of brilliant color are distracting and shall be avoided  225a15 ferguson code  225a17 fwd652  225a18 signage 182019  225a19 lighting 182019 1 it is important that the nature of the signage employed by a business does not conflict with the character or goals of the district good sign design can both enhance the business and add a dimension of vibrancy and visual interest a the following recommendations shall be considered 1 signs hung parallel to the business shall not overwhelm the storefront or architectural detail of the building 2 lighting shall not produce glare and automated signage shall not be permitted 3 signs should be designed to draw the attention of the pedestrian rather than motorists within the district projecting signage hung perpendicular to the building is recommended 4 graphics should be clear and legible limited text or company colorslogos should be considered over a heavily stylized or cluttered and confusing sign face 1 the lighting of buildings entryways building surfaces or landscape within the district is desirable exterior lighting will enliven the district and add a sense of vibrancy as well as enhancing the safety of the area the use of energy efficient luminaires or led lighting is encouraged a commercial facades in the district should utilize lighting in a creative and innovative manner to highlight their business however visually distracting and automated signage or moving lighting shall not be permitted b lighting that produces glare or impedes the vision of motorists or pedestrian traffic is prohibited surface mounted lighting must  225a17 foreword  225a19 fwd653 have fixtures that are aimed directly at the targeted facade or surface area and away from traffic c the surface uplighting of a building is allowed  however light spillage or glare onto adjacent buildings or properties

processoriented design procedures for application by land development professionals it is recognized that in an attempt to generalize the computational procedures assumptions have been made which on some occasions may be violated if such a violation is identified alternate standards and procedures may be applied both the violation and the alternate procedures to be applied must be documented by a hydrologist or hydrogeologist any request for use of alternate standards or procedures under this provision must be agreed to by the township engineer prior to formal submission of plans for consideration by the township a peak runoff rate control 1 exemptions a any site where the increase in postdevelopment peak runoff rates is determined to be negligible by the township engineer is exempt from the requirement to provide stormwater detention in support of this exemption it must be shown that the downstream conveyance systems have adequate capacity to convey the additional discharge without adversely affecting downstream properties this does not exempt the requirement for implementation of designs for water quality stormwater conveyance andor recharge as required a stormwater management site plan and report documenting these design elements is also required the township engineer shall use a fivepercent increase as a general benchmark for defining negligible the final definition of negligible shall be at the township engineers discretion prior to using this exemption and prior to any land development plan submission the design engineer must provide written documentation and computations as to why no peak runoff control should be required the township engineer has the right to reject any plan that uses this assumption without prior approval of the township engineer the intent of this exemption is to eliminate the need for multiple or piggyback detention facilities as a result of minor changes in imperviousness or land use upstream of existing stormwater control facilities b small sites less than one acre located directly adjacent to the main stem of creeks or within the floodplain are not required to provide stormwater detention unless directed to do so by the township engineer as a result of a documented drainage problem all other stormwater management standards must be implemented including water quality adequate stormwater conveyance andor recharge as required the township engineer has the right to reject any plan that uses this exemption without prior approval of the township engineer  26304 foreword  26304 fwd769 2 stormwater management analysis must be performed using the following models the size criteria are based on drainage area size including site area and all offsite area draining across the development drainage area size acres model up to 100 nrcss tr55 or tr20 over 100 nrcss tr20 or hec1 hechms a the modified rational method using the gert aron curves may be used for any site less than or equal to two acres in size without prior authorization from the township engineer the modified rational method may also be used for sites between two acres and five acres in size where the township engineer has approved the methods use in this case the design engineer must make a written request to the township engineer explaining why the use of the modified rational method is more appropriate than the nrcss natural resource conservation service methods for the site in question the design engineer should keep in mind that the modified rational formula methodology was not calibrated to account for the karst nature of the spring creek drainage basin  and therefore its use should be limited to the special cases identified above in addition since the minimum discharge criteria are based on a calibration of the nrcs runoff model their use is not appropriate if the modified rational method is used for runoff computations b the township engineer has the right to reject any stormwater management design that uses hydrograph combinations with the modified rational method where the designer has not validated that the effects of the timing differences are negligible in addition the township engineer has the right to reject any stormwater management design that improperly uses the method for determining runoff volumes or does not properly apply the method c more intensive physically based models may be used at the discretion of the township engineer but only for sites greater than 100 acres in size d commercial software packages that use the basic computational methods of tr55 or tr20 are permitted e the nrcs models and methods recommended above are based on data collected from actual watersheds in  26304 ferguson code  26304 fwd770 contrast to this stormwater management analysis for land development activities is often conducted using property lines to define drainage boundaries drainage areas based on property boundaries are not true watersheds and are referred to here as hypothetical drainage areas it is known that these hypothetical drainage areas do not respond like natural watersheds peak runoff rates from hypothetical drainage areas are much smaller than comparable runoff rates from natural watersheds of the same size therefore wherever possible pre and postdevelopment stormwater analysis should be conducted for watersheds that are as nearly natural as possible also conducting stormwater analysis for a lot by lot comparison such as within residential developments is not permitted partitioning drainage areas into different subwatersheds for the postdevelopment scenarios is acceptable f it is noted that natural watershed boundaries should not be used where the relative size of the watershed compared to the site size would inappropriately distort the pre to postdevelopment runoff comparison in these cases a hypothetical drainage area defined by the property boundary should be used because it will allow for a better estimate of runoff changes directly downstream of the site in addition the designer should recognize that within the spring creek watershed typical hypothetical drainage areas in their predevelopment or natural condition do not produce surface runoff during minor to moderate rainfall events available hydrologic models do not accurately reflect this condition this often results in postdevelopment nuisance flooding since the models overestimate the predevelopment runoff magnitude 3 major natural drainage divides may not be altered without the prior consent of the township engineer 4 pre and postdevelopment stormwater management analysis shall be conducted using the following design storms oneyear twoyear tenyear onehundredyear 5 the twentyfourhour precipitation depths as obtained from noaa atlas 14 shall be used for stormwater management analysis for all of ferguson township penndot idf curves may be used only if required by penndot 6 the nrcss type ii precipitation distribution is required for all stormwater management analyses 7 the nrcss dimensionless unit hydrograph k factor shall be 484 for both pre and postdevelopment stormwater analyses  26304 foreword  26304 fwd771 8 all undeveloped areas are to be modeled as meadow or woods in good hydrologic condition existing impervious areas may be modeled as being impervious for predevelopment conditions the township may require a maximum of 20% of the existing impervious be modeled as meadow in areas where there are known existing stormwater concerns downstream of the project area or where the site being developed has either deficient or nonexisting stormwater management facilities developers of sites with existing impervious are highly encouraged to set up a meeting with the township prior to design so that any additional requirements are identified prior to plan submission 9 the nrcss curve number cn shall be used as the rainfall to runoff transformation parameter for all stormwater management analyses 10 curve numbers should be rounded to tenths for use in prepackaged hydrologic models it should be recognized that the cn is only a design tool with a large degree of statistical variability for large sites cns should realistically be rounded to the nearest whole number 11 the nrcss method to determine unconnected impervious area adjustments for cn may be used for distinctly defined impervious land areas that flow onto pervious areas in a dispersed manner the method may only be used to calculate runoff from site impervious areas that actually flow across pervious areas the method cannot be applied to the entire site using average weighted cn values 12 soils underlain by carbonate geology limestone or dolomite shall have a hydrologic soil group hsg b used for both preand postdevelopment conditions regardless of the nrcs or centre county soil surveys description except for the following two conditions a with the exception of minimally disturbed areas the hsg for all disturbed pervious areas shall be reduced by a minimum of 1 hsg level to reflect an increase in runoff associated with the loss of natural soil structure no reduction in postconstruction hsg level is required in areas where soil restoration techniques are applied acceptable soil restoration techniques include those defined in the current version of the pennsylvania stormwater best management practices manual other techniques may be accepted if approved by the township engineer b soils identified as on floodplains or on terraces above floodplains in the centre county soil survey will use the  26304 ferguson code  26304 fwd772 hsg as designated in the soil survey refer to appendix a66 for a list of the soils 13 soils not underlain by carbonate geology shall use the hsg as specified by the nrcs or centre county soil surveys description except for the following two conditions a wooded areas on hsg c and d soils shall be treated as hsg b for predevelopment conditions disturbed postdevelopment wooded areas shall carry the nrcs or centre county soil surveys defined hsg with a minimum hsg of b b highly compacted structural fill areas shall use a minimum of hsg c for postdevelopment conditions regardless of the nrcs or centre county soil surveys description for most developments these areas are normally covered with impervious surfaces but may include islands within parking areas fringe land etc a hsg of c shall also be used for large projects that clear and grade land for later phases of development the township engineer shall make the final determination as to what areas of a land development site constitute compacted structural fill the intent is to account for large compacted areas and not minor grading within lawn areas or small areas around buildings etc 14 areas draining to closed depressions must be modeled by removing the storage volume from the predevelopment condition the designer may assume that infiltration in the closed depression does not occur during a design runoff event areas draining to closed depressions may also be used to adjust peak runoff rates to stormwater management ponds for the postdevelopment analysis this allowance has been developed to entice designers to intentionally design or leave in place small closed depressions that can reduce the total volume required from a stormwater management pond the site designer is responsible to document downstream impacts if the closed depression were removed 15 drainage areas tributary to sinkholes shall be excluded from the modeled pointofinterest drainage areas defining predevelopment peak flows assumptions that sinkholes spillover during some storm events must be supported by acceptable documentation as determined by the township engineer in addition the design professional must be aware that bypassing or sealing sinkholes will frequently result in downstream flooding and should not be done if existing downstream flooding already occurs the site designer is 66editors note appendix a is included as an attachment to this chapter  26304 foreword  26304 fwd773 responsible to document downstream impacts if the sinkhole were to stop taking stormwater runoff 16 ponds or other permanent pools of water are to be modeled by the methods established in the nrcss tr55 manual 1986 however more rigorous documented methods are acceptable as determined by the township engineer 17 the nrcs antecedent runoff condition ii arc ii previously amc ii must be used for all simulations the use of continuous simulation models that vary the arc are not permitted for stormwater management purposes in addition prior to any continuous simulation model being used in the spring creek basin for any other purposes the model unit hydrograph must be modified for common events in additional to extreme events based on an indepth analysis of historical data from the basin 18 time of concentration a the following time of concentration tc computational methodologies shall be used unless another method is preapproved by the township engineer 1 predevelopment nrcss lag equation 2 postdevelopment  commercial industrial or other areas with large impervious areas greater than 20% impervious area nrcss segmental method 3 postdevelopment  residential cluster or other lowimpact designs less than or equal to 20% impervious area ncrss lag equation b the time of concentration is to represent the average condition that best reflects the hydrologic response of the area for example large impervious areas bordered by small pervious areas may not consider the effect of the pervious areas in the tc computation if the designer wants to consider the effect of the pervious area runoff from the pervious and impervious areas must be computed separately with the hydrographs being combined to determine the total runoff from the area c under no circumstance will the postdevelopment tc be greater than the predevelopment tc for any watershed or subwatershed modeling purposes this includes when the designer has specifically used swales to reduce flow velocities in the event that the designer believes that the postdevelopment tc is greater it will still be set by default equal to the predevelopment tc for modeling purposes  26304 ferguson code  26304 fwd774 1 refer to 28 regarding impervious area flashing iaf 19 postdevelopment minimum discharges a the following postdevelopment minimum discharges are permitted for use with the nrcs cn runoff model return period minimum discharge 1year qpmin    da + 02 2year qpmin   003 da + 04 10year qpmin   009 da + 10 where da   the drainage area in acres qpmin   minimum allowable peak runoff rate in cfs b for return periods greater than 10 years the minimum discharge shall be equal to the computed predevelopment peak runoff rate c the minimum discharge criteria above are not appropriate for use with the modified rational method this is because these values were developed based on nrcs model corrections and do not actually represent a true physical process or discharge however common sense should be used by both the designer and reviewer in the evaluation of acceptable minimum discharges for use with the modified rational method d the intent of the minimum discharge is to allow reasonable runoff release from a site when a hydrologic model has produced a predevelopment runoff rate close to zero the method is not permitted for areas that previously drained completely to sinkholes in order to bypass the sinkhole after development e these minimum discharge values include the total of all stormwater management facilities discharges and undetained area discharges peak runoff rates for undetained fringe areas where the designer has made a realistic effort to control all new impervious areas will be computed using the predevelopment time of concentration for the drainage areas tributary to them undetained areas are those portions of the site that cannot be routed to a stormwater management facility due to topography and typically include lower pond berms or small areas around entrance drives the site drainage areas used shall  26304 foreword  26304 fwd775 represent the predevelopment condition even if drainage areas are altered following development 20 all lined stormwater management ponds in carbonate and noncarbonate areas must be considered impervious and may not be used as pervious areas for stormwater management computations lined here means lined with synthetic liners or bentonite all other compacted soil liners will be considered to be hsg d for hydrologic computations 21 stormwater management ponds that have a capture depth for the purposes of water quality or volume capture shall assume a negligible discharge from these structures during design event routing only discharges from the primary principal spillway or emergency spillway need to be considered discharges from subsurface drains that tie into a principal spillway should not be considered during design event routing all subsurface drains are to be equipped with a restrictor plate with a oneinch opening in order to prevent the subsurface drain from functioning as a primary orifice a restrictor plate orifice may be increased if necessary to the smallest size required to drain the facility within the required 72 hours 22 stormwater management ponds that have a pond capture recharge or water quality component shall assume that the basin is full to the controlling component volume at the beginning of design event routing 23 stormwater management ponds must provide safe passage of the onehundredyear return period peak runoff rate assuming that all of the principal spillway orifices are fully clogged and the principal spillway overflow is 50% clogged a minimum of a sixinch freeboard must also be maintained above the resulting maximum water surface elevations wse any embankment emergency spillway may be assumed to be unclogged stormwater management ponds with embankments completely made up of natural undisturbed soils fully in cut or where roadways act as the emergency spillway are permitted however the design engineer must verify downstream stability and control 24 all pre and postdevelopment comparisons of peak flows shall be rounded to tenths of a cfs the intent here is to recognize the accuracy and precision limitations of hydrologic modeling procedures again small differences between pre and postdevelopment discharge rates should be permitted when no negative downstream impacts will result 25 the full modified puls routing method must be used for stormwater management pond analyses simplified methods of determining pond size requirements such as those in tr55  26304 ferguson code  26304 fwd776 1986 may only be used for preliminary pond size estimates the full modified puls routing method must be used for stormwater management pond analyses 26 prepackaged hydraulic programs are not approved for the analysis of underground stormwater management facilities unless it can be verified that the program rounding subroutines used for the stagestorage data do not affect the results this is because for very small storage volumes the program may round off the volume to a significant percentage 27 full supporting documentation must be provided for all stormwater management designs 28 designs must be checked for impervious area flash iaf this check is used to determine if flooding may occur due to poor modeling choices specifically related to the time of concentration this analysis requires that the watershed impervious area be modeled without the pervious areas the time of concentration should also be determined from the impervious areas only if the iaf analysis results in a higher peak runoff rate at a culvert or discharge from a pond this higher rate must be used for the final designcomparison the check will frequently yield higher values if a watersheds impervious area is located primarily near the watershed outlet or point of interest b capture volumes cv 1 to minimize nuisance flooding from small precipitation events a runoff capture volume is required for all stormwater management ponds that do not discharge directly to natural welldefined with bed and banks perennial streams in general natural welldefined streams in the spring creek basin and all of ferguson township are limited to those delineated as usgs us geological survey perennial streams this should be treated as a guideline and not a steadfast rule the final determination is at the discretion of the township engineer the pond capture volume is a volume of runoff that will be retained in a pond below the elevation of any free surface principal spillway orifice in addition to the minimum required capture volume identified within this section the capture volume may also include all or portions of the recharge volume and water quality volume see e below no principal spillway orifice except those connected to subsurface drains regardless of how small shall be below the pond elevation equivalent to this volume 2 the centre county conservation district cccd receives numerous complaints regarding ponds that are located at the downslope edge of a property that result in discharging runoff  26304 foreword  26304 fwd777 onto downstream properties in an uncontrolled manner or where no existing defined outlet channel exists this is a very common problem in areas underlain by carbonate rock these discharges can cause erosion and flooding downstream while the pond capture volume is intended to minimize some of these negative effects it cannot deter or reduce the impacts from poor design practices therefore whenever possible the cccd recommends that the designer consider the downstream morphological changes that may occur and when possible consider constructing conveyance systems to a stable natural channel in some cases this may require cooperation between landowners 3 a minimum capture volume is required to mitigate nuisance flooding from small precipitation events the minimum required capture volume is defined as a runoff depth of 025 inch from all impervious areas tributary to the stormwater management facility this volume will be allowed to infiltrate evaporate or dewater from a subsurface drain system connected directly to the facilitys principal spillway 4 the maximum capture depth shall be 24 inches note twentyfour inches is identified as the maximum depth of water recommended for infiltration facilities in the pa bmp manual appendix c protocol 2  infiltration system design and construction guidelines the township engineer reserves the right to require that the capture and peak rate control be managed in separate facilities in cases where potential sinkhole damage could cause impacts to public facilities andor offsite areas special consideration with regard to allowable capture depth and dewatering time shall be given to stormwater designs relying on total infiltration or where capture of the tenyear event or larger is proposed to be infiltrated due to site constraints on site or off site in these cases a preapplication meeting shall be held with the township engineer to identify an appropriate design capture depth and dewatering time any increase in capture depth above 24 inches must be supported by a detailed geotechnical report in support of the increased capture depth 5 supporting computations that show that 90% of the capture volume can dewater in a maximum of 72 hours must be provided the dewatering time must also provide for sufficient passive water quality treatment infiltration rates are to be maintained at less than six inches per hour unless it is demonstrated that the soils cation exchange rate is greater than five meg100 g in which case the maximum infiltration rate shall be 10 inches per hour basins outfitted with underdrains for dewatering shall incorporate an orifice at the  26304 ferguson code  26304 fwd778 underdrain outlet to maintain dewatering times as specified above 6 to simplify computational requirements for design event analysis designers do not need to calculate discharges from subsurface drains related to the capture volumes if the filter media is sand or smaller than aashto american association of state highway and transportation officials 57 stone the capture volume is to control runoff rates from impervious areas and is not related to water quality however pond designs that include a water quality volume that is greater than the required capture volume are assumed to have also met the required capture volume as long as it dewaters as required 7 designs that rely on the natural infiltration of insitu soils must provide documentation supporting the infiltration rates used for analysis infiltration rates reported in the soil survey of centre county or other published rates may be used at the discretion of the township engineer 8 the pond capture volume should always be used when upslope areas are developed where the ponds design creates a point discharge that did not previously exist 9 stormwater management detention facilities that connect directly to storm drainpipe networks discharging to natural welldefined channels do not require a capture volume c recharge volumes rv 1 the purpose of the recharge portion of the twofold first the recharge requirement is to mitigate the loss of groundwater recharge associated with the creation of impervious surfaces in addition the recharge criterion is to mitigate the increase in runoff volume associated with the creation of impervious surfaces this increase in runoff volume has significant impacts on downstream landowners these impacts are most often exhibited in the form of increased nuisance flooding and channel or drainageway erosion and instability according to local municipal engineers and representatives of the cccd these problems are of significant local concern the magnitude of these problems increases with the percentage of impervious coverage created on a site 2 recharge mitigation shall be provided for runoff from all proposed impervious areas the required recharge volume shall be computed as 05 inch of runoff from all proposed impervious areas it is noted that lined detention ponds and compacted fill areas are considered to be impervious when calculating site impervious area for recharge considerations in addition land areas covered by paver blocks pervious pavement and other structural surface treatments which  26304 foreword  26304 fwd779 permit surface infiltration may be treated as pervious areas when calculating the site impervious area for recharge considerations as long as the structural infiltration practice is supported by sound design and appropriate construction specifications the township engineer may require submission of supporting documentation prior to approving structural infiltration areas as pervious areas it must also be demonstrated that the runoff from the area directly tributary to recharge bmps will satisfy the recharge volume requirement during the oneyear twentyfourhour storm 3 the following design practices may be used as credits to reduce the recharge volume requirement a residential roof areas detached duplex and townhouse dwellings and commercialindustrial buildings with roof areas less than 5000 square feet may be removed from the computed impervious area when these roof areas are sumped to dry wells designed in accordance with the following minimum standard 1 sump design criteria to meet the recharge criteria sump storage or voids volume shall be equal to 004 cubic feet per square foot of roof area 05 inch rainfall depth if sump stone has a voids ratio of 40% the total sump volume will be 010 cubic feet per square foot of roof area when designed only to meet this recharge criteria the maximum size for a single sump is 100 cubic feet and the minimum sump surface area a to depth d ratio ad must be a minimum of 41 the sump depth less any freeboard shall not exceed 24 inches this roof sump standard shall apply unless the township adopts a separate roof sump standard for water quantity or peak control b all or portions of driveways roadways and parking areas may be removed from the impervious area calculation when sheet flow from these areas is directed to undisturbed natural bufferfilter areas or constructed filter strips this flow must be dispersed as sheet flow as it crosses the bufferfilter area sheet flow velocities should be nonerosive as they cross the impervious areafilter interface 1 to ensure proper infiltration characteristics the natural soil profile within natural bufferfilter areas cannot be disturbed during construction completely undisturbed natural recharge areas serve this function best however minor surface scaring seeding and landscaping is permitted in these areas as long as natural grades are not altered in special  26304 ferguson code  26304 fwd780 cases when approved by the township engineer minor grading combined with soil profile reconstruction may be permitted in natural buffer filter areas in addition the following standards apply to natural filterbuffer areas a natural filterbuffer areas must have a minimum width of five feet or onehalf of the impervious area drainage length immediately tributary to the buffer area whichever is greater this width is measured parallel to the direction of sheet flow b to qualify for a recharge volume credit the surface slope of natural filterbuffer areas must be conducive to recharge and not result in flow concentration or erosion to meet this intent the surface slope of the area tributary to the natural bufferfilter area and the surface slope of the natural bufferfilter area itself may not exceed 5% in special cases steeper slopes may be used if specifically authorized by the township engineer c the total impervious area tributary to a natural bufferfilter area cannot exceed twice the buffer filter area 2 to qualify for a recharge volume credit constructed filter strips shall be designed to the following standards a the minimum filter strip width shall be five feet or onehalf of the impervious area drainage length immediately tributary to the constructed filter strip whichever is greater this width is measured parallel to the direction of sheet flow b the total impervious area tributary to a constructed filter strip area cannot exceed twice the constructed filter strip area c the surface slope of the area tributary to the constructed filter strip area and the surface slope of the constructed filter strip area itself may not exceed 5% and 3% respectively in special cases steeper slopes may be used if specifically authorized by the township engineer d the filter strip surface shall consist of a minimum of six inches of natural or reconstructed topsoil with a stable grass surface treatment reconstructed topsoil designs must be approved by the township engineer prior to application  26304 foreword  26304 fwd781 reconstructed topsoil consists of soils augmented by tillage and the addition of soil amendments such as fertilizers and organic material fertilizers include any organic or inorganic plant nutrients or soil amendments organic material is any nutrient or compound containing animal or plant materials such as manure or compost e to minimize erosion of the topsoil layer during construction it is recommended that these areas be sodded however the township engineer may permit the use of an acceptable erosion control seeding application in this later case any loss of topsoil and seed must be replaced until a permanent vegetative stand is achieved c sidewalks separated from roadways andor other impervious surfaces by a grass strip of equal or greater width than the sidewalk itself may be removed from the impervious area calculation when the sidewalks are graded so that sheet flow from the walk is directed to the grass strip sidewalks with steep longitudinal slopes that themselves would act as channels during runoff events cannot take advantage of this credit a fivepercent longitudinal sidewalk slope shall be used as the benchmark defining steep slopes d impervious areas tributary to natural closed depressions may be subtracted from the total site impervious area used in the recharge volume calculation as long as a qualified geotechnical engineer or soil scientist certifies to the soundness of these sitespecific applications water quality pretreatment may be necessary prior to the direct discharge of runoff to existing closed depressions or sinkholes e impervious areas tributary to manmade closed depressions may be subtracted from the total site impervious area as long as a qualified geotechnical engineer or soil scientist certifies to the soundness of these sitespecific applications manmade closed depressions may be created use of low head berms one foot or less in height f additional credits may apply for undisturbed land areas that are known to have high infiltration capacity and that are maintained or enhanced these areas must be defined and quantified from actual site data collection 4 after credits the remaining recharge volume shall be directed to a recharge bmp such as infiltration trenches beds etc  26304 ferguson code  26304 fwd782 these facilities may be located in open areas or under pavement structures the appropriateness of the particular infiltration practice proposed as well as the design parameters used shall be supported by a geotechnical report certified by a qualified professional soil scientist geologist hydrogeologist geotechnical engineer 5 stormwater recharge requirements or credits affect stormwater management design requirements for stormwater management computations the reduction of site cns based only on a weighting type analysis as is sometimes done for cluster type developments is not permitted however for stormwater management purposes the cn for recharged areas may be computed using the nrcs method for disconnected impervious areas the actual hydrologic process that occurs within the basin must be stressed in all recharge situations 6 these recharge requirements must be met on all sites unless it can be demonstrated that recharge would be inappropriate any request for such a waiver from these recharge requirements must be accompanied by a supporting report certified by a qualified professional soil scientist geologist hydrogeologist geotechnical engineer 7 developers and site design professionals are encouraged to use a higher standard for recharge volume on sites where local site conditions do not restrict a higher standard 8 water quality sensitive wqs developments must use an acceptable pretreatment bmp prior to recharge acceptable pretreated bmps for these developments include bmps that are based on filtering settling or chemical reaction processes such as chemical coagulation if infiltration devices including subsurface exfiltration devices are to be utilized as a part of the swm design for a development in the wqs district the infiltration rate should be a maximum six inhr to allow proper soil filtrationpassive treatment of the runoff a maximum infiltration rate of 10 inhr may be used for soils with demonstrated cation exchange rates greater than five this infiltration rate may be achieved amendments or engineered soil media 9 accounting for recharge within lined stormwater management ponds is not permitted however if unlined uncompacted ponds andor depressed lawn areas are used to satisfy water quality or capture volume criteria these areas and volumes may also be used to meet recharge requirements as previously defined additional recharge volume may be credited to these areas as long as it is demonstrated by a qualified professional that recharge processes can naturally occur in these areas  26304 foreword  26304 fwd783 10 finally because this analysis is concerned with trying to adequately represent real processes that occur within the watershed there will be areas that cannot physically recharge stormwater these areas include exfiltration areas that are commonly found at the base of wooded hillsides where clay pans exist and saturation areas near major streams or floodplains these areas may not accept recharge during most runoff events these areas are exempt from recharge requirements when these conditions are documented and certified by a qualified professional soil scientist geologist hydrogeologist or geotechnical engineer in addition stormwater management techniques relying on infiltration techniques are not permitted in these areas 11 the township engineer may waive the recharge requirement in the following situations a the township engineer may waive the recharge requirement in highly developed areas or areas undergoing redevelopment where the township engineer has determined that forced recharge could have adverse impacts on adjacent landowner structures property or township infrastructure these waivers should be limited to small land areas generally less than five acres in size where the ability to place recharge beds may be limited or may hinder redevelopment b the township engineer may waive the recharge requirement in areas where a qualified soils scientist or geologist has determined that none of the site soils are suitable for recharge or that the location of the suitable soils is such that harm to adjoining properties could occur as stated under above c the township engineer may waive the recharge requirement in areas where recharge cannot physically occur as documented by a qualified soil scientist geologist or hydrologist these areas include 1 exfiltration areas commonly found at the base of wooded hillsides where clay pans or fragipans exist  and 2 saturation areas near major streams or floodplains 12 as identified above recharge analysis andor waiver requests must be supported by a geotechnical report sealed by a qualified professional soil scientist geologist hydrogeologist or geotechnical engineer the intent of this report will be to establish the suitability of a particular parcel of land or area for recharge and to identify areas on a development site appropriate for recharge it is recommended that the  26304 ferguson code  26304 fwd784 geotechnicalsoils consultant discuss the extent and approach to the analysis with the township engineer prior to initiating the field investigation at a minimum this report should include the following information a a description of the geotechnical site investigation performed including the methods and procedures used b data presentation c analysis results including the following minimum information 1 a map identifying site areas inappropriate for recharge along with supporting justification in addition to illustrating topographic features significant geologic and hydrologic features should be identified rock outcrops sinkholes closed depressions etc 2 determination of the permeability coefficient for potential recharge areas 3 determination of the infiltration capacity of natural site soils 4 location depth and permeability coefficient for any restrictive layers identified 5 soil uniformity 6 depth to bedrock in potential recharge areas and a statement reflecting the uniformity of the depth to bedrock across the site 7 a statement relating to the sites proximity to fracture zones within the bedrock 8 additional information deemed pertinent by the geotechnical engineer 9 in sensitive area districts projects shall also comply with the following requirements for a preliminary geologic investigation a a qualified professional soil scientist geologist hydrogeologist or geotechnical engineer shall review aerial photographs soils geologic and other available related data including the local public water suppliers source water protection study as the data relates to the subject property the qualified professional shall also conduct a comprehensive field view and inspection of the  26304 foreword  26304 fwd785 property and consult with the public water suppliers consulting hydrogeologist based on the above information the professional shall prepare a map of the site indicating the following i closed depressions ii open sinkholes iii outcrops of bedrock iv surface drainage into ground v ghost lakes after rainfall vi lineaments faults and fracture traces vii limonite excavations and quarries b based on the map prepared above and in conjunction with other mapping and available information the geologist shall prepare a report on project suitability and the impact potential on the groundwater resource of the water quality sensitive areas the report shall demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this chapter including any recommended mitigating measures designed to ensure compliance c in addition infiltration facilities shall be located greater than 50 feet from any critical geologic features identified in the geotechnical report or geophysical testing report unless the reports provide for approved mitigating measures that will produce no negative impact on groundwater recharge or quality 10 if the preliminary geologic investigation identifies a significant potential for sinkhole formation or where soil and subsurface conditions may not be suitable additional geologic investigations may be determined to be necessary this determination will be at the discretion of the township engineer the additional investigations and analysis may include electrical resistivity tomography or other similar types of geophysical testing a detailed report of the geophysical testing along with recommendations for avoidance of sinkholeprone areas shall be included in the stormwater management site plan d recommendations for any special design considerations necessary for the design of recharge systems on the site for example required soil depth over bedrock  26304 ferguson code  26304 fwd786 appropriate surface grades over recharge areas appropriate hydraulic head over recharge areas alternative siting increased use of decentralized and nonstructural swm techniques andor remediation recommendations must be included in the report e justification as to why the site should be developed to a high impervious density if the site has adverse soil and geotechnical limitations which prohibit the ability to induce natural recharge explanation how these limitations will not create the potential for undue harm to the environment and the spring creek watershed or other any area in ferguson township when the site is developed f where it has been shown that recharge cannot be performed and a waiver of the recharge requirements is being requested the township shall require that the first one inch of runoff from all new impervious areas be treated facilities these facilities may include underdrained basins rain gardens and infiltration trenches treatment is to include use of an amended topsoil to provide filtration of the stormwater all underdrain outlets are to include a restrictor plate to prevent the underdrain system from functioning as a primary outlet 13 the following guidelines apply to the use of subsurface exfiltration bmps often incorrectly referred to as engineered infiltration bmps a soils shall have minimum infiltration rates as specified in  26304 if no site soils have percolation rates meeting these standards subsurface exfiltration bmps shall not be used b a minimum of 30 inches of soil shall be maintained between the bottom of a subsurface exfiltration bmp and the top of bedrock or seasonally high groundwater table the upper surface of a layer of saturated material in the soil unless a qualified geotechnical engineer provides documentation supporting a design depth less than 30 inches and the minimum depth is approved by the township engineer c if the minimum percolation rate is not met andor the minimum soil depth cannot be maintained on a site recharge should be accommodated by directing shallow sheet flow from impervious areas across surface filter strips andor undisturbed natural areas or some other innovative surface infiltration feature should be used limiting subsurface percolation rates andor depth to  26304 foreword  26304 fwd787 bedrock shall not by themselves warrant a recharge waiver 14 in addition since recharge is intended as a volume control innovative or new methods that address the significant increase in the volume of runoff from sites having large impervious areas are encouraged these volume control alternatives may be used only if they can be shown to function with the original intent engineering and science the final determination of original intent shall always be the right of the township engineer d storm drain conveyance system design storm drainage conveyance systems consist of storm sewer pipes swales and open channels computational methods for design of storm drain conveyance systems shall be as follows 1 recommended computational methods models for storm drain design are based on site or watershed drainage area as follows size model up to 200 acres rational method between 200 acres and 15 square miles hec1 psrm tr20 over 15 square miles psuiv with the carbonate adjustment factor at the discretion of the township engineer other methods as approved by the township engineer such as swmm swirmroute etc 2 rational coefficients used are to be from rawls et al 1981 padot design manual 210 or using the aron curves appendix a table 367 to convert cns to c for previously disturbed or newly disturbed pervious areas runoff coefficients should be appropriately adjusted to reflect an increase in runoff associated with the loss of natural soil structure if the aron curves are used cns must also be adjusted to reflect the loss of soil structure in disturbed areas by reducing the hsg as identified by the nrcs by a minimum of 1 hsg level for example if the natural hsg designation is b an hsg of c should be used for disturbed soils these disturbed area adjustments to hsg levels do not apply to 67editors note appendix a is included as an attachment to this chapter  26304 ferguson code  26304 fwd788 minimally disturbed areas the design engineer may choose to use the following rational c coefficients without regard to soil hsg for small sites however it is recommended that they be used only for storm drains up to 24 inches in diameter the use of these conservative values shall fully be the choice of the design engineer all impervious areas c   095 all pervious areas c   030 3 storm drains shall be designed at a minimum using a tenyear runoff event without surcharging inlets storm drains tributary to a multiple site stormwater management facility across township roads or crossing other properties must convey at a minimum a twentyfiveyear runoff event without surcharging inlets runoff events in excess of the indicated design event must be conveyed safely downstream 4 inlets on grade cannot assume a sumped condition for hydraulic modeling ie top of inlet casting set below pavement surface in parking areas 5 the township engineer may require the analysis of the onehundred year peak runoff rates for conveyance purposes in some instances where regional stormwater management facilities are employed 6 any storm drain within state or federal rightsofway or one that falls under the design criteria of any higher authority must meet the requirements of that agency in addition to the minimum requirements of this chapter 7 the time of concentration tc may be computed by any method which best represents the subject watershed however the nrcss segmental method is not recommended for use with drainage areas that are predominately undeveloped and are greater than 100 acres in size the nrcs lag equation or another more appropriate method

limitations for use are specified in the restrictions section for each credit the township engineer may require additional documentation or investigation prior to use of each specific credit to reduce the risks of sinkhole development or groundwater contamination for sensitive areas and development types no area may be double counted for use with credits the combined credits of natural area conservation and vegetated filter strips is limited to 50% of the sites impervious area the drainageway credit is limited to 50% of the sites impervious area the drainageway protection credit is limited to 50% of the sites impervious area the maximum total water quality credit for any site may therefore be 100% of the sites impervious area  26304 ferguson code  26304 fwd794 nonstructural

water quality credit is given for the protection of natural drainageways on a development site natural karst drainageways within the spring creek watershed and ferguson township often do not exhibit a defined channel bed and banks more often these drainageways appear as wide shallow parabolic swales these drainageways are an integral part of the natural drainage system and often exhibit significant infiltration capacity protection of these drainageways is critically important to the health of the watershed b the drainageway protection dwp area is defined as an area centered on the drainageway and having a width equivalent to the onehundredyear flow spread the township engineer may modify the defined minimum width in cases where natural landforms define an appropriate alternate width c the

areas without pretreatment 5 natural area conservation a water quality credit is given for natural areas that are conserved at the development site thereby maintaining predevelopment water quality characteristics the impervious area used in the wqv equation for the development site may be reduced by the natural area conserved in the water quality volume computations natural area conservation is different than vegetated filter strip recharge area and drainageway protection in that in some cases surface runoff may never be directed over the natural area ie if upslope wooded areas are conserved a restrictions on the credit 1 natural areas must remain in an undisturbed condition during and after construction activities temporary incidental land disturbance activities associated with utility

flow 2 untreated urban runoff from sensitive development types may not be directed to natural areas without pretreatment 6 filterbuffer area a water quality credit is given when stormwater runoff is effectively treated via a filterbuffer area or strip a filterbuffer area is a vegetated boundary characterized by uniform mild slopes filter strips may be forested or vegetated with turf grass effective treatment is achieved when impervious area runoff is directed as sheet flow across vegetative filter or buffer areas ie concentrated flow discharged to a filter strip does not meet water quality reduction criteria the area draining via overland sheet flow to an undisturbed natural vegetated filter strip natural unmaintained meadow or forested area may be subtracted from the site impervious area ia on a  area ratio in the water quality volume computation impervious areas draining across constructed disturbed or regarded pervious areas may be subtracted from the site impervious

not permitted for water quality sensitive wqs developments 6 the maximum total water quality credit for vegetative filterbuffer areas is 50% of the site impervious area however the combination of nac and filterbuffer areas is also 50% b sensitive area and development restrictions 1 untreated urban runoff from wqs developments may not be directed to filterbuffer areas without pretreatment 7 comments related to water quality credits a concurrence of the township engineer is required prior to the use of all water quality credits for the reduction of the water quality treatment volume the township engineer may approve the use of additional credits based upon sufficient documentation regarding suitability for sensitive development types and areas pollutant removal effectiveness and maintenance criteria multiple water quality credits cannot be claimed for the identical area of the site ie a stream buffer credit and disconnecting roof recharge area cannot both be claimed for the same area b additional impervious coverage reduction using lowimpact development techniques development practices which reduce the impact of urban runoff such as narrower residential road sections smaller culsdesac smaller parking stalls smaller building setbacks to reduce  26304 ferguson code  26304 fwd798  26305 erosion and sedimentation requirements  62016 driveway lengths etc will also reduce the required water quality treatment volume many of these techniques require prior approval by the township before implementation into land development design f infiltration test requirements infiltration testing shall be performed in accordance with the current version of the pennsylvania stormwater best management practices manual and as outlined here 1 double ring infiltrometer methods

not be constructed nor receive runoff until the entire contributory drainage area to the bmp has received final stabilization 3 adequate erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels and at all points of discharge 1 the use of sinkholes for stormwater management must be carefully planned because discharging runoff directly into existing sinkholes is not an engineered stormwater solution aside from potential water quality effects cover collapse sinkholes that exist throughout the watershed can be unstable and it should be assumed that they could stop taking water at any time numerous sinkholes throughout the region already flood during larger runoff events nonetheless in the watershed there are large drainage areas that completely drain to existing sinkholes and all upslope development tributary to them cannot be realistically stopped therefore the following sections have been developed a stormwater from roadways parking lots storm sewers roof drains or other concentrated runoff paths shall not be discharged directly into sinkholes without prior filtration in accordance with  26306 below b sinkholes capable of absorbing substantial amounts of stormwater shall be protected by diverting such runoff around the sinkhole refer to  or upon recommended approval of the township engineer by planting and maintaining a dense filter path of suitable vegetative

accordance with the manufacturers recommendations or may be constructed by mixing bentonite or an approved alternative with existing soil available at the site as approved by the township engineer f if it is determined that runoff from upslope developing areas should be diverted around a sinkhole due to existing problems the township engineer may require additional upstream volume controls as

geotechnical engineer however where a liner is deemed necessary or appropriate the use of controlled compacted natural clay liners for stormwater management basins should be considered locally available clay when properly installed can provide near impervious conditions approximately e6 cms or less some of the advantages of using controlled compacted natural clay soil liners are 1 can offer better longterm solution as a basin liner versus geosynthetics because of greater thickness and the ability to withstand settlement  2 can be constructed to allow relatively uniform leakage rates to facilitate groundwater recharge but not to an excessive degree that overloads karst bedrock  3 when properly constructed in two or more eighttoten inchthick lifts rapid movement of surface water clay liner is eliminated rapid leaks can occur in geosyntheticlined basins due to poor seaming punctures or other factors   26307 ferguson code  26307 fwd806 4 cleaningmaintenance of claylined stormwater basins will be easiersafer versus geosynthetic liners which could easily be damaged during maintenance operations  and 5 the abundance of clayey soils derived from limestone residuum within the spring creek watershed can provide adequate cost effective soil resources for construction of clay liner systems at most development projects b however the installation of any lowpermeability clay liner

along the arterial corridor 1 the ridge overlay district requirements are intended to provide land use and land use development controls along specified ridge corridors in the township as an overlay that is supplemental to the underlying rural residential zoning district regulations if a conflict exists between the regulations of this section and the underlying rural residential zoning district regulations the more restrictive requirements shall apply a intent many of the soils present in the overlay zone including some of those identified as colluvial are rated by the soil survey of centre county as having severe limitations for uses such as septic tank absorption fields dwellings with basements and local roads and streets the soil survey prepared by the united states department of agriculture soil conservation service indicates that a rating of severe means soil properties are so unfavorable and so difficult to correct or overcome as to require major soil reclamation special designs or intensive maintenance the limitations associated with the colluvial soils include a seasonal highwater table fragipan soil stability steep slopes slow permeability large stones and frost action it is the intent of the ridge overlay district requirements set forth hereinafter to restrict the intensity of development on areas containing a predominance of colluvial soils with severe limitations and 1 to identify the location of the most severe soil areas where development is not appropriate  2 to minimize the potential for damage from erosion sedimentation and flooding  3 to protect the property of the township and future homeowners from adverse conditions  and 4 to protect and retain natural resources especially surface water and groundwater resources within the township b delineation of ridge overlay district the ridge overlay district requirements shall be applied in the areas depicted on the officially adopted zoning map of ferguson township c criteria for

structure in the ridge overlay zoning district  27401 ferguson code  27402 fwd926 1 soils no land disturbance which would involve the construction of a habitable structure the installation of a paved driveway or construction of roads which are used for access to a dwelling unit or units may occur on andover buchanan laidig or other soils defined as colluvial by the centre county soil survey andor nrcs digital soil survey other than in accordance with the provisions of  27402 2 10 below or conditional use process provided for in paragraphs  27402 which follow a although the centre county soil survey may be used as a resource extensive onsite soils investigation and testing will be required to determine the actual soil distribution on each site any property or site within the overlay district mapped with or potentially containing severely rated colluvial soils or inclusions thereof must be evaluated prior to being permitted for the land disturbance activities noted above in order to accomplish the soils evaluation work the developer must meet with the townships engineer to determine at a minimum the location number and type of soil test pits that will provide a representative sample of the soils present within the area intended to be disturbed consensus on the number of test pits will be reached based on the landowners development intentions soil mapping units delineated in the centre county soil survey andor the nrcs digital soil survey the location of natural features on the site and any previous soil test results this will provide the data necessary to prepare a detailed soils map of the site that will allow the applicant to determine the potential to provide roads driveways andor structures in accordance with these regulations the purpose of requiring testing of each parcel is to allow for consideration of the variety of property sizes the location of salient natural features and the full range of permitted development options for those properties or sites where the above required soils investigation definitively indicates that the proposed land disturbance activities will not be impacted by the location of colluvial soils the remainder of the requirements of this district shall not be applicable 1 no excavation or fill that will cause any slope to become unstable  impose loads that may affect the safety of structures or slopes  interfere
