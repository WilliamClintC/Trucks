adjacent roadways or change the number of trips entering and exiting the site bthe development will affect another mode of travel bicycle pedestrian busses etc 2a tier 2 standard tis is required when a development meets the following criteria athe development produces 100 or more peak hour trips or 750 or more daily trips bthe development is expected to reduce the level of service on adjacent roadways andor intersections to below a level of service of c ca level of service lower than c already exists on an adjacent roadway dthe development is within 500 feet of a highaccident intersection

terms of safety capacity and speed every roadway in a transportation network has a specific function which can be broadly stated as either to provide direct access to abutting land or to provide for movement in this context it can be stated that the effects of access management become significant in the case of freeways arterial streets and collector streets where there needs to be a balance between movement and the access functions performed by the roadway 1in order to promote safe and reasonable access between public roadways and adjacent land improve the convenience and ease of movement of travelers on public roads and permit reasonable speeds and economy of travel while maintaining the capacity of the roadway the location and design of access points shall be in accordance with the access management regulations as outlined in the manual of design these regulations shall apply to all existing planned or proposed roadways within the jurisdiction of the city new or proposed roadways within the city not identified on the adopted street master plan shall interconnect with the existing roadway network in a uniform and efficient manner 2even though existing roadways and their accesses do not comply with the respective access restrictions in their class for the prevention of the future breakdown of the balance between mobility and access functions it is required that the city follow the regulations for all future access permits 3when direct property access wherever allowable is permitted to any roadway the developer shall bear the cost of the corresponding roadway improvements required to meet the restrictions defined by the access level of the respective roadway 4the engineering and environmental services director shall be responsible for the uniform
