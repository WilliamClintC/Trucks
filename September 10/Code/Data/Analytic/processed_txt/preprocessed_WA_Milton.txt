findings of fact based on public testimony and other evidence presented to it the city council on february 199 makes the following findings of fact by adoption of athe secondary effects of the activities defined and regulated in this chapter are detrimental to the public health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city and therefore such activities must be regulated studies and reports from other jurisdictions relied upon include the  report by federal way city attorney londi k lindell to the federal way mayor and councilmembers and the summary of land use studies from 13 other jurisdictions copies of which are attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter as exhibits a and b bregulation of the adult entertainment industry is necessary because in the absence of such regulation significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred this history of criminal activity in the adult entertainment industry has included prostitution illegal employment of minors narcotics and alcoholic beverage law violations breaches of the peace tax evasion and the presence within the industry of individuals with hidden ownership interests and outstanding arrest warrants cproximity or contact between entertainers and patrons during adult entertainment performances or between patrons in panorams and adult motion picture theaters can facilitate sexual contact prostitution and related crimes concerns about crime and public sexual activity are legitimate and compelling concerns of the city which demand reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments in order to protect the public health safety and general welfare dthe activities described in subsections b and c of this section occur in the absence of regulation regardless of whether the adult entertainment is presented in conjunction with the sale of alcoholic beverages eit is necessary to license entertainers in the adult entertainment industry to prevent the exploitation of minors to ensure that each such entertainer is an adult and to ensure that such entertainers have not assumed a false name which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible fit is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of establishments offering adult entertainment at such times as such establishments are offering adult entertainment so that there will at all necessary times be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the adult entertainment establishment including the actions of patrons entertainers and other employees gthe license fees required in this chapter are necessary as nominal fees imposed as necessary regulatory measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the city in regulating the adult entertainment industry hhidden ownership interests for the purposes of skimming profits and avoiding the payment of taxes have historically occurred in the adult entertainment industry in the absence of regulation these hidden ownership interests have historically been held by organized and whitecollar crime elements in order for the city to effectively protect the public health safety morals and general welfare of its citizens and effectively allocate its law enforcement resources it is important that the city be fully apprised of the actual ownership of adult entertainment establishments and identities and backgrounds of persons responsible for management and control of the adult entertainment establishment iit is not the intent of this chapter to suppress or censor any expressive activities protected by the first amendment of the united states constitution or of the washington state constitution but rather to enact time place and manner regulations which address the compelling interests of the city in mitigating the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments jin an undercover operation in 199 police officers entered the deja vu live adult entertainment establishment in neighboring federal way washington over an approximately fivemonth period approximately 24 criminal violations were charged for acts occurring while the officers were inside deja vu police officers repeatedly observed managers ignoring criminal law violations committed inside deja vu within a short distance from the manager managers would look at the

severability  findings the city finds as follows athe city had established a moratorium on the issuance of additional licenses by the state gambling commission of social card games conducted as a commercial stimulant for the purposes of studying its effects and to receive public input  and bthe city has reviewed the effects of casinos and gambling in other communities in the nation and received public input at its public hearings  and cduring the public hearings both the general public and operators of social card games conducted as a commercial stimulant provided input to the city council  and drcw  authorizes municipalities to prohibit certain gambling activities otherwise authorized  and eafter receiving public input and being advised of the action taken by neighboring municipalities the city deemed it to be in the public interest and welfare to prohibit certain social card games as defined in rcw   and fthe state legislature in amendments to the state gambling act allowed certain enhanced card rooms which are commonly referred to as minicasinos  and gas a result of this authorization there has been established a number of minicasinos in the south king county and pierce county regions  and hthere are adverse effects as the result of the establishment of the minicasinos which include but are not limited to perceptions by residences and business of the negative effect that such minicasinos would have and therefore do not desire to have a residence or a business in the same municipality where such exist  and iunder the growth management act gma the city is required to infill and provide high density development within its boundaries and the establishment of minicasinos could be adverse to attracting occupants for such developments  and jthe establishment of minicasinos is not in harmony with the comprehensive plan as it has a negative effect on the attraction of business and residential development into the urban area  and kprohibiting social card games conducted as a commercial stimulant is an exercise of the citys police powers pursuant to legislative authority per rcw  and in the best interest of the general health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city  and lthis chapter has no adverse environmental effect  and mthis chapter is in harmony with the comprehensive plan   prohibition in accordance with rcw  the

court as provided in rcw din passing upon such applications the hearing examiner shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and 1the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and 11the cost of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges eupon consideration of the factors of this section and the purposes of this chapter the hearing examiner may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter fthe building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal insurance administration upon request    1997   1990  variances  conditions agenerally the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing mmc d1 11 have been fully considered as the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases bvariances may be issued for the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set forth in this section cvariances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result dvariances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief evariances shall only be issued upon 1a showing of good and sufficient cause  2a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  3a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in mmc d or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances fvariances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare gvariances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dryfloodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria except subsection a of this section and otherwise complies with mmc  and  hany applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation    1990  abrogation and greater restrictions this chapter is not intended to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed
