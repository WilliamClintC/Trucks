san clemente california municipal code 1996 ____________ a codification of the general ordinances of san clemente california ____________ beginning with supp no 21 supplemented by municipal ____________ preface the san clemente california municipal originally published by book publishing company in 199 has been kept current by regular supplementation by matthew bender & company inc its successor in interest beginning with supplement no 21 municipal will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 21 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a subjectmatter index with complete crossreferencing locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers ordinances included in supp no 50 update 2 adopted 1672 642019 1673 5212019 1674 642019 1675 6182019 this supplement brings the to date no 1675  passed  municipal capital circle sw tallahassee fl 32310 8002622633 how to use your code this code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials city employees and private citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by number section if applicable and year example  1992 beginning with supplement no 21 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end these history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list

with subjects not normally codified such as budgets taxes annexations or rezones the disposition will be special if the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code usually at the direction of the municipality the disposition will be not codified other dispositions sometimes used are tabled pending number not used or missing beginning with supplement no 21 this table will be replaced with

city of dana point b  socwa is governed by its own board of directors board with each director representing a member agency ma mas join together in various project committees to construct and operate joint sewerage facilities the socwa ocean outfall is the key facility in the socwa system treated wastewater is discharged to the outfall from socwa other mas and the cscs wastewater treatment plant c  socwa is the lead agency responsible for the implementation of the provisions contained in the ordinance codified in this chapter the csc a ma of socwa may opt to administer and enforce these provisions under socwas oversight or may contract with socwa to have these services provided to the csc an interagency agreement has been adopted between the csc and socwa that defines each agencies duties and responsibilities this interagency agreement is on file at both the csc and socwa offices  1262011   objectives a  the objectives of this chapter are to 1 ensure compliance with various regulatory agencies and certain national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes requirements  2 prevent the introduction of pollutants that may cause interference of sewerage facility operations  3 identify the goals objectives and procedures for complying with federal pretreatment standards  4 prevent biosolids contamination  5 promote the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters or biosolids from sewerage facilities  6 encourage waste minimization and material substitution by users 7 protect sewerage facility employees and the general public who may be affected by wastewater biosolids and chemical hazards  8 encourage the reuse recycling and reduction of water wastewater or solids that are discharged to sewerage facilities  9 minimize the discharge of volatile organic compounds that could individually or collectively contribute to a decrease in the quality of air emission from sewerage facilities 10 establish an effective monitoring program for the control of user discharges to sewerage facilities  11 establish an enforcement response plan erp  12 equitably allocate costs  13 prevent the introduction of pollutants into sewerage facilities that may pass sewerage facility inadequately treated into the receiving waters or otherwise be incompatible with sewerage facilities  14 incorporate the necessary laws and regulations in order to implement and enforce federal state of california state csc and socwa standards  15 seek to identify users that discharge or have the potential to discharge toxic pollutants noncompatible or excessive amounts of compatible wastes to sewerage facilities  1262011   purpose a  the purpose of this chapter is to 1 provide for the maximum public benefit from the use of csc andor socwa sewerage facilities this is accomplished by regulating the use of sewerage facilities and wastewater discharges by providing equitable distribution of costs in compliance with applicable state and federal regulations and by providing procedures that will allow the csc andor socwa to comply with requirements placed upon them by other regulatory agencies any revenues derived from the application of this chapter may be used to recover the cost of providing services by the csc andor socwa which include but are not limited to administration monitoring and enforcement 2 comply with federal and state regulations which allow the csc andor socwa to meet applicable standards for the final effluent and ocean outfall quality this chapter establishes quality and quantity limitations on all wastewater discharges whether or not the discharges adversely affect the cscs andor socwas sewerage facilities processes ocean outfall effluent quality or inhibit the cscs andor socwas ability to meet its specific discharge limitations it is the intent of this chapter to improve the quality of wastewater being received for treatment and to encourage water conservation by all users connected to a sewerage facility it is the cscs andor socwas intent to discourage the increase in quantity mass emission of waste constituents being discharged this chapter also imposes pretreatment requirements on the degree of waste authorized to be discharged to the cscs andor socwas sewerage facilities provides for the issuance of wastewater discharge permits or other controlling mechanism to impose additional casebycase requirements as appropriate and establishes fees and other penalties for noncompliance and for violations of this chapter  1262011   policy a  the policy of this chapter is to be 1 interpreted in accordance with the

section  is being added to of the san clemente municipal administrative provisions to better define when a building permit will not be issued for construction of a new building or structure an addition or alteration that increases the interior square footage of an existing building or an alteration of an existing building in a way that reduces the stability of the land upon which the building or structure is located this code addition is made due to the general findings listed below i topographical conditions a natural slopes of 15 percent or greater generally occur throughout the city the elevation change caused by the hills creates the geological foundation on which communities within the city are built and will continue to be built with much of the populated flatlands within the city already built upon a higher proportion of future growth is likely to be proposed and occur on steeper slopes with greater constraints in terrain ii geological conditions a the city is a densely populated area that has buildings constructed over andor near a vast and complex network of faults that are believed to be capable of producing future earthquakes similar or greater in size than the 1994 northridge and the 1971 sylmar earthquakes earthquake faults run along the northeast and southwest boundaries of orange county the newportinglewood fault located within orange county was the source of the destructive 1933 long beach earthquake 63 magnitude which took 120 lives and damaged buildings in an area that ran from laguna beach to marina del rey to whittier in december 198 another earthquake occurred in the city of irvine at an unknown fault line regional planning for earthquakes is recommended by the state of california department of conservation b road circulation features located throughout the city also make these amendments reasonably necessary there are major roadways highways and flood control channels that create barriers and slow response times hills slopes and street and storm drain design accompanied by occasional heavy rainfall cause roadway flooding and landslides and at times may make an emergency access route impassable c expansive soils throughout the city combined with predominant hillside conditions ancient landslides groundwater and occasional flooding raise the potential for ground slippage ground erosion slope failure and building damage   solar energy permits for small residential rooftop solar systems a intent and purpose the intent and purpose of this section is to provide for an expedited streamlined solar

the uniform building hillside development of the uniform building further amended by adding the hillside development regulations to be known and cited as the city of san clemente hillside development  to read as follows in of this chapter a42   purpose and intent the purpose and intent of the hillside development regulations is to implement the goals objectives and policies of the general plan including the land use element the conservation and open space element and the seismic safety element relating to the preservation and maintenance of the natural character and amenities of hillsides as a scenic resource of the city and relating to protection from geologic hazards regarding unstable soils prevention of erosion and the like a43   applicability a  the provisions of the hillside development regulations shall apply to all areas located within the development dd district as established by the city zoning to all areas within the dd district for which specific plans have been approved except these regulations do not apply to that portion of the dd district which is designated as the development district coastal dc on the general plan land use element map b  the hillside development regulations are primarily intended for application in connection with the site plan review process however certain regulations are identified for application in connection with the specific plan process or the tentative subdivision map process refer to 2924 of the zoning applicability to the hillside development ordinance1 regarding specific plans and site plan review respectively approval of a specific plan tentative subdivision map or site plan in accordance with all applicable laws rules and regulations shall constitute a final approval of the developments conformity to the requirements of the hillside development to such approval a44   definitions a  primary ridgelines are those natural preservation ridgelines designated as such on the city general plan open spaceconservation map these ridgelines possess the greatest prominent public visibility from existing and undeveloped portions of the city these ridgelines shall be preserved in their natural state as a means of maintaining community character exceptions shall be granted only to accommodate general plan designated trails general plan designated circulation components viewpoints fuel modification measures or other requirements needed to implement the goals and objectives of the general plan or to meet the provisions of public health safety and welfare b  secondary ridgelines are those ridgelines designated as such on the city general plan open spaceconservation map these ridgelines possess a significant amount of public visibility but are less prominent than primary ridgelines a45   considerations a view and the viewer 1 hillside development is more visible than flatland level terrain development therefore the hillside development regulations are designed to make hillside development as visually pleasing as possible 2 panoramic views from hillside roads and public places are as important to the character and amenities of the community as views facing the hillside development the provision for view opportunities for all residents and visitors plays an important role in creating a positive character for hillside communities b camouflage 1 quality hillside development blends manmade and manintroduced factors with the natural environment therefore architecture and landscape shall be harmoniously integrated into the natural environment see exhibit a in appendix to this chapter 2 compatible architecture responds to the natural environment incorporating sloped terrain into development rather than eliminating such terrain therefore the scale form and surface expression of architecture shall either blend with or complement the character and textures of the hillside 3 compatible landscape like architecture responds to the natural environment vegetation shall be compatible with and responsive to the environmental conditions of the development site therefore vegetation planted within a developed area creates the theme and character of the community and shall blend and unify the architecture c compression  conforming to the gradient of a slope forces development into a more vertical living environment such compression limits the utilization of many flatland development concepts compact development shall be maintained such as clustering and minimizing setbacks thereby minimizing grading and making development less

temporary and portable structures only  part 2002   variance procedure a nature of variances  the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning laws that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  part 2002   appeal board a  the city council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter b  the city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination of this chapter c  in passing upon such applications the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in others of this chapter and 1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges d  any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $25 for one hundred dollars $100 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county of orange recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land e  the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency f  generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvements and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf  acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing items listed in subsection c of this section have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf  acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases g  upon consideration of the factors of subsection c of this section and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter h  the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal insurance administration upon request  part 2002   conditions for variances a  generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf  acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of b and c of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf  acre the technical justification required for issuing the various increases b  variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation or restoration of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c  variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d  variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this ordinance for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local

natural topography by encouraging residential structures that follow the topography of the lots on which they are located and by discouraging significant grading or fill on infill lots the calculation of height by individual roof element is intended to assist these objectives by allowing roof elements to step up or down with the natural topography of the lot the measurement of height from original grade is also intended to assist these objectives by establishing height limits which are relative to the natural topography  2 accommodate the special difficulties of developing on sloped properties by allowing height to be averaged within roof elements  3 encourage developments with full roofs the establishment of a height limit to plate line and a height limit to top of roof in specific mixeduse and nonresidential zones where traditional architecture is required is intended to assist with this objective  and 4 discourage excessively massive structures the establishment of a story limit in mixeduse and nonresidential zones is intended to assist with this objective the exemption of subterranean portions of structures from counting toward the story limit is intended to assist this objective as well b general regulations for the measurement of height the following regulations for calculating height shall apply to all development within the city of san clemente 1 measurement

overlay districts and standards   purpose and intent the general plan establishes a number of overlay designations for the city these designations are to be used along with underlying landuse designations such as residential commercial mixeduse and openspace designations also established in the general plan overlay districts signify that an area or site has been identified to have distinct characteristics requiring special development standards or guidelines beyond those for the underlying zoning designation the general plan details the goals objectives and policies for areas with the overlay designations which are meant to be used along with the goals objectives and policies for the underlying zoning designation for an area it is the purpose of this chapter to implement the general plans vision for the overlay districts regulations and guidelines specific to each overlay the goals for each of the overlay districts is provided with a description of the district in the following section  part 1996   architectural a overlay district a purpose and intent  the purpose and intent of the architectural a overlay designation is to signify a visually distinct district in san clemente containing structures characterized by two significant design orientations 1 the citys traditional architectural style spanish colonial revival and 2 a pedestrian orientation the goals for areas with this designation are as follows to 1 maintain and enhance the unique spanishvillagebythesea character of specific areas of the city  2 maintain a high quality of design consistent with the citys history according to the general plan urban design element and citys design guidelines  3 require new buildings and major remodels be designed to reflect the citys spanish colonial revival except for a projects on properties along north el camino real between west avenida palizada and calle los bolas and on south el camino real between avenida rosa and interstate5 that may have spanish colonial revival architecture or a true form of another spanish architectural style such as mission monterey or mediterranean b remodels of architecture of historically significant buildings with distinctive architecture other than spanish colonial revival these remodel projects are required to preserve and reinforce the character defining features and other aspects of the site and buildings design that are architecturally significant and distinct 4 when spanish colonial revival architecture is required the goal of the a overlay is to require site and structural development that exemplifies the ole hanson era and at the same time allow creative interpretation of spanish colonial revival architecture if this section requires architecture other than spanish colonial revival the goal of the a overlay is to require site and structural development  that is consistent with the citys design guidelines and in character with the architectural style required by the a overlay 5 provide for the development of commercial and mixeduse integrating commercial with residential districts characterized by a high level of pedestrian activity  6 require that structures be sited and

of buildings and improvements fronting north el camino real otherwise projects may use existing architecture c distinctive architecture of historically significant buildings projects shall preserve and reinforce the original architectural design of structures that are designated historic resources eligible for historic listing or potential eligible for historic listing this includes significant structures with distinctive architectural styles that include but is not limited to spanish colonial revival art deco postmodern and midcentury modern project should reinforce the buildings original

designated historic eligible for historic listing or potential eligible for historic listing this includes significant structures with distinctive architectural styles other than spanish colonial revival such as art deco postmodern and midcentury modern project should reinforce the buildings original architectural design 4 remodeled structures although the ultimate goals for remodeled buildings in the architectural overlay are to have the required architectural style per subsection e above it may not always be practical with minor changes to convert a contemporary building into a true form of the required architectural style consistent with the citys design guidelines or to provide pedestrianoriented elements it is not the intent of the architectural overlay district to prevent minor building improvements additions maintenance etc from occurring the following should be considered when remodeling a building a in reviewing additions to existing buildings which do not have the required architectural style andor not pedestrianoriented the review authority shall determine whether or not it is practical for the existing buildings to be converted to a true form of the architecture required by this section andor to provide pedestrianoriented elements b in cases where only minor modifications are proposed the goals shall be the following i to improve the architectural quality of the building consistent with the architectural style required by this section  ii to include design elements that are in character with the required architectural style where practical  iii to include as many pedestrianoriented elements such as courtyards paseos outdoor eating areas landscaping interesting architectural details etc as is practical minor modifications are changes that leave the existing building essentially intact and are primarily cosmetic eg paint restucco enlarged windows small additions minor remodels are required to comply with the standards of the underlying zoning designation and the general design guidelines in the citys design guidelines if the building being remodeled is spanish colonial revival or if spanish colonial revival elements would complement the building and are practical then the section of the citys design guidelines pertaining to spanish colonial revival architecture should be used to guide minor changes when practical the guidelines for pedestrian districts contained in the citys design guidelines should also be used c for all major remodels projects shall have the required architectural style per subsection e and pedestrianorientation unless it can be demonstrated that it is impractical to do so major remodels are changes that significantly alter a buildings design eg additions that significantly change the footprint of the building the addition of new stories new roof design etc major remodels are required to comply with all relevant sections of the citys design guidelines particularly the section for pedestrian districts as well as the development standards for underlying zoning designation if spanish colonial revival architecture is required major remodels are also required to comply with relevant sections of the citys design guidelines for spanish colonial revival architecture  2007   2006   part 1996  4 5152018   central business cb overlay district a purpose and intent  the central business cb overlay is also known as pedestrian p overlay in the general plan and as the visitor serving commercial district vscd overlay in the coastal land use plan the purpose of the central business district cb overlay designation is to signify core commercial and mixeduse districts in which the city will require pedestrian uses to be located in pedestrian spaces on the street level of

coastal visitorserving commercial recreational dining and lodging uses and provide new areas for such uses it sets aside certain commercial areas to ensure adequate sites to accommodate the provision of additional new visitorserving commercial and lodging development in the coastal zone this goal is to be achieved by reviewing all uses requiring discretionary review for their appropriateness in pedestrian spaces the city recognizes that the market for pedestrian uses in the cb overlay fluctuates and as such provides this discretionary review process for the approval of nonpedestrian uses in pedestrian spaces as the market for pedestrian uses increases in the cb overlay area the approval of nonpedestrian uses in pedestrian spaces should diminish b applicability  the provisions in this

the potential aesthetic impacts of boats trailers and oversized vehicles that are parked outside the required driveway and that are visible from the street the regulations in this subsection are meant to result in fences walls and hedges that partially block the view of boats trailers and oversized vehicles from vantage points along streetside property lines of the property on which the boat trailer or oversized vehicle is parked the intent of this subsection is to require partial and not full screening from both vertical and horizontal perspectives of the boat trailer or oversized vehicle the screening required by this section is partial from a vertical perspective because most boats trailers and oversized vehicles exceed the maximum height of the fence wall or hedge required in this subsection the screening required by this subsection is partial from a horizontal perspective because 1 this subsection requires screening from views along the streetside property line of the subject property not along the entire street  and 2 this subsection does not require that fences walls or hedges be 100 percent opaque the city recognizes the desirability for aesthetic purposes of allowing a variety of opaqueness and materials to be used to satisfy the fence wall and hedge requirements 2 standards all boats trailers and oversized vehicles shall be partially screened by fences

complies with all the provisions of this section 3 modifications to the minimum height for partial screening the minimum fence wall or hedge height for partial screening may be reduced to 42 inches with the approval of the community development director if the community development director determines that all of the following conditions are met a the boat trailer or oversized vehicle is located on an area of the lot which does not permit fences over 42 inches in height in accordance with the height limits for fences walls and hedges found in b standards  and b location of the boat trailer or oversized vehicle to an area of the lot which would allow partialscreening that is six feet tall would be impractical or economically infeasible that is it would impose costs on the applicant which are excessive in light of the purchase costs of the boat trailer or oversized vehicle  and c the applicants inability to satisfy the minimum height requirements for partial screening is not the result of the applicant maintaining his or her property in a manner which renders it impossible to satisfy the requirements of this section  1999  part 1996   tandem parkingresidential uses duplexes which

study area 1 purpose and intent the parking waiver program for the downtown parking study area is designed to serve the unique characteristics of this area which influence parking demand the parking study area contains a significant number of public parking spaces which absorb the overflow parking from private parking lots and substitute for private parking in addition the existing mix of land uses is varied with retail and office uses public services serviceoriented businesses and some residential uses the variety of land uses in the area the incorporation of residential uses into commercial projects the varied peak parking demand periods that they create their proximity to one another and the pedestrianorientation of the area result in a shared or jointuse of the available public parking all of these factors reduce the parking demand from that experienced by many types of commercial areas a parking study completed in 199 on which this program is partially based confirmed the unique parking circumstances in the downtown parking study area the parking waiver program was developed to address the reduced parking demand experienced within the study area the program has been designed so that waivers are not automatic  rather they require discretionary action on the part of the city waivers are to be granted based on the availability of public parking near the proposed project and on the projects contribution to the pedestrian atmosphere of the downtown parking study area the availability of private parking near a project is not a basis for granting waivers in the development of this program the city recognizes that each block within the parking study area is unique with its own set of circumstances related to public parking availability parking
