neighborhoods located within close proximity to adult theaters bookstores and other adult uses experience increased crime rates sexrelated crimes in particular lowered property values increased transiency and decreased stability of ownership  c the adverse impacts which adult uses have on surrounding areas diminish as the distance from the adult uses increases  d studies of other cities have shown that among the crimes which tend to increase either within or in the near vicinity of adult uses are rapes prostitution child molestation indecent exposure and other lewd and lascivious behavior  e the city of phoenix az study confirmed that the sex crime rate was on the average 500 percent higher in areas with sexually oriented businesses  f many members of the public perceive areas within which adult uses are located as less safe than other areas which do not have such uses  g studies of other cities have shown that the values of both commercial and residential properties either are
