microwave or any other form of telecommunication signals b purpose and intent the telecommunications act of 1996 as amended on  sets forth provisions concerning placement location and construction of towers and related facilities for communication the purpose of this section is to establish general guidelines for the siting of wireless communication facilities which include antenna structures in order that such towers not cause visual pollution or create a safety hazard or reduce property values on adjacent properties reasonable regulations for the location use of existing structures eg water towers school and church steeples tall buildings design of structures and towers is appropriate wireless communication facilities are specifically determined to not be essential services nor to be public utilities as such terms are used in this intent of these provisions is to encourage users of towers to 1 protect land uses from potential adverse impacts of wireless communication facilities 2 place the location of new wireless communication facilities in nonresidentialzoned areas 3 minimize the total number of wireless communication facilities throughout the community 4 strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing wireless communication facilities sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional singleuse wireless communication facilities 5 locate them on cityowned water towers where feasible and to the satisfaction of the city 6 configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the wireless communication facilities design siting

state highway is to move traffic city of manistee filer township manistee township little river band of ottawa indians reservation and to points beyond studies of motorists traveling along this segment of us 31 indicate however that a very high percentage of the traffic has an origin or destination in the city townships or reservation thus us 31 also has a secondary but important function to provide access to adjacent and nearby land uses the need for this overlay district is based in part on specific studies for us 31 that conclude the road is in need of improved access management the roads capacity is insufficient to accommodate volumes in the future continued development along the corridor will increase traffic volumes and introduce additional conflict points which will further erode traffic operations and increase potential for crashes numerous published studies and reports document the positive relationship between welldesigned access management systems and traffic operations and safety those reports and experiences of other communities demonstrate that implementing standards on the number and placement of access points driveways and side street intersections can preserve the capacity of the roadway and reduce the potential for crashes while providing a good business environment the standards set forth in this based on recommendations published by various national and michigan transportation agencies that were refined during preparation of the us 31 corridor improvement plan the city of manistee finds that special comprehensive standards are needed along the us 31 corridor based upon the following findings a the combination of roadway design function arterial highway traffic speeds current and projected traffic volumes traffic crashes and other characteristics necessitate special access standards b studies by transportation organizations in michigan and nationally have found a direct correlation between the number of access points and the
