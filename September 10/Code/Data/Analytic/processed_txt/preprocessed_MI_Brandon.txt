includes slopes in excess of 15 percent between these elevations these elevation changes and slopes shall appear as the predominant feature of the site rather than the exception or infrequent feature of the site b mass grading of the site would be necessary in order to achieve the maximum road grade permitted by the county road commission and the use of cluster housing development will allow for a greater preservation of a desirable natural setting 3 the parcel contains substantial portions of floodplain and wetlands as verified by a floodplain and wetlands map issued by the appropriate federal state county or township agency or prepared by a qualified wetlands consultant 4 due to the size and shape of the parcel utilization of the cluster lot option would result in the more creative and

the general regulations h collocation requirements 1 statement of policy it is the policy of the township to minimize the overall number of newly established locations for wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support structures within the community and encourage the use of existing structures for attached wireless communication facility purposes consistent with the statement of purpose and intent set forth in subsection a of this section each licensed provider of a wireless communication facility must by law be permitted to locate sufficient facilities in order to achieve the objectives promulgated by the united states congress however particularly in light of the dramatic increase in the number of wireless communication facilities reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of the change of federal law and policy in and relating to the federal telecommunications act of 199 it is the policy of the township that all users should collocate on attached wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support structures in the interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this section as stated above and as stated in subsection a of this section if a provider fails or refuses to permit collocation on a facility owned or otherwise controlled by it where collocation is feasible the result will be that an additional structure will be compelled in direct violation of and in direct contradiction to the basic policy intent and purpose of the township the provisions of this subsection are designed to carry out and encourage conformity with the policy of the township 2 feasibility of collocation collocation shall be deemed to be feasible for purposes of this section where all of the following are met a the wireless communication provider entity under consideration for collocation will undertake to pay market rent or other market compensation for collocation b the site on which collocation is being considered taking into consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a facility is able to provide structural support c the collocation being considered is technologically reasonable eg the collocation will not result in unreasonable interference given appropriate physical and other adjustment in relation to the structure antennas and the like d the height of the structure necessary for collocation will not be increased beyond a point deemed to be permissible by the township taking into consideration the intent and purpose of this chapter and the several standards contained above 3 requirements for collocation a a special land use permit for the construction and use of a new wireless communication facility shall not be granted unless and until the applicant demonstrates that a feasible collocation is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs b all new and modified wireless communication facilities shall be designed and constructed so as to accommodate collocation c the policy of the township is for collocation thus if a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility shall fail or refuse to alter a structure so as to accommodate a proposed and otherwise feasible collocation such facility shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use and shall not be altered expanded or extended in any respect d if a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility shall fail or refuse to permit a feasible collocation and this requires the construction andor use of a new wireless communication support structure the party failing or refusing to permit a feasible collocation shall be deemed to be in direct violation of this chapter and contradiction of the policy intent and purpose of this section and consequently such party shall be prohibited from receiving approval for a new wireless communication facility within the township for a period of five years such a party may seek and obtain a variance from the zoning board of appeals if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance relief which in this context means a demonstration that enforcement of the fiveyear prohibition would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent wireless communication services or that such enforcement would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless communication services 4 incentive review of an application for collocation and review of an application for a permit for use of a facility permitted under subsection h3a of this section shall be expedited by the township i removal requirements 1 a condition of every approval of a wireless communication facility shall be adequate provision for removal of all or

development or a creative reuse of an old large existing facility is necessary in order to protect the surrounding area protect the environment andor protect the health safety and welfare of the community as a whole the regulations outlined in this article allow for the establishment of puds in all zoning districts or in all land use plan designations as a viable land use development alternative for the purpose of the following 1 preserving a natural resource 2 encouraging innovation in land use development planning 3 creating a unique combination of land uses that would be a benefit to the township as well as to the applicant 4 encouraging the development of lands that are compatible with its character and adaptability 5 providing for quality housing new local employment special shopping opportunities safe traffic patterns and better recreational facilities for the residents of the township b the provisions of this section therefore provide the regulatory authority and outline the standards for the submission review and approval of a pud  901 application of regulations the following regulations are applicable to all puds and they will become the basis for reviewing puds in all steps of the review and approval process 1 applications for planned unit developments may be submitted for review in all zoning districts 2 any land use or a combination of land uses authorized in this chapter may be included in a planned unit development provided adequate site improvements are incorporated into the plan to protect the occupants in one land use from the effects of adjacent land uses within the pud or in land uses adjacent to the pud so that public health safety and general welfare are protected 3 the pud shall be under single ownership or under the control of a single entity until the project is completed in conformity with this chapter if any landownership interests change notice shall be given to the township within ten days of such change 4 the pud must demonstrate that one or more of the following conditions will occur a that a local state or national resource andor natural feature of a substantial quantity andor a significant quality will be protected or preserved  b that some clearly defined unique benefit or innovative planning pattern will accrue to the users of the pud andor to the township as a whole that would not be otherwise feasible or not likely to be achieved without the use of the pud designation  c that a higher quality of living working andor leisure activity will be acknowledged within the township  or d that an existing nonconforming use of the land in the zoning district in which it is situated at the time of an application for a pud will be transformed into a more conforming or less offensive situation in some significant way 5 the proposed type and density of the use incorporated in the pud shall not cause an undue burden upon public services facilities and utilities than what would otherwise occur under separate land use situations that would have been permitted by other sections of this chapter 6 the proposed pud shall not place an undue burden on the natural environment within the development or on the surrounding parcels 7 the proposed pud shall not result in excessive noise or traffic in the surrounding area nor shall it result in a reduction in pedestrian safety within or around the development 8 the proposed pud shall not result in an unreasonable and quantifiable negative economic impact upon surrounding properties and in fact the applicant should demonstrate how properties and property values are protected or are possibly increased in value and how the quality of the life in the surrounding properties are protected or enhanced  902 designs standards for a pud the following regulations are applicable to all puds based upon the types of uses to be incorporated into a pud and the intensity of the development of a pud 1 residential use and density a residential density shall not be greater than the maximum density permitted in the zoning district in which the property is situated immediately prior to classification under this article if the parcel is not zoned for residential use immediately prior to classification under this article the township shall make a determination as to appropriate density based upon existing and planned residential densities in the surrounding area the availability of utilities and services and the natural features and resources of the subject parcel b project density shall be demonstrated by a preliminary site plan with a conventional layout and with all applicable ordinances and laws observed including proof of water supply and sewage disposal as set forth in this section c an applicant shall demonstrate that all dwelling units proposed within a planned unit development are capable of meeting applicable county andor state agency approvals for onsite water supply and sewage disposal where such onsite systems are proposed inasmuch as the capability of the parcel for onsite water supply and sewage disposal is material to the determination of potential development density the township shall require percolation tests soil borings and other information to determine suitability of soils for onsite sewage disposal these tests must be conducted under the supervision of a registered engineer certified sanitarian or other competent licensed professional in accordance with uniform procedures established by the state department of environmental quality and this chapter a preliminary site plan with a conventional layout is required in order to demonstrate project density the planning commission may recommend to the township board to waive the requirement for percolation tests soil borings and other information on each individual lot of the preliminary site plan with a conventional layout when it can be demonstrated by the applicant that one or more of the following conditions exist 1 conducting the necessary testing would result in unreasonable damage to significant natural resources and features that are intended to be preserved 2 previous studies acceptable to the planning commission have been conducted on the site which verify the suitability of soils and subsurface conditions for onsite water supply and sewage disposal 3 other evidence and data exists which in the opinion of a registered engineer certified sanitarian or other competent licensed professional and such evidence is acceptable to the planning commission verifies the suitability of soils and subsurface conditions for onsite water supply and sewage disposal d additional density for residential uses may be allowed by the discretion of the township board upon the recommendation of the planning commission and based upon a demonstration by the applicant of consistency with the master plan and of planning and design excellence resulting in a material benefit to the township adjacent land uses andor the ultimate users of the project where such benefit would otherwise be unlikely to be achieved without the application of the pud regulations in the determination whether a project warrants additional density the township board may also consider the following factors including without limitation innovative design  pedestrian or vehicular safety  longterm aesthetic beauty  protection and preservation of natural resources and features  preservation of open space which avoids fragmentation of the resources base and contributes to an area wide open space network  and improvements to the townships infrastructure 2 mixed use projects for planned unit development projects which contain a residential component the township shall make a
