the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts see eg findings of us department of health and human services sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films the findings noted in subsections b1 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and will prevent the further secondary effects of dissemination of illegal obscenity child pornography and to minors materials harmful to them it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity the fact that an applicant for an adult use has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter the barring of such individuals from employment in sexually oriented businesses for a specified period of years serves to prevent distribution of illegal material to prevent conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases and to preclude the establishment of criminal enterprises within the city the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter  372 definitions for purposes of this
