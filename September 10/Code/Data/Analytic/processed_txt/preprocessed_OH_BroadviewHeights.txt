principles established in this chapter are intended to be fundamental principles to be applied with professional skill in the planning of land so as to produce attractive and harmonious neighborhoods convenient and safe streets and economical layouts of residential and other land development bsince these provisions are principles instead of specific regulations as set forth in other chapters it may not be possible to incorporate all the principles in each subdivision especially in small developments however the planning commission shall determine if certain principles are not applicable alternate designs should be thoroughly studied to obtain the best plan to assure stable and high value neighborhoods cif a comprehensive plan thoroughfare plan or plan for the parks and other open areas has been adopted the streets school sites public parks and all other land uses shown thereon shall be incorporated in the subdivision plan passed 5201963  124602 topography subdivisions shall be planned to take advantage of the topography of the land in order to utilize the natural contours and economize in the construction of drainage facilities to reduce the amount of grading and to minimize destruction of trees and topsoil the natural features and other distinctive characteristics of the site shall be integrated into the plan to create functional variations in the neighborhoods topographic maps shall be utilized in land planning astreets and topography land shall be planned so that the streets follow the natural drainage courses and as many lots as possible shall be above the street grade where it may be necessary because of limitations of site dimensions to plan streets approximately perpendicular to the contour lines more extensive grading shall be required bnatural drainage subdivisions shall be designed particularly land of very gentle slopes to take every advantage of natural grades so that all the land can be drained without excessive grading unless watercourses or drainage ways are enclosed the plan shall be adjusted so that rear lot lines are approximately parallel to the natural or straightened course and only where such a plan is not possible may side lot lines be arranged parallel to an open drainage course easements for drainage ways and low lying land which is subject to flooding may be included as part of a lot but shall not be used as a building site but may be included in calculating the required lot area or width cnatural features natural features irregularities changes in the level of brooks lakes hilltops and other focal points

planned for continuation of existing streets in the system at the same or greater width in accordance with adopted city standards major streets shall contain as few intersections as possible 2where a subdivision of onefamily dwellings adjoins a major street the commission shall require the developer to prepare sketches and estimates of a plan based on marginal access streets or some other treatment such as the fronting of lots on perpendicular local streets in order to protect the residential property from the movement of heavy traffic and to eliminate driveways cutting into a major street and it may require a plan wherein lots do not have direct access onto the major street or it may require a setback of such depth that marginal streets can be constructed in the future bsecondary streets these streets function to collect traffic from local streets and to distribute it onto major streets as such they will normally contain a relatively large number of intersections with local streets and few intersections with main streets unless shown otherwise on the thoroughfare plan a secondary street system may be required wherever a residential neighborhood surrounded by major streets is over 150 acres in area or where the local street pattern is so designed as to converge and serve over 500 onefamily dwellings and for any multifamily development secondary streets shall be planned for continuity and to lead more or less directly to one or more focal points or centers of traffic generation and may become bus routes clocal streets 1these streets provide direct and full access to each lot they shall be planned for convenient circulation toward the principal directions of travel bus routes schools and playgrounds the layout shall be related to the topography

extensions to the boundaries of the development to provide circulation between adjoining neighborhoods 2culdesac or permanent deadend streets are permitted only where parcels are isolated by surrounding allotments where continuous streets would require excessive grading because of very irregular or unusual topography such as a promontory or terrace land formation for more effective utilization of land or where other types of nonwould not provide sufficient discouragement of if the culdesac is not open in the direction of schools or playgrounds a pedestrianway shall be provided

future extension of the street and utilities and so noted on the final plat enonconforming widths where property abuts a street which does not conform to the width required by thoroughfare plans of the city county or state transportation department or these regulations the additional width shall be dedicated when such land is subdivided streets of less than the required width shall not be permitted except where the commission finds that such a street will be adequate to serve the partial development until all abutting property is subdivided freserve strips adjoining streets these strips or other provisions to control access or extensions to pavement andor utilities to a nearby property shall not be permitted except where the control and disposal of land comprising such strips has been assigned to the city under conditions approved by the commission gstreets for multifamily developments these streets shall be planned to connect with major or secondary streets so as not to generate large volumes of traffic on local residential streets vehicular and pedestrian access shall be planned so that a street service drive parking area or delivery area will be located not more than 100 feet from every main or service entrance of a building and available for each dwelling unit all other applicable planning principles shall apply to the design of multifamily developments

development guidelines standards and regulations to allow development of a mix of assembly mercantile office service public residential and related uses as well as major public open spaces that together will function as a focal point and gathering center for the entire community key objectives are to retain a sense of place to have more humanscale and pedestrianoriented environment avoid strip development along arterials  focus commercial activity into discrete nodes and to increase connectivity it is desirable to have places that encourage informal casual interactions and meetings these spaces are found in the public realm such as sidewalks paths and within open spaces or in parks as well as a variety of shopping areas the developer shall use these objectives to create a flexible and innovative site design for a traditional town center bguiding principles for future development include 1emphasize royalton and broadview roads as the major eastwest and northsouth transportation corridors for the town center and establish the broadview and royalton roads intersection as a major focal point for the district 2develop focal points at the end of the proposed town center loop roads to visually anchor the street and reinforce the desired quality and character that will allow it to be successful as a dynamic retail and commercial district this can be accomplished use of decorative paving landscaping or other architectural elements 3design internal circulation to encourage pedestrian interaction and activity by providing wide sidewalks numerous small gathering places and interesting landscape and hardscape 4establish gateways or an appropriate town center entry experience identity at the boundaries of the town center district create an spd district identity use of consistent signage street graphics lighting and landscaping 5develop opportunities for a variety of multifamily residential housing types primarily focused on market rate for sale product

parcel numbers is included at the end of this passed 1222013  128306 development guidelines ageneral requirements 1intent of the spd this section describes the general characteristics of development to meet the overall intent of the spd one of the most challenging tasks is to provide connections between different areas and uses the following categories must be incorporated refer to  128304 for a schedule of permitted buildings and uses for both zone a district tlspd1a and zone b district tcspd1b 2activity center areas adescription activity centers consist of a core focus area with shopping services recreation and office and institutional facilities and support areas activity centers are the most critical element of the spd activity centers are characterized by a distinctive identity and a compatible mix of activities and facilities along with functional and aesthetic unity bpurpose of area 1to have all of the essential facilities for the community concentrated in one convenient location the focus area  and 2to provide community focal points and open space and be fully connected to adjoining neighborhoods in the support area and surrounding neighborhoods cneighborhood activity centers neighborhood activity centers provide facilities to serve the daily needs of one or more adjoining neighborhoods this one convenient location contains small scale facilities such as a supermarket a drug store service stations small offices and a day care center dcommunity activity centers community activity centers serve a wider area and therefore are larger and more diverse than neighborhood activity centers they can contain such facilities as a large supermarket large drug store large chain retaildiscount store specialty shops service stations places of worshipreligious assembly parks midsize offices and perhaps a school eregional activity centers regional activity centers serve an entire region regional shopping malls a number of major employers  restaurant and entertainment facilities  and a high school or community college  are the kinds of facilities that anchor regional activity centers regional centers take up the most land have the most diverse uses and are the most intensely developed of the three levels of activity centers 3office parks and transitional office areas adescription office parks are planned concentrations of office development these areas accommodate additional office growth outside of activity centers they include space for example for large firms or those that by size or function are incompatible with the residential office and commercial uses in activity centers office parks have primarily office uses such as corporate offices bpurpose of area office parks provide space for substantial employment centers they accommodate uses that do not fit the compact pedestrian orientation of activity centers office parks are unified developments often in campuslike settings with an internal road network and shared open space the buildings generally relate to each other and share design characteristics 4other nonresidential use areas not in activity centers or office parks adescription these sites provide isolated commercial office and institutional uses that may not fit into activity centers or office parks examples include miscellaneous uses such as veterinary clinics furniture stores and vehicle dealerships these are the categories of nonresidential development 1commercial uses outside of activity centers  2office and institutional uses outside of activity centers  3industrial uses outside of activity centers  4commercial lowintensity uses  and 5transitional office uses these categories can be applied to infill sites and at the intersections of some arterials not designated as activity centers bpurpose of area the purpose of these areas is to accommodate the wide range of miscellaneous uses that do not logically fit into activity centers or exist outside of activity centers for other reasons 5corridor conversion and redevelopment areas adescription if corridors in the spd are slated for redevelopment primarily because of roadway widenings these expanded roadways can cause significant changes and challenges for the adjoining sites many of which may contain existing singlefamily dwellings their continued residential use may be obsolete due to the impact of the widened corridor and must be incorporated into the overall development plan bpurpose of area this category identifies areas that likely will undergo changes the intent is to provide guidance for new uses or designs or adaptations that serve the function of the area and needs of individual property owners 6circulation adescription circulation includes all of the elements that connect places in the community streets  pedestrian walks and paths  bicycle routes  public transit  and streetscape features bstreets the hierarchy of roads in the spd is as follows 1arterials are the primary highvolume multilane routes central business district broadview and royalton roads  2collectors carry traffic between arterials from lowerorder roads to arterials and are in the major routes within a development they also form a secondary network of crosstown connectivity  and 3local streets carry traffic from destinations to collector roads they include cul desacs loop streets and alleys cpedestrianvehicular movement 1all streets must be designed with a strong sensitivity to pedestrianvehicular movement  2provide more than one route between most destinations using streets of varying sizes and types assure that future development and redevelopment provides a more connected street system  3for major arterials that handle large volumes of traffic aprovide frequent collector roads connecting arterials and developments  blimit local street and driveway access points instead provide frequent collector streets that in turn provide access to local roads  cavoid using continuous center twoway turning lanes  and dprovide planted medians wherever possible 4where arterials enter activity centers provide atreatments to announce arrival at activity centers such as decorative lighting special landscaping and plazas  btraffic calming devices to slow traffic such as street trees paving changes or pedestrian crosswalks  ccollector streets between developments for a secondary means of crosstown connectivity and for alternate routes between destination points  davoid having individual developments connect to arterial roads only  and ewhenever possible link to or extend existing or planned arterials collectors and local streets 5provide street system of collectors and local streets that aprovides multiple access routes to arterial and other collector streets  bhas a logical pattern  callows direct connections to adjoining developments  dconnects outparcels  and eaccommodates pedestrian and bicycle access 6provide local streets within developments that keep to the minimum required widths and number of lanes in order to slow traffic and maintain pedestrian scale reduce the use of culde sacs alternative designs to the conventional culdesac can make connections while still limiting traffic and providing privacy consider the following specific options aloop roads and circuitous these types of roads allow residents two means of egress off of a local street but because of their limited access and size discourage some smaller scale developments could use singlelane versions of these street types allowing more green space and less roadway  bconsider using alleys in smalllot residential areas and in commercial sites to provide access to service areas while retaining the visual integrity of the facades  cadapt culdesac streets to provide where topographically feasible at least one additional connection to the development such as a pedestrian pathway andor bike path consider limiting the paved turn around area of culdesacs with a landscape island  and drefer to for street rightofway widths street paving widths and construction requirements dpedestrian routes the pedestrian network includes sidewalks designated road crossings offroad paths and shared bicycle paths 1provide where feasible unbroken pedestrian routes between developments place paths in a logical pattern where people will want to walk place sidewalks on both sides of streets  2within developments identify a complete pedestrian pathway system linking all buildings green spaces and other destinations design with emphasis on pedestrian convenience and safety  alink buildings to the public sidewalk and to each other as appropriate  badd walkthroughs in parking lots  cprovide crosswalks in front of building entrances  dprovide breaks in large building masses to allow pedestrians to pass particularly centers  eplace special emphasis on connecting to pedestrian pathways that link schools transit recreation areas and other major destinations  fplace sidewalks throughout residential areas  gplace sidewalks on both sides of streets whenever possible  and hinclude offroad walking paths that will provide direct routes between destinations if the roadside sidewalks cannot provide direct access 3at busy intersections between major pedestrian destinations between shopping centers and their parking and at midblock points where feasible employ techniques to signal a pedestrian zone both to the automobile and the pedestrian these techniques include acrosswalks that are slightly raised  bcrosswalks that are a material other than asphalt and are textured  ccrosswalks that are wide at least ten feet  dbulbout corners that reduce the length of the crosswalk for the pedestrian 4design sidewalks appropriately for the site and the expected amount of foot traffic in commercial areas where foot traffic is expected sidewalks should be a minimum of ten feet sidewalks in residential areas can be six feet and under depending on the type of street and size of road 5provide pedestrian pathsbike connections between streets especially to connect culdesacs and at midblock points ebicycle routes 1bicycle routes include adesignated bike paths  bshared pedestrianandbike facilities such as greenways paths and sidewalks  and constreet bike lanes 2it is a goal to conveniently and safely provide bicycle connections between most destinations aprovide for bicycle traffic along major commuting corridors and between major destinations with particular emphasis on connecting residential areas to schools recreation areas and activity centers  bprovide new bike paths to connect to planned or existing municipal paths or paths of adjoining developments  cprovide facilities to store or lock bicycles at appropriate sites including schools major recreation areas transit stations office parks public institutions and activity center focus areas  and ddevelop an easily identifiable marking system of signs and road markings to designate bicycle routes and crossings fpublic transit 1public transportation routes to be incorporated to include buses vans and other services as follows acontinuous street networks with frequent connector streets provide the best environment for transit systems  and bsidewalks are necessary to connect transit stops with destinations 2along potential transit routes primarily along major commuting arterials and collector streets plan for transit stopsbus pullover sites ain particular provide sites at activity centers and major commercial developments  bprovide sites close to the entrances of major destinations such as industrial and office parks  cprovide sites at entrances to residential developments particularly medium and highdensity residential developments  and dlocate sites at pathway connections and parkandride lots 3ensure that the width and design of the roads can accommodate pullover and turning movements of the transit vehicle anticipated these specifications will vary depending on the type of transit used  4provide a sign system for pedestrians bicyclists and transit users  and 5include amenities appropriate to the projected boarding sites at major stops include shelter from the weather seating bike storage areas signs and information boards newspaper stands trash receptacles and lighting 7streetscape environment astreetscape is the general term applied to all of the elements that make up the public realm surrounding thoroughfares street paving  sidewalks  planting strips  lighting  traffic signals  outdoor street furniture  public signs  and utilities streetscapes act as connective outdoor space and help to weave a common community fabric streetscape elements lend to human scale contribute to a sense of place and help to link destinations such as 1sidewalks along the edge of buildings where there is retail and commercial activity  2treelined sidewalks and paths that provide enclosure  and 3paving materials and landscaping that give texture and visual definition to public spaces balong arterials that connect activity centers to each other or to other major developments use street trees streetlights planted medians underground utilities and other features to strengthen the visual and physical link between destinations ensure that all site distance requirements are met as plans are made cannounce gateways to activity centers and possibly neighborhoods with distinctive streetscape elements these can include signs special paving at crosswalks grouped plantings fountains and other signature features din activity center cores use coordinated streetscape elements to give the area a distinctive identity these elements can be repeated but perhaps spaced less frequently as developments move away from the center of the activity center pedestrianscaled lighting may be spaced more frequently and have more powerful illumination to allow higher light levels as development moves out to residential areas lighting may be less intense with wider spacing but the same light fixture could be used likewise taller auto oriented lights used on arterials approaching activity centers can use similar pole and base design as pedestrian lights in activity centers ein residential settings provide street trees sidewalks paths and pedestrianscaled lighting to fit the style of architecture of the development provide planting strips that are in proportion to street width and type for instance planting strips along arterials may be wider than planting strips along residential local streets coordinate strips with utility requirements as well fcoordinate the total visual effect of all streetscape elements within a development or along an arterial or major collector including paving sidewalks street trees and plantings lighting traffic signals signs street furniture and utilities develop and use a common palette of colors materials and design gcoordinate streetscape elements of individual developments with adjacent developments while they need not match they should coordinate and not clash 8parking adescription automobiles are a valuable part of everyday life and provisions must be made for them wherever people live work and play at the same time every effort must be made to address how parking can be adequate convenient but unobtrusive breduce the scale of parking break parking lots into modules or multiple smaller lots using techniques such as the natural topography logically placed landscaped pedestrian paths to destinations and by linear aisles of plantings avoid large expanses of asphalt  2reduce the amount of parking lots methods as providing onstreet parking using offsite parking such as municipal lots sharing parking among complementary uses providing pullin spaces in front of shops and creating overflow lots these techniques may require some flexibility when applying parking standards  and 3consider parking structures in highdensity areas such as activity centers to create closer knit development and reduce parking impacts use attractive architectural designs csite a portion of parking out of view 1site a minimum of 20% to 40% of parking to the rear and sides of buildings  2limit the amount of parking between the street and principal buildings oriented to streets such as outparcels in shopping centers to no more than one double row of nosein parking between the building and the street to which it is oriented  and 3screen parking lots from the street and from adjoining development using low fences or walls berms or yearround landscaping refer to for fence regulations dreduce the visibility of garages 1avoid allowing a garage to become the primary architectural feature when a home is viewed from the street especially for smalllot and attached housing  2orient garages for townhouses and very small lot detached homes to the rear avoid placing them on the first floor front facade  3consider placing the garage behind the building setback preferably facing to the side or rear of detached homes  4consider placing garages and parking in the rear with alley access  and 5consider ways to reduce overall visual impact such as placing driveways sideby side on adjoining lots eaccommodate pedestrian needs around parking areas 1provide clear pedestrian paths and crossings from parking spaces to main entrances and the street  and 2plan parking so that it least interferes with appropriate pedestrian access and connections to adjoining developments fprovide landscaping within parking areas 1separate parking aisles with medians planted with shade trees along the length of the islands include pedestrian walkways with medians to reinforce connectivity and separate pedestrians from vehicular traffic  2avoid isolated islands of single trees in general provide landscaped tree aisles between every other row of cars  and 3use shade trees of sufficient number and size at maturity to shade a substantial portion of the lot consider orientations that would provide the greatest shade during summer months smaller more decorative trees can be used closest to buildings gstandard parking spaces shall be regulated by  128404 handicapped spaces shall meet ada regulations as required by the ohio building city zoning foot wide spaces are permitted but ninefoot wide spaces are preferred in order to minimize the area of pavement needed for parking areas angled parking may be permitted if in compliance with  128404 unless noted otherwise for a number of parking spaces required refer to  128405  9building setback and arrangement abuilding setback and arrangement are critical elements for creating the kind of community envisioned for this spd they create spaces for pedestrians to move and congregate as well as for parking and they create continuity between developments building arrangement and setbacks help establish an architectural presence at important intersections they are defined as follows 1setback is generally the space between a building and the property line 2building arrangement refers to the way that buildings are oriented to each other and to the street and how they are sited and arranged on a parcel 3unless noted otherwise in this chapter refer to planning principles for setback requirements barrange buildings to help define the street to frame corners to encourage pedestrian activity and define spaces particularly at activity centers 1minimize setbacks at major intersections so that the architecture can define the area  2use compact building arrangements when a project is close to a core of an activity center to reduce the feeling of seas of parking  encourage pedestrian activity to define space  and 3strive for contiguous building arrangement along the street face and avoid large breaks between buildings csite new buildings so that they relate to adjoining buildings and developments 1if existing buildings front the street new buildings should have a similar orientation  2relate setbacks of new construction to setbacks of existing buildings or developments  3orient a portion of shopping centers to adjoining neighborhoods and to local streets leading into the adjoining neighborhoods  4provide breaks in large developments and building masses to allow pedestrian connections between developments  and 5avoid orienting service areas toward primary elevations of adjoining developments dlimit setback variation to 20% of average setback of existing development on a street for both residential and nonresidential development  earound common open space use buildings to define edges and provide a comfortable scale  and fchoose building arrangements that offer an attractive termination of vistas 10landscaping alandscaping in an urban environment has many roles it provides scale and enclosure  it provides shade and buffers  and it creates cool inviting gathering places in commercial districts and residential areas alike it can reinforce connections between neighborhoods as well as being the barrier to unsightly views battempt to maintain existing topography and plantings in new development 1use indigenous species appropriate for site conditions  2along thoroughfares and corridors preserve a treesave zone of natural vegetation or add significant landscaping in the core of activity centers street trees and more formal urban plantings may be more appropriate  3in residential areas attempt to provide significant tree cover using species that will provide a canopy at maturity when feasible incorporate mature trees into subdivision and lot design  4on commercial and office sites include trees shrubs and other landscaping to provide beauty as well as shade and screens for parking pedestrian gathering places and for screening utilities and other service areas  5in pedestrian zones use street trees to provide shade and enclosure  and 6when feasible incorporate mature specimen trees into streetscape subdivision and site design cprovide natural areas in development plans 1incorporate existing vegetation and large specimen trees into site design to the extent possible  2consider reserving from development such features as mature woods and riparian areas  3use storm water control ponds to create new parklike settings or natural areas within a development take measures such as creating pathways around the ponds and adding landscaping to enhance the parklike setting generally avoid fencing around ponds  however in some cases limited architectural fencing of modest height may be included to enhance the parklike setting unless noted otherwise in this chapter refer to for fence regulations  and 4use trees and other landscaping features to help enclose spaces such as parks and gathering places ddetailed landscaping plans must be submitted to the planning commission by the developer for review and approval plans will include landscaping strategies for the public areas as well as public open spaces such as the intersections of streets major parking lots outdoor recreation areas and all other items noted above in this section 11fences and walls afences and walls are to be used to define edges along major roadways and property lines and to provide screening when landscaping alone is insufficient built edges range from fences in neighborhoods to brick walls defining enclosure for office parks bwhen walls or fences stretch longer than 50 feet use designs with texture and modulation to provide a regular rhythm without being monotonous for example use vertical piers generally spaced no more than 25 feet apart of a different material or width or height landscaping shall be used in conjunction with a wall or fence to break up a long expanse cwhen a wall is an integral part of an office or commercial development project use materials from the material palette of the project dfence design along major roadways should be aesthetically pleasing and can be made of a variety of materials wood stockade chain link and other utilitarian fences along major roadways are not permitted eunless noted otherwise throughout this chapter refer to for fence regulations 12utilities alocate utilities so that they have the least negative visual impact from the street and adjoining development when multiple sides of a building have entrances or are highly visible electrical transformers and utilities must be screened ball utility lines structures parking areas and service areas must be direct burial at depths required by applicable codes and regulations 13service areasscreening aall service areas must be screened from view from a public street or public parking area ba building mass portion of a building mass garden wall landscaping or an ornamental fence with landscaping are among the methods that can be used to screen a service area cdumpsters transformers generators and other mechanical units must be screened from view from a public street or public parking area using the methods described above drooftop equipment does not need to be screened if it is located so that it cannot be seen from a public street or parking area escreening does not need to occur at the point of access to a service area 14noise barriers asite noisegenerating features away from neighboring properties especially residences or use barriers or other means of reducing the impact bplace mechanical equipment for nonresidential buildings so that they have minimum impact on adjacent residential uses cplace noisegenerating utilities on rooftops where possible screen them from view along major thoroughfares and from neighborhoods and parking lots 15exterior lighting aprovide appropriate exterior lighting for the particular use and area  blight pedestrian areas with ten to 14foot pedestrian scaled designed poles  cprovide pedestrian lighting at transit stops and along paths to parking lots and other destinations  dprovide extra lighting and electrical hookups at gathering areas  eprovide lighting under arcades  fprovide lighting of intersections in high traffic areas this type of general lighting can be provided from taller poles with more powerful lights in high pedestrian use areas provide lower pedestrian level lighting this situation may occur at the core of activity centers in particular  gcoordinate the lighting plan with the landscaping plan to ensure pedestrian areas are well lit and that any conflict between trees and lighting is avoided  havoid using building accent lighting that is too bright and draws too much attention to the building reasonable levels of accent lighting to accentuate architectural character are recommended  ithe developer must submit an ornamental polemounted light fixture or wallmounted light packs to the planning commission for approval pedestrian area location and spacing of light poles should be consistent with existing ordinances of the city for all other conditions relating to street lighting per the lighting must be of the style of the beacon urban luminaire or other similar style approved by planning commission  jparking areas and service areas must be lit with ornamental lighting poles up to 25 feet in height  kbuilding wall lights may be used to illuminate parking areas at the approval of the planning commission  and llighting levels refer to for a schedule of footcandle requirements 16signs afollow the general guidelines for signs as identified in unless noted otherwise throughout this chapter bcoordinate the colors and styles of signs within each development area  ckeep signs to the minimum number and size necessary for each development area  and dplace signs for both automobile traffic and pedestrians in areas that will not obstruct visibility 17open spaces aopen spaces include preserved natural areas parks plazas playgrounds squares greens and yards attractive and convenient outdoor spaces must be provided throughout the spd for everyday use special events passive enjoyment and as an attractive visual backdrop for the community bin activity centers office parks and other nonresidential areas open space provides areas for gatherings events and functions such as dining or meetings in other parts of the spd open space may be used for recreation such as organized sports natural areas are preserved for passive recreation such as walking and picnicking cin neighborhoods open space includes yards and shared areas for

fountain may be used as an open space in an office complex such open space shall include benches and shade trees 18gathering places apublic gathering spaces create the opportunity for informal interactions that help build a community they can vary widely in size in type and in degree of amenities gathering places include plazas squares and greens that are integral design components of development plans bpublic gathering spaces are required to be used as central organizing elements in activity centers and should be conveniently located within an easy fiveminute walking distance of any major building gathering places must occur in employment centers and office parks outside of activity centers the opportunity for outdoor dining in gathering places in commercial areas should be considered ccreate appealing and comfortable outdoor spaces and orient buildings to form such areas rather than isolating them in landscaped pods use trees walls topography and other site features to further define the space and lend a human scale to the area provide shade with trees or overhangs from the buildings duse open space as an organizing element of the site plan a gathering place can become a focal point for a development scheme eprovide amenities as needed including 1street furniture such as benches and picnic tables lighting and fountains  2bike racks  3outdoor cafs and seating areas  and 4electrical service and lighting for public events 19recreation and natural areas arecreation and natural areas are open spaces reserved for outdoor activities and for the enjoyment of nature overall community appearance should reflect the natural landscape in addition all residents should be able to enjoy open space within easy walking distance of their homes brecreation areas such as miniparks are generally anticipated to be small in size they provide space and equipment for outdoor activities within close walking distance of residences cnatural areas can preserve distinctive habitats or natural vegetation ranging from a particularly impressive mature tree to a greenbelt along a stream corridor dinclude private neighborhood recreation areas and childrens playgrounds within residential areas ewhenever feasible recreation and natural areas should be centrally located within a neighborhood provide sufficient open space within easy walking distance of all residents 1all residences should be within onequarter mile walk of a private recreation area or a town public park 2private miniparks should be a minimum of onequarter acre in size 3in multibuilding multifamily projects provide centrally located versatile recreation areas on site these can include level grassy areas play yards courtyards and natural areas along with amenities such as swimming pools tennis courts and other similar features 4link recreation and natural areas to townwide pedestrian systems and greenway systems as feasible 5provide pedestrian connections between open spaces of adjacent developments subdivisions and multifamily sites seek to connect to townwide network of open spaces and pedestrian system 20permitted accessory uses listed below shall be followed unless noted otherwise in this chapter asigns as regulated by   bresidential accessory uses or structures regulated by  126802  and cfences as regulated by passed 1222013  passed 762020  128307 building design guidelines azone a district tcspd1a 1design intent the design intent for this spd emphasizes denser development at the core of activity centers with density decreasing as it reaches the outlying residential area this concept for these cores as well as office development areas suggest buildings that will be placed closer together and closer to street fronts in many areas in order to maintain the current feel of this spd created by mostly one and twostory buildings certain techniques in building design will be required so that new development will not be in jarring contrast to the existing built environment every effort must be made to break down the appearance of facades that face a public street or parking area an anchor tenant store should ideally be designed to appear as a grouping of smaller stores with the focus on anchor tenants main entrance multiple entrances into a single anchor tenant store are encouraged particularly when a semiindependent use is part of that facility eg a video store or pharmacy as part of a supermarket or a garden center as part of a home improvement store all other building facades shall be designed to be compatible to each other in architectural style 2entrance orientation aentrance orientation refers to the direction of prominent entrances and front facades of a building generally the entrance facade will be the most prominent elevation of a building ba building may have more than one orientation the prominent front facade or elevation can face a major collector or corridor while elevations facing local streets parking or adjoining developments can have secondary facades and entrances design the needed entrances with a hierarchy to properly address the view of the building from various orientations 3building mass ause techniques to reduce the perceived mass of large buildings when making transitions to lower density areas modulate the mass of the building to relate to smaller buildings heights can be greater if the mass is modulated and other scale techniques are adopted reduce height near low density uses buse building mass appropriate to the site place buildings of the greatest footprint massing and height in activity center core areas or at the heart of office developments where the impact on adjacent uses is the least cfloortofloor heights of a building can have an impact on the mass of a building when articulating large buildings keep these floorto floor dimensions to a minimum dalso utilize methods described in a1 above etechniques of highlighting foundations lintels sills and cornices with contrasting materials and breaking up the mass of the building with bands at floor levels or projections at entries should be incorporated 4building configuration and materials adesign elements that impact the exterior appearance of a building must be incorporated into the architectural design such as 1facade articulation  2architectural details  3materials and textures  and 4color bdevelop a design theme that provides a distinctive character to a specific area within the special planning district 1establish design themes at the core of activity centers that have a palette of materials forms and features  create a coordinated but inviting mix of buildings and spaces  and establish a unique identity for each activity center  and 2establish design themes for residential neighborhoods such as colonial revival styled houses or neovictorian styled houses cbuilding walls 1elevations should be designed by the developer according to the general architectural character as listed in division a1 above 2walls facing a public street or public parking area should be designed in small sections to break up the appearance of a long horizontal wall 3building elements such as canopies porches bays or projections should be used to break up the appearance of a long wall 4buildings shall be clad in enduring materials of brick or stone splitface block is permitted if it is screened by another building or on rear elevations additionally splitface block may be used on front or side elevations if it is used as a base course or accent material concrete products made to simulate brick are also conditionally permitted precast concrete panels should only be used on the rear or side facades of anchor tenant buildings 5stucco or eifs systems are only permitted four feet above finished floor level if stucco is used as a primary material it should incorporate changes in depth plane and other architectural features to add detail and interest to a facade and to avoid the appearance of a monolithic wall 6accent materials such as tile metal or other appropriate traditional regional materials are encouraged metal shall not be used as a primary material on a facade 7all walls facing a public street or parking area shall be animated by change in color material fenestration or change in the depth of material 8brick stone or block shall be laid in a true bonding pattern no stack bond 9the maximum area of a front facade or a facade that faces a public street that is blank meaning of one contiguous material and color without fenestration accents or change in material or color is 625 square feet the maximum area of blank wall on a side facade that cannot be seen from a public street but faces a public parking area is 2400 square feet 10where blank facades face a public street or parking area are necessary trees spaced less than 20 feet on center should be used in front of these facades to gain visual interest and human scale 11front facades and side facades that face a public street shall be animated with changes in material andor color additionally all facades shall be designed to have a base middle and top dwindows and doors 1windows shall be of square or vertical proportion roundtop are permitted per approval 2the primary glass used on front facades and particularly around entrances shall be clear glass glass should be used to break up the boxlike interiororiented character of anchor tenant buildings and to connect the interior of the store to the outside spandrel glass or display window glass may be used to supplement clear glass areas and to animate a facade where display windows occur they shall be lit from within the store ebuilding roofs parapets and cornices 1if a change in parapet height exceeds two feet the parapet shall return 90 degrees on both sides by a minimum of one foot four inches 2elevations or portions of elevations that are visible from a public street or parking area shall incorporate a cornice to top the building cornices may be projected brick stone or precast courses or molded fiberglass they should be scaled appropriately to the building mass and be a minimum of one foot in height 3all rooftop equipment in excess of two feet high shall be screened from the street level fbuilding heightarea maximum building height is 35 feet above ground level finish floor this includes entrance parapets architectural elements and other accent features total building areas shall not exceed 100000 gross square feet combined floors gbuilding entrances and exits all entrances and exits intended for uses by the public shall incorporate glass areas using clear glass exclusive of the doors facing a public street or public parking area hadditions and expansions any additions or expansions to an existing store must be architecturally consistent to the existing structure in the use of color materials fenestration scale and other architectural features as approved by the planning commission 5setback schedule refer to codified  1271  1276  1277  1278 and 1280 for setback requirements for similar facilities and use groups 6outdoor displays aitems for outdoor display shall be undercover with some screening they may

feet six inches 8outdoor sales outdoor sidewalk sales with outside cash register are limited to 72 hours duration and no more than two such sales are permitted per month this does not prohibit outdoor displays as referenced in division a6 above 9color color is an integral element of the overall design and this special planning district must include the following 1a coordinated palette of colors created for each development this palette must be compatible with adjacent developments  2set the color theme by choosing the color for the material with the most area if there is more roof than wall area in a development roof color will be the most important color choice and will set the tone for the rest of the colors  3limit the number of color choices generally there is a wall color trim color accent color and roof color  4use natural tints of materials such as reds browns tans grays and greens as primary colors save bright accent colors for awnings and signs on commercial buildings  and 5use color variation to break up the mass of a building and provide visual interest bzone b district tcspd1b 1design intent this district of assembly business mercantile community mixed use institutional combined with different densities of residential and lifestyle community housing is to be designed with strong consideration given to controlled pedestrian and vehicular circulation homes are to be oriented to have natural views and connection to land that must be preserved as an open public green space for recreation site designers and developers are to use ingenuity and imagination in keeping with the overall land use and open space objectives of the district this spd allows more creative and flexible design of the built environment than possible with existing zoning and allows creative use of the clustering and density averaging concepts to concentrate homes on the site in order to maximize common open space every effort should be made to connect pedestrian trails with other public amenities for public access residential neighborhoods should incorporate pavilions and indoor recreation facilities the design should include curvilinear streets and irregular shaped blocks cluster type homes should be designed with front porch neighborhood style with garages being in the rear serviced by alleys for parking and service vehicles 2building setbacks refer to

lifestyle community housing is proposed to accommodate in one unified development creatively planned types of facilities that functionally meet the housing needs of our increasingly aging population bwith our life expectancies continually rising and the upcoming retirement of the healthy baby boomers generation housing needs have changed over the last several decades thus requiring municipalities to be proactive in zoning regulations to accommodate population and provide choices 2definition lifestyle community housing is defined as a selfcontained development to accommodate two basic types of residents atype 1 apartments individuals who regardless of age choose to live in a community of rental units comprising a structure of multiple levels with shared hallways and enclosed means of egress

conformance with the provisions of this chapter passed 171991  128602 findings and general standards athe prevention of accelerated flooding and stream channel erosion in conjunction with urban development requires control of the discharge rate and volume of runoff prior to its release to offsite land the purpose of this chapter is to permit development without increasing the flooding of other lands and provide a basis for design of storm drainage systems on lands above or below undeveloped areas which will preserve the rights and options of both contributing and receiving property owners and assure the longterm adequacy of storm drainage systems baccelerated channel erosion as well as increased flooding damage could be controlled if the predevelopment hydrograph could be maintained it is usually not practical however to retain the predevelopment rate of infiltration when a large part of the watershed is covered with impervious surfaces the concept of reducing peak flows below those of predevelopment storms was developed as an alternative to maintaining the predevelopment hydrograph the logic of this concept is to compensate for the increased erosiveness of 1increased volume of runoff due to loss infiltration  2more frequent occurrences of the same flow for example a subdivision may have the peak flow of a predevelopment fiveyear storm occur once a year after development is complete  and 3less sediment in the runoff water because the watershed is paved with nonerosive surfaces or good grass cover cthe twostep standard requires that 1the peak rates of runoff from an area after development shall be no greater than the peak rates of runoff from the same area before development for all 24hour storms from one to 100year frequency designing for the one two five ten 25 50 and 100year storms is considered adequate to meet the requirement storm water requirements must be met at each point storm water is discharged from a development area  2if the volume of runoff from an area after development will be greater than the volume of runoff from the same area before development it shall be compensated by reducing the peak rate of runoff from the critical storm and all more frequent storms occurring on the development area to the peak rate of runoff from a oneyear frequency 24hour storm occurring on the same area under predevelopment conditions storms of less frequent occurrence longer return periods than the critical storm up to the 100year storm shall have peak runoff rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size storms under predevelopment conditions dthe critical storm for a specific development area is determined as follows 1determine the total volume of runoff from a oneyear frequency 24 hour storm occurring on the development area before and after development  2from the volumes determined in division d1 hereof determine the percent of increase in volume of runoff due to development and using this percentage select the 24hour critical storm from this table  if the percentage of increase in the 24 hour critical storm for discharge limitation will be volume runoff is equal to or and less greater than than 0 10 1 year 10 20 2 year 20 50 5 year 50 100 10 year 100 250 25 year 250 500 50 year 500  100 year  ethe standard set forth in division d hereof basically requires peak flow to be reduced in proportion to increased runoff volume if runoff volume is not increased peak flows are only required to match predevelopment peak runoff rates for equivalent size storms for all storms from oneyear to 100 year storms this criterion is designed to require more control when the change in the runoff pattern caused by development is more drastic the quantity and cost of preventative control features will need to be in proportion to the level of increase in runoff caused by the change in land use  a fair and equitable criterion fconcern is frequently expressed in regard to the extremes of the accelerated storm water control standard  the one and the 100year frequency storms justification for using the oneyear storm is based on the erosivity of stream flow and on what is known as the routing problem small or frequent storms are very erosive because they occur so often damage doesnt have time to heal before the next storm comes bankfull channel flow is essentially the most erodible state of stream flow on the channel itself any increase spills out over the floodplain with very little increase in the velocity of channel flow any flow less than bankfull generally has a corresponding decrease in velocity and therefore causes less erosion damage to the channel where there is a significant increase in runoff volume it is very important to have the runoff occur at something less than bankfull flow especially in watersheds approaching complete development longer duration of bankfull flow than that which occurred under predevelopment conditions can have disastrous effects on the stream channel and resulting sediment pollution since channels generally size themselves for about a one and one half to a twoyear frequency storm runoff event the oneyear storm was chosen as the control storm to prevent significant channel erosion gthe routing problem is the problem of channel flow downstream from numerous smaller watersheds as runoff from the smaller watersheds is altered the effect on channel flow somewhere downstream where all of the watersheds come together can be favorable or adverse ideally the entire large watershed should be hydraulically planned and the level of control of each sub watershed should be based on the accumulative effects downstream since experience has proven the near impossibility politically of realizing that degree of organizational control the oneyear outlet rate is further justified in order to minimize adverse effects on the routing problem when compensation is necessary to control increased flow volumes hmany people suppose that runoff peaks and volumes do not increase from the large or infrequent storm because the ground is saturated by these storms and most of the rainfall will run off whether the land is used for forest land cropland or urban purposes urbanization can in fact cause an increase in both peak and volume of runoff most of the increase may be in the early part of such a storm and perhaps the 25 or 50year storm control may adequately address the situation there are many variables which affect the storm water runoff pattern including soil type slope kind of cover percent of impervious cover kind of disturbance and compaction the 100year storm needs to be examined in a development situation to determine its specific effect emergency flow areas and emergency outlets from structural work need to account for such storms if basements are not to be full of water and structures are not to fail the additional control necessary for the 100year frequency storm is not a highly significant factor in storm water management for accelerated runoff control iin addition to controlling channel erosion this standard should make long range planning for storm water management easier storm sewers and stream channels can be designed in accordance with existing runoff conditions knowing that upstream runoff rates cannot be increased this standard would also prevent an increase in flood levels and frequencies below future developments and in many cases reduce development costs because of reduced storm sewer size particularly where multiple use detention facilities can be utilized in designated open space ja uniform procedure for determining runoff would be helpful in designing to meet this standard the us soil conservation service procedures in technical release no 55 1986 edition are recommended these procedures consider watershed area watershed shape change in land use soil type hydrologic condition impervious area modification of hydraulic channels increased intensity of rainfall near the middle of a storm initial abstraction surface storage interception and infiltration prior to runoff and decreased infiltration as a storm progresses passed 171991

that the system of wetlands riparian areas rivers streams and other natural watercourses within the city contributes to the health safety and general welfare of the residents the specific purpose and intent of this part of these regulations is to regulate uses and developments within riparian and wetland setbacks that would impair the ability of riparian and wetland areas to 1reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows slowing the velocity of floodwaters and regulating base flow  2assist in stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce bank erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourse banks  3reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by filtering settling and transforming pollutants already present in watercourses  4reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering settling transforming and absorbing pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses  5provide watercourse habitats with shade and food  6provide habitat to a wide array of aquatic organisms wildlife many of which are on ohios endangered andor threatened species listings by maintaining diverse and connected riparian and wetland vegetation  or 7benefit the city economically by minimizing encroachment on wetlands and watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering solutions such as dams retention basins and rip rap to protect structures and reduce

in charge of all construction operations regardless of who performs the work 1the contractor must notify the doe of the project starting date and keep the doe informed of the proposed schedule of operations this allows the doe to anticipate engineering and inspection needs and therefore efficiently manage staff 2the contractor shall provide a list of material suppliers and subcontractors the doe will review the proposed lists of material suppliers and subcontractors  obtain required samples along with supporting documentationcertifications and work experience and references of subcontractors the lists should be submitted early to avoid delays associated with sampling and testing and checking of experience and references of subcontractors unless otherwise approved as part of

10172005  134602 constructability review aavoiding claims and reducing bidder risk and uncertainty can be accomplished by removing or lessening the factors that contribute to claims and higher than estimated bids a constructability review is one way to help avoid claims and provide for competitive bids within the engineers estimate usually the design project engineer dpe service director and the ce review the final design plans with the assistance of a knowledgeable third party when appropriate when conducting a constructability review the team should 1review general notes and special provisions  2review any subsurface investigations  3field review the project paying particular attention to arightofway encroachments or obstructions existing or impacted by the construction activity

 134603 prebid meeting during the bidding period a prebid meeting may be held including prospective bidders the ce dpe and service director at a minimum other agencies andor parties may be also requested to do so by the doe the purpose of this meeting is to encourage face to face discussion regarding plan intent and any areas of concern prior to bid opening this meeting is strongly recommended for complex large and high impact projects often this meeting will result in plan addendum that could have resulted in change orders andor claims after the project has been bid for those reasons the time and effort required for a prebid meeting is valuable to both contractors and the city passed 10172005  134604 preconstruction conference aa preconstruction conference precon shall be

the future for timely resolution of problems which surface during the project construction dthe contractor shall provide a progress schedule list of material sources list of subcontractors and a list of haul roads and designated local detours the contractor needs to request permission from the doe for both the use of local roadways to be used for hauling materials and equipment to and from the project and designated local detours passed 10172005  134605 monitoring progress aprogress meetings 1regularly scheduled progress meetings are a very productive tool for monitoring the status of a project they enhance communications and help solve problems before they turn larger and more costly attendance at progress meetings is required for the contractors superintendent doe staff and others as the point in progress dictates including representatives of subcontractors suppliers utilities and the like the main tool for monitoring a project is the progress schedule the schedule must be updated periodically to ensure an accurate measure of the progress of the work and to maintain the status of the project with respect to time the progress schedule may be used in any assessment of liquidated damages or incentivesdisincentives and a consideration with respect to any termination action the progress schedule shall be reviewed with the doe staff and the contractor at different intervals of the project as follows aat the start of the project to detect if the contractor began as scheduled  bevery two weeks or monthly depending on the complexity of the project  cfollowing the completion of a major item of work  dfollowing the completion of a phase or subphase of work  and ebefore during and after any type of delay to determine whether or not the delay was owner caused contractor caused or both 2the situations and decisions that pertain to the project should be recorded in a diary it is very important to keep a daily diary of activities of the project the diary entry should list the reasons the contractor cannot proceed with certain portions of the work accuracy and details in the daily diary concerning delays will protect the city against potential contractor claims bbehind schedule when the project progression is 15 days behind the original progress schedule the ce on behalf of the doe should send the contractor a letter requesting a revised progress schedule and reason for the delay once the contractor gives the ce a revised progress schedule including the reason for the delays the ce should review the revised progress schedule and check the daily diary to see if the reason for the projects delay agrees with the contractors explanation if delays are due to inexpediency or incompetence of the contractor or subcontractor the ce can request the removal of the individuals or subcontractors involved when a delay in the project has occurred the contractor must request a time extension in writing ctime extension and waiver of liquidated damages 1the ce shall have adequate written procedures for the determination of contract time as described in ref fapg c contract time extensions submitted by the contractor shall be subject to the concurrence of the ce contract time extensions submitted for approval to the ce must be fully justified and adequately documented by the contractor ref fapg  c the ce shall notify the service committee of the need for a contract time extension which may require a change in the agreement the service committee will review the proposed request for a contract time extension with the ce or designee and determine if a change in the agreement is necessary the ce or designee will coordinate with the service committee so that any agreement change is completed promptly 2if a contractor fails to complete the work by the contract completion date the contractor shall submit to the doe a written request to continue the contract work in the written request there shall be a plan for completion of the work the contractor must include a detailed explanation that will justify the granting of the extra time certain plan notes may require interim dates for phase completion and include special liquidated damages the service committee may grant a time extension or waiver of liquidated damages for excusable delays 3if the contractor causes the delay the service committee may consider liquidated damages or disincentives liquidated damages shall be applied in accordance with the requirements of the contract dprogress schedule 1the progress schedule must show the contractors plan to carry out the different work types including the procurement of materials and equipment ordering of special manufactured articles working drawings required permits and the planned dates of critical project milestones the ce must review the progress schedule to see if the schedule is acceptable the following items are to be used in determining an acceptable schedule aall major items of work are included  bthe contractors plan for the execution of the work is shown  cadherence to contract requirements is demonstrated  dcritical or controlling work activities and material deliveries are identified  estart and finish dates for the specific activities of work required by the contract are furnished  fspecial provisions in the contract including milestone dates andor interim completion

relationships between activities is shown  mgraphically depicts sequence of work  nappropriate consideration for progress during winter months  and othe arrangement of project phases per the plan if required 2the progress schedule is the responsibility of the contractor however the ce should review and accept the progress schedule if the schedule is not logical or is unreasonable the ce should ask for clarification the progress schedule is the main tool with which the doe shall monitor the progress of the contract it is therefore very important that the ce accurately review the schedule before accepting it monitoring the progress schedule can determine the responsible party for project delays passed 10172005  134606 project documentation arecord keeping is an integral part of contract administration and is especially important when considering any contract changes including but not limited to change orders and claimsdispute resolution adequate records must be maintained to document the need for changes and to establish pricing for extra work the primary goal of project records is to ensure that documentation exists for the acceptance of materials and work items for both quality and quantity the basis of acceptance for quality the method of measurement and the basis of payment are established by the specifications the records shall indicate that work was accomplished

encumbrances but under the project capped amount funding may be permitted funding of change orders not approved or for which no remaining fhwa andor state funds remain is the sole responsibility of the city fthe processing of change orders usually begins with the recognition of a need for a change order at the project level there is usually communication between the contractor and the doe if all parties agree that a change order should be generated a decision is made as to the type of change order that is needed gnote that the performance of extra work or additional quantities of work may warrant an extension of contract time extensions of contract time may involve additional direct project overhead cost honce the need to perform extra work on a project has been identified a basis of payment for this work must be established the two types of pricing for extra work are usually agreed unit price or force account price iagreed unit price is used when the extra work can be broken down into measurable units the number of units necessary to perform the work is estimated and a unit price determined and agreed upon the agreed upon unit price should be a unit price already established in the contract or comparative pricing may be used the doe may reference odots website of average bid prices to assist with this effort jforce account price is used when the work cannot be broken into measurable units or when a unit price cannot be agreed upon this method reimburses the contractor the actual costs of labor equipment and materials incurred in the performance of the work including allowable overhead and markup this method requires a significant amount of record keeping kthe records required for force account pricing of extra work must accurately depict all labor equipment and materials used by the contractor to perform the work the blue book for heavy highway equipment costs with the odot procedure for establishing appropriate equipment costs shall be utilized as per the 2002 odot c&ms  10905 the items that are necessary to record are shown below 1description of work  2contractors work force  3employee name  4classification  5hours worked  regular and overtime

the quantities of work in the units prescribed by the plan actually performed by the contractor change orders must be prepared to make adjustments for any differences between contract quantities and the quantities actually performed 2issues of efficiency or other similar factors may arise that may impact unit costs when the quantities actually performed differ significantly from those shown in the plan for these occurrences the quantity records shall be thorough enough to determine actual production rates and other such items passed 10172005  134612 claims aterms of agreement the city is subject to claims by the contractor who performs the work the terms of the project between the city and the contractor exist in the contract the specifications and the plans there are certain terms that are not stated in the contract documents these are known as implied terms for instance there is an implied warranty that the plans and specifications are free from defects and unless stated otherwise that there will be safe and continuous access to all areas within the projects boundaries claims arise from both stated and implied terms bclaims management process the citys claims management process must meet the general framework and intent of odots proposal note 25 dispute resolution and claims process this proposal note has formalized a claims management process at odot that requires progressive administrative reviews of a contractors claim prior to a filing in the court of claims by requiring administrative reviews beginning at the project level construction contract claims have been reduced likewise a process for the fair hearing of a claim or dispute reduces a contractors risk and ultimately results in more competitive bids cformalized claims process it is required that the city formalize a claims management process that includes progressive administrative reviews prior to formal legal action by the contractor the citys claims management process must be prepared and approved by city council prior to the contract award preferably the claims management process would be included in the citys bid documents duse of process required resolution of all claims must be according to the projects approved claims management process and approved the service committee or ce if the resolution affects the contract completion date andor increases project costs ewho can make a claim the only entity that may assert a claim against the city is the legal contractor of record if the project is being performed by a joint venture then only the joint venture may assert a claim a single party to the venture cannot assert a claim likewise a subcontractor may not assert a claim against the city but may make a claim against the prime contractor who in turn may assert a claim against the city for damages incurred by the subcontractor felements of a claim every claim has two distinct elements entitlement  and damages entitlement is the theory under which the contractor asserts the claim the contractor must prove entitlement examples are work not shown on plans conflict between plans and specifications third party delays and unforeseen conditions damages are the cost impacts incurred by the contractor which are over and above normal costs and which are caused by the claim event each claim must have both of these elements if a contractor encounters a situation where there would be an entitlement but incurs no monetary impact there is no claim likewise a contractor may state that he or she has incurred additional costs but cannot establish an entitlement then there is no claim gtypes of claims 1the contractor shall make a reasonable effort to mitigate damages mitigation might include resequencing reducing remobilizing or changing manpower the contractor is entitled to recover the costs of mitigation certain types of disputes by their nature may result in a claim claims may be due to plan discrepancies or omissions allowable costs in calculating change orders unforeseen site conditions quantity variations interferences and delays delays require careful analysis to determine who is responsible the contractor must demonstrate that the delay was critical it should be demonstrated that the delay in question affected the overall project schedule and was a controlling operation with respect to project completion 2delays that are unforeseeable and beyond the control of the contractor are excusable delays excusable delays may be either compensable or noncompensable delays caused by the city such as lack of site access late approval of shop drawing and redesign may be compensable delays caused by third parties outside the contractors control such as areawide labor disputes floods transportation industry delays fire and vandalism may be noncompensable nonexcusable delays are always noncompensable these delays such as subcontractor delay late mobilization production longer than scheduled and equipment breakdowns are caused by the contractor or under his or her control 3very often delays may occur from various sources at the same time these delays are known as concurrent delays the citycaused compensable delay occurring at the same time as an excusable delay that is noncompensable should result in a time extension but no recovery of costs the citycaused delay occurring at the same time as a contractor delay should result in a time extension but no recovery of costs both cases relieve the contractor from liquidated damages for the time in question 4the contractor is entitled to plan and pursue the work in order to finish ahead of the contract completion date if the city delays the contractor the contractor may be entitled to impact costs hproof of claim proof of entitlement and proof that additional costs were incurred rests solely with the contractor the contractor should put the city doe on notice of each instance where the contractor intends to file a claim  10402 of the ohio department of transportation c&ms this notice requirement allows the doe the opportunity to mitigate the claim situation and to begin to keep careful and specific records of the contractors activities manpower equipment and materials that are related to the claim ianalyzing a claim 1to analyze a claim the following steps should be taken adetermine the element of entitlement bwas the claim filed timely and was the doe given the required notice cidentify the contractors position dwhat does the contract plans and specifications say about it ewhat do the contract documents say fdetermine the actual conditions giving rise to the claim gidentify each specific claim issue what is the position of both sides on each issue hidentify responsibility if delay related is it excusable vs nonexcusable compensable or is there an issue of concurrent delay iwas there actually an impact 2at this point of the analysis if there is no entitlement then there is no claim if there is entitlement then continue on adetermine the element of damages breview the contractors cost ccompare with the doe records danalyze the damages jclaim avoidance the avoidance of claims is best affected by proper contract management practices the city can help prevent claims by practicing the following activities 1constructability reviews  2prequalification of contractors  3proper scheduling  4prompt resolution of change orders  5prebid and precon meetings  and 6partnering passed 10172005  134613 termination athere are two types of termination termination for convenience  and termination by default termination for convenience means the city can terminate the contract at anytime this usually occurs when project plans have huge errors or the project is severely affected by other projects or emergencies outside the control of the city btermination by default means the city can terminate the contract for the following reasons 1contractor fails to commence his or her work within a reasonable time  2contractor does not perform with reasonable progress  3contractor abandons fails or refuses to complete work  4contractor improperly performs the work  or 5contractor goes out of business or files bankruptcy ctermination by default is not an immediate event this type of default requires a series of events to occur over a period of time all of which must be documented by the
