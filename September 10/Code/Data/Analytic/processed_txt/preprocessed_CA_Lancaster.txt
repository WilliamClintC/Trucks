has consistently been higher than in the state of california and county of los angeles as a whole according to the labor market information division of the employment development department the average annual unemployment rate in the city as of february 2011 was sixteen and sixtenths 166 percent 2 statistics indicate that the citys higher unemployment rate correlates to a higher number of families living in poverty and to a higher crime rate 3 due to the lack of local jobs a higher percentage of the workforce residing in the city must commute long distances to find work causing increased traffic on state highways increased pollution increased use of gas and other fuels and other serious environmental impacts 4 because of the shortage of local jobs many residents of the city must leave for work very early in the morning and return late in the evening often leaving children and teenagers alone and unsupervised during the hours between school and the parents return from work outside the area 5 absentee parents and unsupervised youth can result in increased problems for families communities and the city as a whole including but not limited to increased crime more frequent and serious injuries poor homework accomplishments failing grades and increased high school dropout rates 6 the antelope valley needs an expanding employment base and a local hiring preference in public works contracts will benefit the city as a whole 7 the city spends significant amounts on purchasing personal property and materials in contracting for services and in constructing improvements to real property or to existing facilities the funds used in making those purchases are derived in part from taxes fees and other revenues of local businesses in the city to the extent possible such funds should be placed back into the local economy 8 the construction industry is a potential path to middle income employment and is therefore a crucial opportunity to connect residents with economic opportunities 9 a local hiring preference in public works contracts will provide job opportunities to city and antelope valley residents expand the areas employment base lessen the drain on public assistance resources and reduce the impacts on the environment caused by the high unemployment and long commuting times to jobs outside the area b the purpose of this

historically been subject to abuse by certain unscrupulous practitioners using the practice to commit fraud and larceny upon clients b it is the purpose of this chapter to regulate the practice of fortunetelling in such a manner as to reduce the risk of fraud and larceny to clients while allowing fortunetellers to provide their services to clients with only minimal restrictions c the provisions of this chapter requiring a license posting of fees providing receipts and allowing client recordation of the consultation will make it more difficult for an unscrupulous fortuneteller to commit fraud or larceny and yet as informational regulations will not affect the nature of the information conveyed by the fortuneteller nor the manner in which it is conveyed these regulations require only minimal expense and effort on the part of the fortuneteller and will not therefore impose any undue burden on their practices d fortunetelling for entertainment purposes as defined in this chapter does not create the same risk of fraud and larceny by an unscrupulous practitioner as would the practice with an individual client because it is done with a group at a public place for the purpose of entertaining and not to deal with the private concerns of an individual e for these and other reasons the provisions of this chapter are necessary to protect the health safety and welfare of the community 1   license required no person shall conduct engage in carry on participate in or practice fortunetelling or cause the same to be done for pay without having first obtained a license

part 2007 tobacco retailer regulations   title this chapter shall be known as the city of lancasters tobacco retailer regulations  part 2006   findings and purpose the city council finds and declares as follows more than 440000 people die in the united states from tobaccorelated diseases every year making it the nations leading cause of preventable death  and the world health organization who estimates that by 203 tobacco will account for 10 million deaths per year making it the greatest cause of death worldwide  and the california legislature has recognized the danger of tobacco use and has made reducing youth access to tobacco products a high priority as evidenced by the fact that  the legislature has declared that smoking is the single most important source of preventable disease and premature death in california cal health & safety   and  state law prohibits the sale or furnishing of cigarettes tobacco products and smoking paraphernalia to minors as well as the purchase receipt or possession of tobacco products by minors cal pen   and  state law requires that tobacco retailers check the identification of tobacco purchasers who reasonably appear to be under eighteen 18 years of age cal bus & prof  and provides procedures for using persons under 18 years of age to conduct onsite compliance checks of tobacco retailers cal bus & prof   and  state law prohibits the sale of tobacco products and paraphernalia services displays except in adultonly establishments cal bus & prof   and  state law prohibits the sale of bidis handrolled filterless cigarettes imported primarily from india and southeast asian countries except in adultonly establishments cal pen 1  and  state law prohibits the manufacture distribution or sale of cigarettes in packages of less than twenty 20 and prohibits the manufacture distribution or sale of rollyourown tobacco in packages containing less than 060 ounces of tobacco cal pen 3  and state law requires all tobacco retailers to be licensed by the board of equalization in order to curb the illegal sale and distribution of cigarettes which deprive the state yearly of hundreds of millions of tax dollars that fund local and state programs such as health services antismoking campaigns cancer research and education programs cal bus & prof 1 22972  and state law explicitly permits cities and counties to enact local tobacco retail licensing ordinances and allows for the suspension or revocation of a local license for a violation of any state tobacco control law cal bus & prof 3  and california courts in such cases as cohen v board of supervisors 40 cal 3d 277 1985 and bravo vending v city of rancho mirage 16 cal app 4th 383 1993 have affirmed the power of the city of lancaster to regulate business activity in order to discourage violations of law  and despite the states efforts to limit youth access to tobacco minors are still able to access cigarettes as evidenced by the fact that  nearly half of all youth smokers nationwide buy the cigarettes they smoke either directly from retailers or vending machines or by giving money to others to purchase the cigarettes for them  and  minors consume nine hundred twentyfour million 924000000 packs of cigarettes each year nationwide yielding the tobacco industry $480 million in profits from underage smokers  and  most adults who have ever tried smoking have tried their first cigarette under the age of eighteen 18 and are on average under the age of sixteen 16  research demonstrates that local tobacco retail ordinances dramatically reduce youth access to cigarettes as evidenced by the following  a study of several states found that youth sales of tobacco moved from a baseline of 70% of retailers selling to minors before the adoption of the ordinance to less than 5% in the year and a half after enactment  and  a study of the effect of licensing and enforcement methods used in the philadelphia area revealed a decrease in sales to minors from 85% in 1994 to 43% in 1998  and  a study of several minnesota cities found that an increased licensing fee in conjunction with strict enforcement of youth access laws led to a decrease from 398% to 49% in the number of youth able to purchase tobacco  and the implementation of tobaccolicensing requirements is supported by most californians as evidenced by the following  73% of california adults think tobacco retailers should be licensed   65% of californias key opinion leaders surveyed support implementation of tobaccolicensing requirements  and  over 90% of enforcement agencies surveyed in 2000 rated license suspension or revocation after repeated violations as an effective strategy to reduce youth access to tobacco  fortytwo 42 cities and counties in california have passed tobacco retailer licensing ordinances in an effort to stop minors from smoking and six hundred fifteen 615 communities in the united states require a license to sell tobacco products and provide penalties such as suspension or revocation of the license for illegal conduct eg selling tobacco to minors  and california retailers continue to sell tobacco to underage consumers evidenced by the following  14% of all tobacco retailers unlawfully sold to minors in 2004   315 % of nontraditional tobacco retailers such as deli meat and produce markets sold to minors in 2004   teens surveyed in 2002 say they bought their cigarettes at gas stations 58% liquor stores 45% and supermarkets and small grocery stores 25%  a requirement for a tobacco retailer license will not unduly burden legitimate business activities of retailers who sell or distribute cigarettes or other tobacco products to adults it will however allow the city of lancaster to regulate the operation of lawful businesses to discourage violations of federal state and local tobaccorelated laws  and the city of lancaster has a substantial interest in promoting compliance with federal state and local laws intended to regulate tobacco sales and use  in discouraging the illegal purchase of tobacco products by minors  in promoting compliance with laws prohibiting sales of cigarettes and tobacco products to minors  and finally and most importantly in protecting children from being lured into illegal activity misconduct of adults  and it is the intent of the city council in enacting this ordinance to encourage responsible tobacco retailing and to discourage violations of tobaccorelated laws especially those which prohibit or discourage the sale or distribution of tobacco and nicotine products to minors but not to expand or reduce the degree to which the acts regulated by federal or state law are criminally proscribed or to alter the penalties provided therein  part 2006   definitions unless the particular provision

existing fses or fses that change ownership that undergo remodeling or a change in operations as defined in this chapter shall be required to install a grease interceptor  7142009   variance and waiver of grease interceptor requirement a variance from grease interceptor requirements an existing fse may obtain a variance from the grease interceptor requirement to allow alternate pretreatment technology that is at least equally effective in controlling the fog discharge in lieu of a grease interceptor if the fse demonstrates that it is impossible or impracticable to install operate or maintain a grease interceptor the fog control program managers determination to grant a variance will be based upon but not limited to evaluation of the following conditions 1 there is no adequate space for installation andor maintenance of a grease interceptor 2 there is no adequate slope for gravity flow between kitchen plumbing fixtures and the grease interceptor andor between the grease interceptor and the private collection lines or the city sewer 3 the fse can justify that the alternative pretreatment technology is equivalent or better than a grease interceptor in controlling its fog discharge in addition the fse must be able to demonstrate after installation of the proposed alternative pretreatment its effectiveness to control fog discharge visual monitoring of the sewer system for at least three months with a minimum of two visual inspections  one at the beginning and one at the end of the threemonth period at its own expense a variance may be granted if the results as determined by the fog control program manager show no visible accumulation of fog in its lateral andor tributary downstream sewer lines b conditional waiver from installation of grease interceptor an existing fse may obtain a conditional waiver from installation of a grease interceptor if the fse demonstrates that it has negligible fog discharge and insignificant impact to the sewer system although a waiver from installation of grease interceptor may be granted the fse may be required to provide space and plumbing segregation for future installation of a grease interceptor the fog control program managers determination to grant or revoke a conditional waiver shall be based upon but not limited to evaluation of the following conditions 1 quantity of fog discharge as measured or as indicated by the size of the fse based on seating capacity number of meals served menu water usage amount of onsite consumption of prepared food and other conditions that may reasonably be shown to contribute to fog discharges 2 adequacy of implementation of best management practices and compliance history 3 sewer size grade condition based on visual information fog deposition in the sewer by

interceptor is not feasible and no equivalent alternative pretreatment can be installed a waiver from the grease interceptor requirement may be granted with the imposition of a fog control surcharge fee as described in additional requirements may be imposed to mitigate the discharge of fog into the sewer system the fog control program managers determination to grant the waiver with a fog control surcharge fee will be based upon but not limited to evaluation of the following conditions 1 there is no adequate space for installation andor maintenance of a grease interceptor 2 there is no adequate slope for gravity flow between kitchen plumbing fixtures and the grease interceptor andor between the grease interceptor and the private collection lines or the city sewer 3 a variance from grease interceptor installation to allow alternative pretreatment technology cannot be granted d application for waiver or variance of requirements for grease interceptor a fse may submit an application for variance or waiver from the grease interceptor requirement to the fog control program manager the fse bears the burden of demonstrating to the fog control program managers reasonable satisfaction that the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible or applicable upon determination by the fog control program manager that reasons are sufficient to justify a variance or waiver the permit will be issued or revised to include the variance or waiver and relieve the fse from the requirement e terms and conditions a variance or waiver shall contain terms and conditions that serve as the basis for its issuance a variance or waiver may be revoked at any time as set forth in of this chapter when any of the terms and conditions for its issuance is not satisfied or if the conditions upon which the waiver was based change so that the justification for the waiver no longer exists the variance or waiver shall be valid so long as the fse remains in compliance with their terms and conditions until the expiration date specified in the variance or waiver such expiration date shall be no longer than two years from the date of issuance of the variance or waiver  7142009   commercial properties property owners of commercial properties or their official designees shall be responsible for the installation and maintenance of the grease interceptor serving

that operate without a grease control interceptor may be required to pay an annual fog control surcharge fee in addition to the annual fog control program charge to equitably cover the costs of increased maintenance of the sewer system as a result of the fses inability to adequately remove fog from its wastewater discharge this section shall not be interpreted to allow the new construction of or existing fses undergoing remodeling or change in operations to operate without an approved grease interceptor unless the city has determined that it is impossible or impracticable to install or operate a grease control interceptor for the subject facility under the provisions of this chapter a the amount of the annual fog control surcharge fee shall be established by resolution of the city council and shall be based on the estimated annual increased cost of maintaining the sewer system and for inspection and removal of fog and other viscous or solidifying agents attributable to the fse resulting from the lack of a grease interceptor or grease control device b the annual fog control surcharge fee may be waived or reduced to when the discharger demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the fog control program manager that they had used best management and waste minimization practices on a regular basis that has significantly reduced the introduction of fog into the sewer system the waiver or reduction of the fee shall be applicable for twelve 12 months from the date of waiver or reduction issuance c the fog control surcharge fee may not be waived or reduced when the fse does not comply with the minimum requirements of this chapter andor its discharge into the sewer system has caused or potentially caused or contributed alone or collectively in any sewer

defined area a same language as current ordinance b defined area b defined area b is bounded sr14 12th street west avenue l and avenue m and consists of numerous vacant lots and developed properties which exhibit narrow lot depths resulting from rightofway acquisition at the time of freeway construction the provisions of the zoning ordinance require minimum 10 foot building set backs for both the rear and interior side yards for properties located in the li zone because of the narrow lot configurations these requirements often create practical difficulties in developing property within defined

directors determination the director of community development may reduce or eliminate the yard requirements upon making the findings as noted below the requirement for front and street side yards shall not be reduced to less than 10 feet of landscaped width except where such requirement would unreasonably interfere with the expansion of an existing building that does not have a setback of at least 10 feet or where the requirement would preclude the provision of required parking the director may grant exceptions where he determines that the following circumstances exist a compliance with the normal yard requirements will result in practical difficulties and unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the purpose of the yard requirements because of the size or configuration of the parcels or the location of existing onsite buildings  and b it is not practical for the project proponent to acquire additional property that would allow the yard requirements to be met  and c granting of the

periodic inundation which could result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately flood proofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  7 to insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 to insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purpose this article includes methods and provisions for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  2 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  4 controlling fill grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in

7055   variance procedures a nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature though these standards vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in general a properly issued variance is granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this article would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the planning commission to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare therefore the variance guidelines provided in this article are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate 1 in passing upon such applications the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this article and a the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  f the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and k the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water system and streets and bridges 2 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be give written notice over the signature of a community official that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage  and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain board in the office of the los angeles county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 3 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration of the federal emergency management agency b conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of 12 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond 12 acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary as defined in  considering the flood hazard to afford relief 5 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in  to the applicant  and c a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances as defined in  cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections b15 of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety 7 upon consideration of the factors of subsection a3 of this section and the purposes of this article the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article 8 a fee may be charged for the variance process as provided for in resolution no 91174 c the city clerk shall certify to the passage of the ordinance codified in this article and shall cause it to be posted or
