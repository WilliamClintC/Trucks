products or acceptable brands list these lists are developed only where it is not possible to write specifications adequate to identify the quality and performance required of the goods or services to be purchased acceptable brands lists are also used when tests that would be necessary to determine compliance with technical specifications are lengthy costly or require complicated technical equipment b specifications by brand or trade name brand or trade names should be used where brand name products have been found to be superior to others for the purpose intended c specifications by blueprint or dimension sheet specifications of construction projects for everything from buildings and streets to custombuilt cabinets furniture machines or other equipment should be written to reference the blueprints or dimension sheets prepared by the engineer or architect d specifications by chemical analysis or physical properties specifications which include the chemical analysis or physical properties of the goods when clearly requested place responsibility on the supplier to provide exactly those items requested e specifications by performance purpose or use specifications which include a set of performance criteria for the goods or services required will provide flexibility for vendors to design products or programs specifically aimed at meeting such criteria f specification by identification with industry standards specifications will often refer to industrywide standards or to standards set by other public jurisdictions g specifications by samples whenever appropriate a sample is always a good way to make requirements perfectly clear 3 delivery and performance guidelines a contract or purchase order that is complete in all respects and that is accepted by the parties concerned still must produce the intended results or objectives before it can be considered a successful or completed purchase the terms and conditions must clearly define the delivery and performance requirements of the services supplies or equipment a followup and expediting followup normally applies to the monitoring of the delivery schedules to assure compliance expediting in the purest sense involves an attempt to improve or to reduce the contractually stipulated delivery time for various reasons and the vendor is not legally obligated to comply the primary objectives of the followup function are 1 to assure full compliance by the vendor  and city code 2 to develop documentation for future evaluation of the vendors performance  if delivery problems develop there are certain techniques that may be used to help solve them a contact the salesman for assistance  b initiate collect phone calls  letters may also be used  c visit the vendors plant this might help solve the problem and will assist in verifying any reason for the delay  d cancel the contract for nonperformance prior to the cancellation authorization from the director of finance or city administrator must be obtained 4 delinquent deliveries when followup efforts have failed and the deliveries have become delinquent one 1 of two 2 actions must be taken a authorize additional time for delivery  or b cancel and order from other sources prior to cancellation authorization from the director of finance or city administrator must be obtained in all cases the reasons for delinquent deliveries should be documented this information may be needed in evaluating future bids submitted by that particular vendor 5 partial deliveries some purchase orders may list several items if these items can be used separately partial payments can and should be authorized however if the separate items are part of a system then partial deliveries should not be authorized 6 substitution to meet the contractual delivery schedule it may be appropriate in some situations to consider substitute items the specifications may cover such a possibility whenever substitutions are necessary due to shortcomings of the vendor it is the responsibility of the purchaser to seek and obtain an adjustment for lower prices on the substituted items 7 nonperformance should the vendor fail to meet any requirements of the specifications the vendor can be cited for nonperformance recourse could include a the city may exercise its rights under a liquidateddamages clause or under the terms of a performance bond ordinance b the city may obtain the needed items from another source and charge delinquent vendor the excess difference in cost c the city may terminate the contract for default if it is in the best interest of the city and items can be obtained under more favorable conditions from other sources any such action should be approved by the finance director or the city administrator 8 inspection and testing guidelines goods and materials should be checked at the time of receipt to detect any damage or defects inspection and testing may be performed at origin or destination a reports rejection and return authorization whenever an inspection is performed all reports to properly support claims or actions must be thoroughly documented a copy of the inspection report will normally be used to substantiate payment for the goods and verification of receipt in the event of rejection for whatever purpose certain steps must be taken to inform and protect the rights of the vendor as well as the city reasons for rejection must be listed and these reasons should reference specific requirements of the contract b damage during shipment it is important that all damage be completely described on the receiving report any evidence of concealed damage should be noted at this time the carrier should be notified immediately and a joint inspection should be scheduled with the carriers representative when it is apparent that the extent of the damage causes the goods to be worthless they should not be accepted c latent defects latent defects may be the result of damages in transit or of failure of the

single site this combination of traditional zoning classifications under one 1 development is designed to permit greater flexibility and should benefit both the developer and the public interest it is not the intent of these regulations to circumvent traditional zoning classifications increase the average density or uses beyond that which is provided for in other the zoning allow development which is not compatible with the principles of the comprehensive plan these regulations should provide for a greater flexibility in the design of yards courts buildings and circulation than would otherwise be possible strict application of district regulations in order to provide the opportunity for 1 a pattern of development which preserves trees outstanding natural topography geologic features and prevents soil erosion 2 a creative approach to the use of land and related physical development 3 example usage of the method of urban planning called coving opposed to conventional or grid planning methods some of the advantages of a coved layout reduces construction costs by reducing roadway thereby lowering paving and utility line costs the reduction in road surface adds usable land for lots and parks other benefits are increased pedestrian safety due to less road and ordinance fewer intersections individual properties also gain aesthetic value from the separate meandering setback lines sidewalks and roadways 4 open space andor recreation areas 5 an efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets and thereby lower building costs 6 an environment of stable character in harmony with surrounding development 7 a more desirable environment than would be possible strict application of other this planning and zoning commission and subsequently the board of aldermen may exclude any uses within the development andor attach or include any restrictions or conditions consideration may be given but not be limited to the compatibility and relationship of uses
