appropriateness of a preliminary plat 2 purpose of preliminary plats the purpose of a preliminary plat review process is to allow an applicant to determine the appropriateness of a proposed conceptual subdivision design this shall generally mean the configuration of streets and lots  conceptual landscaping design  and conceptual engineering plans 3 submittal requirements the primary difference between a preliminary and final plat is the submittal requirements the submittal requirements for a preliminary plat shall be as established by the director of community development  but generally a preliminary plat may be accompanied by conceptual engineering site and landscape plans whereas a final plat must be accompanied by final plans 4 submittal of final plats after preliminary approval

the consolidation of lots of any size into a single lot of record which subdivision or consolidation does not involve any new streets extensions of existing streets or easements of access and complies with all provisions of this and all other applicable notwithstanding the foregoing in light of   of this an administrative plat may involve a lot in an r1 or r2 single family residence district which has been developed with a dwelling and does not meet the minimum lot size andor lot width requirements provided the lot size and lot width of the lot in question equals at least 80 percent of that required by   or   of this whichever is applicable and further provided that the lot and the location of the dwelling and accessory structures thereon if any otherwise complies with the provisions of chapters 154 and 155 of this 1 preapplication meeting although this first step is optional it is highly recommended that the subdivider schedule a meeting with the department of community development and other appropriate staff to discuss the feasibility of the proposal and review village requirements and procedures depending upon the plat and the type of development proposal the subdivider may meet with village staff on more than one occasion the subdivider may submit a conceptual or sketch plan asking to comment on it before a formal submission is made while requiring additional time and effort before the start of the process this ultimately works to the advantage of both the village and the subdivider by serving to identify the major flaws or deficiencies of the proposal at an early stage while the project design is still relatively flexible  and thus eliminates potential time delays as the proposal works its way review and approval process 2 submittal of application for plat approval submittal of the application for plat approval formally begins the villages development review process the application consists of the completion and submittal of the application form provided by the department of community development submittal of the final plat of subdivision payment of the required fees payment of any applicable engineering fees and any required supporting

calendar days of written notification of the committees findings or the plat approval will be null and void 4 final approval upon the conclusion of its review and receipt of the final plat the director of community development shall grant or deny the plat as determined appropriate approval shall be so designated by the directors signature on the final plat of subdivision if denied the director shall inform the subdivider in writing of the denial the reasons for the denial and procedures for appealing the directors decision 5 appeal of administrative plat denial any aggrieved party may request plan commission review of the plat by filing a letter of appeal with the department of community development and within 30 calendar days of the formal approval or denial of the plat of

file at the department of community development for purview by the public a copy of the approved and recorded final plat of subdivision will be returned to the subdivider d minor and major plats of subdivision a minor plat consists of a lot or block of less than one acre that does not meet the criteria of an administrative plat but which does not include any new streets extensions of existing

development of the community it is not intended that the board automatically grant the maximum use exceptions or density premiums of any proposed planned development the plan commission shall only recommend the granting of such premiums or latitudes which are consistent with sound land use planning village growth policy and benefits accruing to the village as a result of the planned development

accommodate development which is in the public interest and which would not otherwise be permitted pursuant to this planned development may be of residential commercial office or industrial use a planned development may also be of mixed use subject to the regulation of such planned developments as specified in this section b a planned development is of a substantially different character than other uses described in this is therefore considered a conditional use the regulations applicable to planned developments allow for far more flexibility than do the regulations for other uses c planned developments possess unique attributes and can be surrounded by a wide variety of existing and proposed land uses therefore planned developments shall be evaluated and decided upon by the plan commission and the village board on a casebycase basis d specifically planned developments are intended to provide for any or all of the following elements 1 a maximum choice in the types of development available to the public by allowing developments that would not be possible under the strict application of the terms of other sections of this 2 permanent preservation of common space and recreation areas and facilities  3 a pattern of development to preserve topographic and geographic features and natural vegetation  4 a creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities that results in better development design and the construction of aesthetic amenities  5 an efficient use of the land resulting in a more efficient provision of utilities streets schools public grounds and buildings and other facilities  6 innovations in residential commercial office and industrial development so that the growing demands of the population may be met by greater variety in type design and layout of buildings and by the conservation and more efficient use of open space ancillary to said buildings 7 a unified and compatible design of buildings structures and site improvements e as specified in this a planned development shall be considered a conditional use and may be granted in those districts in which it is listed as a conditional use provided the planned

for the planned development 2 common open space must be used as an aesthetic amenity or recreation purpose the uses authorized for the common open space must be appropriate to the scale and character of the planned development considering its size density expected population topography and the number and type of dwelling to be provided 3 common open space must be suitably improved for its intended

appropriate to the uses which are authorized for the common open space and must conserve and enhance the amenities topography and unimproved conditions of the common open space 4 the development

approval the village recognizes that individual units within larger planned developments frequently develop over a number of years and can encompass a variety of design features that are not typically addressed as part of an original planned development approval additionally as approved planned developments mature and individual tenants within a nonresidential planned development change parking and signage needs may also change the village recognizes the site plan approval process as a flexible method for review of individual components of the overall planned development this process provides
