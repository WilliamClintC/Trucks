the township council is in agreement with the new jersey state legislature in finding and declaring that children who are left unsupervised during overnight hours may be exposed to the most detrimental influences of our society  that the allure of the drug countered culture the potential for involvement in criminal activity and other potential threats to the health safety and general welfare of children justify governmental action in furtherance of the protection of one of the most fragile and easily influenced segments of our society the township council is also in agreement with the findings of the new jersey state legislature that it is in the best interest of society to encourage family unity  to encourage the family unit to provide for the care protection wholesome mental and physical development of our children  and to encourage the supervision of children by their parents andor legal guardians and to encourage communication between parents and their children the township council is in further agreement that because of the vulnerability of children their inability to make critical decisions in an informed and mature manner and the importance of the parental role in child rearing that it was appropriate for the new jersey state legislature to adopt njsa 252 which authorizes municipalities in this state to adopt ordinances to protect children from the dangers of the streets and to encourage the deepening of family relationship the township council further finds and declares that there has been a breakdown in the supervision normally provided by certain parents andor legal guardians for juveniles under his age of eighteen 18 years resulting in juveniles being involved in certain types of unacceptable behavior including certain criminal activities involving controlled dangerous substances their possession andor distribution as well as acts of vandalism noisy and rowdy behavior and harassment of residents the township council further finds and declares that these offensive activities committed by juveniles are not easily controlled by existing laws or ordinances because the activities can be concealed whenever police officers are present and that the establishment of a reasonable curfew in this community will result in maintaining a free and unobstructed access to the streets and public places while enabling the police to act reasonably and fairly to prevent the violation of laws and municipal ordinances by juveniles  366 general provisions  371  the township council further finds and declares that a curfew meets a very real local need and that curfew ordinances have been adopted in other municipalities in the bayshore as well as state of new jersey in order to address the problem of juvenile delinquency the township council further finds and declares that a curfew is particularly appropriate in view of the basic residential nature of this community and the sense of the community that there is a proper time for the cessation of outdoor activities by juveniles this sense of the community is reflected in the curfew hours declared in this section which takes into consideration the increased likelihood for criminal activities during the overnight hours and the detrimental affect that the exposure to such activities would have upon juveniles in our community the township council further finds and declares that as parental control increases there is a likelihood that juvenile delinquency will decrease  that there is a need for a curfew for juveniles in the township of aberdeen  and that the establishment of a curfew with penalties applicable not only to juveniles but to their parents and legal guardians as well will reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of parents andor legal guardians over juveniles in their care and custody  372 definitions 1973 2   as used in this section curfew hours  shall mean the following a  pm on any sunday monday tuesday wednesday or

and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed a the flood hazard areas of the township of aberdeen are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored causes damage in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss a to protect human life and health  b to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d to minimize prolonged business interruptions  e to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  g to ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h

to prepare and implement a stormwater management plan to establish the minimum stormwater management requirements and controls for major development b stormwater management plan the township of aberdeen implements the stormwater management plan in paragraph d of this subsection as required by njsa d93 and in conjunction with stormwater control of the revised general ordinances township of aberdeen c applicability 1 the stormwater management plan and shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for the following major developments that require preliminary or final site plan or subdivision review a nonresidential major developments  and b aspects of residential major developments that are not preempted by the residential site improvement standards per njac  2 this subsection shall also be applicable to all major developments undertaken by the township of aberdeen d stormwater management plan 1 introduction this municipal stormwater management plan mswmp documents the strategy for aberdeen township to address existing and prevent future stormwaterrelated impacts the creation of this plan is a required element as described in njac a25 municipal stormwater regulations this plan contains all of the required elements described in njac  stormwater management rules the plan addresses groundwater recharge stormwater quantity and stormwater quality impacts by incorporating stormwater design and performance standards for new major development defined as projects that disturb one or more acres of land or contain one quarter 14 acre of land or more of new impervious coverage these standards are intended to minimize the adverse impact of stormwater runoff on surface water quality and water quantity and the loss of groundwater recharge that provides baseflow in receiving water bodies the plan 28editors note figures #1 #10 referred to herein and adopted by can be found at the end of this chapter  25525 general provisions  25525  describes longterm operation and maintenance measures for existing and future stormwater facilities the plan addresses the review and update of existing ordinances the township master plan and other planning documents to allow for project designs that include low impact development techniques the final component of this plan is a mitigation strategy for when a variance or exemption of the design and performance standards is sought as part of the mitigation section of the stormwater plan specific stormwater management measures have been identified and may be further modified in the future to lessen the impact of existing and new developments 2 goals the goals of this mswmp are to reduce flood damage including damage to fife and property  minimize to the extent practical any increase in stormwater runoff from any new development  reduce soil erosion from any development or construction project  assure the adequacy of existing and proposed culverts and bridges and other instream structures to handle existing and projected future flows  maintain groundwater recharge  provide to the greatest extent feasible a decrease in nonpoint pollution  maintain the integrity of steam channels for their biological functions as well as for drainage  minimize pollutants in stormwater runoff from new and existing development  restore enhance and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the waters of the state  protect the public health  safeguard fish and aquatic life and scenic and ecological values  enhance recreational and other uses of water  protect the public safety proper design and operation of stormwater detentionretention systems encourage municipal action to guide the appropriate use or development of lands in the municipality in a manner which will promote the public health safety morals and general welfare secure safety from fire flood panic and other natural and manmade disasters   25525 aberdeen code  25525  promote the conservation of historic sites and districts open space energy resources and valuable natural resources in the municipality  prevent urban sprawl and degradation of the environment use of land  and promote utilization of renewable energy sources to achieve these goals this plan outlines specific stormwater design and performance standards for new development and where possible development application review process to mitigate impacts from existing development preventative and corrective maintenance strategies are included in the plan to ensure longterm effectiveness of stormwater management facilities the plan also outlines safety standards for stormwater infrastructure to be implemented to protect public safety 3 stormwater discussion land development can dramatically alter the hydrologic cycle see figure 1 of a site and ultimately an entire watershed prior to development native vegetation can either directly intercept precipitation or draw that portion that has infiltrated into the ground and return it to the atmosphere development can remove this beneficial vegetation and replace it with lawn or impervious cover reducing the sites evapotranspiration and infiltration rates clearing and grading a site can remove depressions that store rainfall construction activities may also compact the soil and diminish its infiltration ability resulting in increased volumes and rates of stormwater runoff from the site impervious areas that are connected to each other channels and storm sewers can transport runoff more quickly than natural areas this shortening of the transport or travel time quickens the rainfallrunoff response of the drainage area causing flow in downstream waterways to peak faster and higher than natural conditions these increases can create new and aggravate existing downstream flooding and erosion problems and increase the quantity of sediment in the channel filtration of runoff and removal of pollutants by surface and channel vegetation is eliminated by storm sewers that discharge runoff directly into a stream increases in impervious area can also decrease opportunities for infiltration to streams that depend on base flows in summer months and also decrease the potential for ground water recharge reduced base flows and increased peak flows produce greater fluctuations between normal and storm flow rates which can increase channel erosion reduced base flow can also negatively impact the hydrology of adjacent wetlands and the health of biological communities that depend on base flows finally erosion and sedimentation can destroy habitat and thus adversely impact some species that cannot readily adapt  25525 general provisions  25525  in addition to increases in runoff peaks and volumes and loss of ground water recharge land development often results in the accumulation of pollutants on the land surface that runoff can mobilize and transport to streams new impervious surfaces and cleared areas created by development can accumulate a variety of pollutants from the atmosphere fertilizers animal wastes and leakage and wear from vehicles pollutants can include metals suspended solids hydrocarbons pathogens and nutrients in addition to increased pollutant loading land development can adversely affect water quality in more subtle ways for example stormwater falling on impervious surfaces or stored in detention or retention basins can become heated and raise the temperature of the downstream waterway adversely affecting cold water fish species such as trout development can remove trees along stream banks that normally provide shading stabilization and leaf litter that falls into streams and becomes food for the aquatic community 4 aberdeen township background 41 general aberdeen township first established in 1677 and incorporated in 185 encompasses a 54 square mile area in the northeast corner of monmouth county new jersey see figure 2 for existing land uses the population of the township has remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations from 17235 in 198 to 17038 in 199 to 17454 in 2000 see figure 3 for existing zoning districts however in recent years the township has been under significant development pressure where several large development projects have either been approved and constructed or have received preliminary and final approval from the township planning board and have intent to be under construction by early 2007 these developments are estimated to increase the population by approximately 1600 individuals changes in the landscape will most likely increase stormwater runoff volumes and pollutant loads to the waterways of the municipality figure 4 illustrates the waterways in the township figure 5 depicts the township boundary on the usgs quadrangle maps figure 6 shows vacant lands a portion of which may be available for future development 42 waterways the township of aberdeen is traversed by multiple waterways generally flowing from the southsouthwest to northnortheast to raritan bay whale creek forms a portion of the township boundary with old bridge long neck creek and treasure lake discharge  25525 aberdeen code  25525  both flow into whale creek whale creek is tidal up to approximately route 35 matawan creek and birch swamp brook both flow into lake lefferts located in both aberdeen and matawan borough gravelly brook and its tributaries flow into lake matawan located in matawan borough both lakes discharge into matawan creek which is tidal below the dams and who flows into raritan bay mohingson brook and its tributaries flow strathmore section of the municipality and into matawan creek a portion of the mohingson is also tidal to approximately the new jersey transit railroad culvert luppatong creek flows northerly then easterly portion of the strathmore section of the township then crosses over into hazlet township and ultimately to raritan bay a substantial amount of the flows in the various brooks and creeks originate in communities beyond the borders of aberdeen township raritan bay is subject to restricted shellfish activities and is deemed as being moderately impaired the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep has established an ambient biomonitoring network amnet to document the health of the states waterways there are over 800 amnet sites throughout the state of new jersey these sites are sampled for benthic macroinvertebrates by njdep on a fiveyear cycle streams are classified as nonimpaired moderately impaired or severely impaired based on the amnet data the data is used to generate a new jersey impairment score njis which is based on a number of biometrics related to benthic macroinvertebrate community dynamics the one major water body that borders the township to the northeast the raritan bay is moderately impaired accordingly the various lakes brooks and creeks located within the township although are not individually listed in the amnet data as they are all tributary to the raritan bay by definition the tidal portions thereof must be considered as moderately impaired in addition to the amnet data the njdep and other regulatory agencies collect water quality chemical data on the streams in the state this data shows that total mercury bioxine pathogen and pcb concentrations of the raritan bay frequently exceed the states criteria this means that the bay is an impaired waterway and the njdep is required to develop a total maximum daily load tmdl of these pollutants for the bay see appendix  25525 general provisions  25525  further per the proposed 2004 integrated list gravelly brook is classified as severely impaired mohingson or wilksons brook whale creek and lake lefferts are also impaired a tdml is the amount of a pollutant that can be accepted by a waterbody without causing an exceedance of water quality standards or interfering with the ability to use a waterbody for one or more of its designated uses the allowable load is allocated along with a margin of safety to the various sources of the pollutant such as stormwater and wastewater discharges which require an njpdes permit to discharge and to nonpoint sources which includes stormwater runoff from agricultural areas and residential areas provisions may also be made for future sources in the form of reserve capacity an implementation plan is developed to identify how the various sources will be reduced to the designated allocations implementation strategies may include new or improved stormwater treatment facilities or plants adoption of ordinances reforestation of stream corridors retrofitting stormwater systems and other best management practices bmps the new jersey integrated water quality monitoring and assessment report 305band 303d integrated list is required by the federal clean water act to be prepared biennially every 5 years and is a valuable source of water quality information this combined report presents the extent to which new jersey waters are attaining water quality standards and identifies waters that are impaired the integrated list proposed 2004 constitutes the list of waters impaired or threatened by pollutants for which one or more tmdls are needed as previously indicated raritan bay and its various tidal tributaries mohingson brook whale creek and lake lefferts are moderately impaired and gravelly brook is listed as severely impaired 43 existing stormwater infrastructure due to the age and the location of the township a substantial portion of the community as well as its existing stormwater infrastructure was built with minimal regard for stormwater control or management few detention or recharge facilities were constructed serving single family or commercial properties some facilities were constructed to serve multifamily projects and are owned and maintained by various homeowner associations however said facilities would not meet todays standards the township previously located the majority of its stormwater outlet structures numbering approximately 300 headwalls or pipe terminuses in the early 1990s in addition the  25525 aberdeen code  25525  municipality mapped a significant portion of the stormwater facilities in 1995+ however said mapping was not in gis or arcview format accordingly in conformance with its tier a municipal stormwater permit requirements and its stormwater pollution prevention plan the township will remap all of its outfall facilities by 2009 the townships stormwater infrastructure has been well maintained should any difficulties arise the township endeavors to resolve them immediately the township has instituted a complaint hotline and response protocol that requires an investigation and response within 24 hours for example the townships public works received complaints from a resident who reported a driveway cavein on her property as a result preliminary excavation and television investigations determined the bottom of the pipe rotted out the soils within aberdeen township are very acidic clays creating a detrimental environment for pipes that have not been treated properly once the pipe started to corrode and create a rough surface on the inside of the pipe debris began catching and collecting within the pipe this significant amount of debris in the pipe created clogs reducing the effectiveness of the pipe leading to flooding around the troubled site after the pipe was televised and thoroughly cleaned out it was sliplined using a cured in place cip liner the liner created a smooth surface within the pipe which prevents any debris from accumulating and eliminated the eroded bottom while providing structural strength against potential future collapse the residents confirmed that the pipe functioned well without flooding thus demonstrating this project to be a success 44 localized flooding although aberdeen township has many waterways the township has only limited flooding areas that are of concern to the township itself the flooding is caused by one or two categoriesrunoff or tidal  tidal this type of flooding is normally caused by some type of storm event such as a hurricane or northeaster coincident with high tides there are several locations within the township affected by these events amboy avenue proximate to the matawan creek bridge into keyport this problem cannot be corrected due to the existing coastal wetlands and two commercial businesses  25525 general provisions  25525  on either side of the road that would be adversely impacted by raising the road and the fact that keyport would have to undertake a similar project prospect avenue at route 35 northbound the intersection would have to be raised impacting two commercial access drives the project is of low priority as an alternate route is easily accessed and the flooding frequency is low lakeshore drive between ravine drive and ocean boulevard this area floods at extreme high tides and during storm events reconstruction would be exceedingly difficult and expensive due to poor subsoils coastal wetlands on either side of the road and njdep permitting requirements however this project has a higher priority due to the higher frequency of occurrence but reconstruction could not address hurricane events beach drive at the end of shore concourse during hurricane events flooding is periodic but controlled by a municipally operated tide gate aberdeen road matawan borough extreme high tides and storm events cause road closures due to its location in an adjoining community this problem area cannot be addressed by the township  runoff this type of flooding occurs as a result of a rainfall event whereby the capacity of existing stormwater infrastructure facilities is exceeded ie a stream overflows its banks  a culvert backs up  or an inlet is clogged with debris or accumulated materials route 35 at whale creek and at long neck creek the primary cause of flooding at these locations is runoff down the stream bed exceeding the culverts capacity these floodings have occurred regardless of high tide events this problem is being addressed by njdot who has a project under final design with anticipated construction in 2007 whereby the culverts will both be increased in size to permit flow passage and the roadway elevation will be raised by approximately three 3 feet woodman place off warren drive south of lloyd road experiences roadway flooding due to deficient pipe size to carry contributory flows the municipality has this project scheduled as a capital drainage project anticipated in approximately 2008  25525 aberdeen code  25525  nutmegnormandy proximate to the nj transit railway line this area floods due to a blocked culvert currently nj transit is applying for permits to reconstruct its mainline culvert crossing and permit the secondary culvert to be cleared said project is scheduled for fall 2006 ravine drive matawan borough during severe rainfall events lake lefferts overflows its spillway causing flooding of ravine drive causing road closings several plans have been formulated to address spillway reconstruction by the borough but they lack funding for implementation the townships concern is interrupted access to other portions of its community for emergency response 45 groundwater recharge groundwater recharge is a desirable element of an overall stormwater management plan in that recharge of the groundwater maintains subsurface flows recharges potable water aquifers and supports surface stream flows during base summer months the township of aberdeens groundwater recharge areas are indicated on figure 7 however a substantial portion of said recharge areas have already been covered with developments both residential and commercial thus adversely impacting groundwater recharge rates the municipality has every intent to pursue development application review process and when appropriate and practical projects increasing groundwater recharge 46 wellhead protection wellhead protection is required to protect drinking water supply wells from contamination  the wellhead protection areas are illustrated in figure 8 wellhead protection is the primary responsibility of the potable water well owner starting with construction in accordance with njdep regulations control ownership of lands immediately surrounding the well itself and controlling the pollutant sources which can be done by but not limited to the following minimizing hazardous substance use pollution source removal education and training of operations personnel however the municipality in which the wellhead protection area is located also has an obligation to provide for and assist in the development of wellhead protection  25525 general provisions  25525  potable wells located in aberdeen are those owned and operated by new jersey american water company the townships prior potable water wells located in the cliffwood section were abandoned and sealed in accordance with the requirements of the njdep the borough of matawan has its well field located off of middlesex road south of ravine drive the borough of keyport has its wellhead off of route 35 proximate to perry street the township will pursue wellhead protection development review process with a view towards eliminating the potential for pollution andor contamination associated with stormwater facilities further the municipality will pursue education of the general public newsletters and will perform annual training of its personnel in the observation of potential pollution sources and the elimination of same 47 proactive stormwater efforts even prior to the issuance by njdep of the njpdes tier a municipal stormwater general permit the township of aberdeen has actively pursued the improvement of stormwater quality throughout the municipality some examples include revised its land development ordinances to provide for buffers of 100 from top of bank of water courses for all residential uses tree saverestore provision to replace all trees removed during site clearance or pay for differential into a tree replacement fund redefine and clarify its critical areas including steep >15% slopes update its natural

and performance standards on  the township passed adopting the design and performance standards for stormwater management measures as presented in njac 5 to minimize the adverse impact of stormwater runoff on water quality and water quantity and loss of groundwater recharge in receiving water bodies the design and performance standards include the language for maintenance of stormwater management measures consistent with the stormwater management rules at njac 58 maintenance requirements and language for safety standards consistent with njac 6 safety standards for stormwater management basins the ordinance has been submitted to the county for review and approval within 24 months of the effective date of the njpdes stormwater permit during construction township inspectors will observe the construction of approved projects to ensure that the stormwater management measures are constructed and function as designed if said measures are not taken to conform with these design standards work will be stopped a summons will be issued fines will be implemented and construction will be resumed and completed correctly will continue to inspect the stormwater facilities after construction to ensure that maintenance is performed and that facilities remain operational and structurally sound fees may be assessed against the developers or responsible partys performance or maintenance guarantees  25525 general provisions  25525  6 plan consistency the township is not within a regional stormwater management planning area and no tmdls have been developed for waters within the township  therefore this plan does not need to be consistent with any regional stormwater management plans rswmps nor any tmdls if any rswmps or tmdls are developed in the future this municipal

ordinances being revised to reference the requirements of the statutes the following additional ordinances have been adopted for their compliance with the regulations pet waste control and disposal improper disposal of waste wildlife nonfeeding illicit connection elimination of illicit connections or pollutant sources to stormwater facilities once the ordinance texts are completed they will be submitted to the county review agency for review and approval a copy will be sent to the dep at the time of submission the township will evaluate all of the different zoning districts and standards within each district with regard to impervious cover to determine whether a reduction in impervious cover is appropriate figure 9 shows existing impervious surface percentage coverages the township will also evaluate a maximum percent of disturbance for each zone for areas identified as natural features also if a developer is given a variance to exceed the maximum allowable percent of impervious cover the developer must mitigate the impact of the additional impervious surfaces including water quality flooding and groundwater recharge 8 mitigation plans this mitigation plan is provided for a proposed development residential commercial or industrial that is granted a variance or exemption from the stormwater management design and performance standards such variance or exemption include projects reviewed by the township under mlul with waiver from numerical standards and projects performed by the township under njpdes permit not in full compliance with numerical standards note that

construction the mitigation project must be implemented within the same drainage area as the proposed development if a suitable site cannot be located in the same drainage area as the proposed development the mitigation project may provide mitigation that is not equivalent to the impacts for which the variance or exemption is sought but that addresses the same issue the project must provide additional groundwater recharge benefits or protection from stormwater runoff quality and quantity from previously developed property which does not currently meet the design and performance standards

need to reduce flood losses  b represents an acceptable social and economic use of the land in relation to the hazards involved  c does not increase the danger to human plant or animal life  and d provides that no decreases in the amount of available storage for flood waters within the flood plain results from any development 5 to prohibit any other types of development including without limitation the dumping of solid or hazardous waste the construction of subsurface sewage disposal systems the storage of any petroleum products the addition or removal of fill and the altering of watercourses temporary roadways and grading and to retain areas adjacent to streams free from structures and other obstructions 6 to protect property from the adverse effects of flooding erosion loss of vegetation seepage and downstream deposits of silt gravel and stone and to prevent burdensome costs to the public arising from such damage and its repair 7 to protect other municipalities within the same watersheds from improper stream corridor development and the increased potential for flooding or for reduced stream flows in dry weather 8 to prevent disturbance to the ecological balance between wildlife plant and marine life which are dependent upon watercourses and their protective flood plains and slopes 9 to maintain the quality of streams in the township and to the extent any streams are impaired improve their quality c applicability and interpretation of flood plain and stream corridor areas regulations 1 this subsection regulates development in the following two 2 ways a

importance and harmful to the health and general welfare and to properties downstream  and b by mitigating flood hazards within flood hazard areas pursuant to the requirements of the national flood insurance program these regulations are in part intended to satisfy federal requirements in order to make flood insurance available within aberdeen township 2 except in limited cases the stream corridor requirements of subsection 2568 do not permit structures within the stream corridor as defined in subsection 2568d hereinbelow which by that definition includes flood hazard areas the flood
