backflow preventer  a device containing within its structure a minimum of two independently acting approved check valves together with an automatically operating pressure differential relief valve located between the two check valves the first check valve reduces the supply pressure a predetermined amount so that during normal flow and at cessation of normal flow the pressure between the checks shall be less than the supply pressure in case of leakage of either check valve the differential relief valve by discharging to the atmosphere shall operate to maintain the pressure between the checks less than the supply pressure the unit shall include tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the device and each device shall be fitted with properly located test cocks 3atmospheric vacuum breaker  a backflow prevention device which is operated by atmospheric pressure in combination with the force of gravity the unit is designed to work on a vertical plane only the one moving part consists of a poppet valve which must be carefully sized to slide in a guided chamber and effectively shut off the reverse flow water when a negative pressure exists 4pressure vacuum breaker  a pressure vacuum breaker is similar to an atmospheric vacuum breaker except that the checking unit poppet valve is activated by a spring this type of vacuum breaker does not require a negative pressure to react and can be used on a pressure side of a valve 5double check valve assembly  an assembly composed of two single independently acting check valves including tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly and suitable connections for testing the water tightness of each check valve a check valve is a valve that is driptight in the normal direction of flow when the inlet pressure is one psi and the outlet pressure is zero the check valve shall permit no leakage in a direction reverse to the normal flow the closure element eg clapper shall be internally weighted or otherwise internally loaded to promote rapid and positive closure 6residential dual check  a compact unit manufactured with two independent spring actuated check valves the residential dual check

in response to climate factors it therefore includes many elements that relate to protection from the sun and rain both within the building and around it the tropical old florida substyle consists mostly of lowrise construction and is characterized by simple rectilinear building configurations other elements of this substyle include such features as metal or flattiled roofs bahamian shutters arcades with arched openings extended overhangs verandahs various light filtering devices on windows eg lattices grilles louvers multipaneled doors and windows etc materials traditionally include concrete block with a smooth stucco finish and often wood sidingwith wood doors and window frames and cast stone for detailing colors are usually offwhite or light pastels bphotographic examples   iitropical contemporary architectural substyle adescription while a broad category the tropical contemporary architectural substyle is a more modern variation of florida vernacular architecture blending some tropical motifs such as climatesensitive roof forms with contemporary design elements such as vertical orientation sparsely used ornamentation verticallyoriented metal casement windows and materials such as concrete and steel structural frames and standing seam metal roofs vertical orientation is established in a variety of ways such as towers or other projections tall narrow windows exposed vertical beams real or apparent and use of colors the tropical contemporary substyle is generally found in mid to highrise construction often residential in use bphotographic examples

commission hereby finds athe city as owner and operator of the pompano beach air park is concerned with the safety and welfare of the traveling public as pilots and passengers of aircraft using runways at the air park  bcertain obstructions whether natural or manmade that intrude into airspace near runways have the potential to be hazardous to aircraft operations and endanger the lives and property of users of the air park and of occupants of land in the vicinity of the obstruction  csuch obstructions effectively reduce the size of the area available for the taking off maneuvering or landing of aircraft thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the airport and the public investment therein  dcertain activities and uses of land in the immediate vicinity of airports are not compatible with normal airport operations and may if not regulated also endanger the lives of the participants adversely affect their health or otherwise limit the accomplishment of normal activities  ethe creation or establishment of an air park hazard and the incompatible use of land in airport vicinities are public nuisances and injure the community served by the air park  fit is therefore necessary in the interest of the public health public safety and general welfare to prevent the creation or establishment of air park hazards and limit land use incompatible with normal air park operations  and gthe prevention of these hazards limitation of incompatible land uses and the elimination removal alteration mitigation or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards should be accomplished to the extent legally possible by the exercise of the police power of the city 2purpose it is the purpose of the air park overlay apo district to recognize an area adjacent to the runways of the pompano beach air park in which obstructions and incompatible land uses may pose a hazard to safe air park operations and to apply reasonable regulations that prevent such obstructions and limit such incompatible uses and are consistent with fs ch 333 airport zoning and the standards for civilian airports established by the federal aviation administration faa the standards contained herein reflect the character of the flying operations expected to be conducted at the pompano beach air park the nature of the terrain within the air park hazard area and runway protection zones the
