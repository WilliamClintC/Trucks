and architectural features of the surrounding homes new construction in the nez should not attempt to recreate or replicate a past architectural style in its entirety but should take cues from the architectural and design elements of surrounding historic structures no specific architectural style shall be required for new construction in the nez the following aspects of new construction in the nez should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which the new construction is related these include but are not limited to height proportion between width and height of faade proportion and relationship between doors and windows rhythm of solids and voids created by openings in the faade materials textures colors patterns trims and design of the roof new construction in the nez should also preserve the existing rhythm created by existing building masses in the neighborhood height all new construction in the nez should take into consideration the general height of the buildings in the neighborhood and shall also comply with the regulating zoning district proportion of the buildings front faade the relationship of the width to height of a building creates a proportion that should be taken into consideration such as tall and narrow low and squat or square this proportional relationship should reflect the dominant character of the neighborhood proportion of openings within the faade this is a relationship of the width to height of windows and doors for example a window may be one unit wide and three units high thus creating a proportional relationship of  if the majority of the buildings within a neighborhood have this  relationship then new design should reflect this proportion as well large picture windows or horizontal bands of windows should be avoided modern interpretations of historic windows are acceptable if they retain the historic size ratios and pattern of placement on the faade doors should also be compatible in proportion see illustration 1 rhythm of solids to voids rhythm is an ordered recurrent alternation of wall to openings as well as spacing between buildings this rhythm creates a feel as one moves past a building or group of buildings the design of a new structure in the nez should respect the rhythm of the surrounding neighborhood in terms of its size distance between buildings on either side and the spacing of windows and doors see illustration 2 relationship of materials new designs in the nez should use materials that are compatible with the neighborhood and should seek to reflect the predominant materials found in the neighborhood if the majority of existing buildings are brick then the proposed building should be brick if the predominant material is lap siding then the proposed material should be lap siding the texture and color of the materials should be considered as well and be compatible with the surrounding buildings relationship to roof shapes roof shape includes the type and pitch of the roof such as hip gable mansard or shed the treatment of the eaves rafter tails soffits bargeboards and fascia are important considerations when designing any new construction in the nez for example if the majority of the existing houses in a neighborhood have a gabled roof then the proposed new construction should have a gabled roof additionally if the existing buildings in a neighborhood have boxed eaves then the new construction should seek to either incorporate the same or similar design element relationships to architectural details architectural details include features such as cornices brackets columns lintels arches roof crests quoins balustrades doors windows and chimneys new construction in the nez should be compatible with the predominant architectural details on surrounding buildings these details do not need to be copied in the new construction but they should be reflected in some manner for example if the majority of houses in the neighborhood have pediments above the windows then the new construction should reflect pedimentlike features above the windows as well additionally chimneys that are not constructed of historical materials brick or stone should be located to the rear of the building in order to reduce the visibility of the modern chimney covering from the public rightofway scale scale is created by the architectural detailing that relates to the size of a human and by the building mass as it relates to open space a large building on a small lot has a different appearance when compared to a large building on a large lot this relationship should be considered when designing for a particular neighborhood new construction in the nez should observe the scale of surrounding and nearby structures the window and door lines should be similar to neighboring structures the detailing should be consistent with the size of the building for example a small house should not have massive or oversized details and decorations massing the term massing refers to how the basic shapes of the building are fit together massing can be very simple such as a single rectangular shape be more complex with an lshape or have a combination of shapes additional massing elements are also found among the different architectural styles for example in victorian architecture elements such as bays towers and turrets add to the basic massing of the house massing patterns of the neighborhood structures should be considered and reflected in the design of new construction in the nez new construction in the nez shall also comply with the floorarea ratios dictated by the regulating zoning district directional expression of the front elevation the use of architectural details and the proportion of the width to height ratio create structural shape the structural shape will be expressed either vertically or horizontally a building with a ratio of  will have a vertical appearance while a ratio of  would have a horizontal appearance tall narrow windows give a vertical appearance while wide windows tend to create a horizontal feel new construction in the nez should observe the predominant feel of the surrounding area rhythm of spacing and setbacks it is important that new construction in the nez be consistent with adjacent structures in spacing and setback which sets a rhythm for the block and neighborhood and is a part of the historic character the setback of new construction in the nez should generally be within 10 percent of the setback lines of the adjacent structures setbacks for new construction in the nez should maintain the existing pattern of setbacks in the block if at all possible new construction in the nez shall also comply with the setbacks dictated by the regulating zoning district see illustration 3 variation of styles if groupings of two or more new homes are being built in the same area then the new construction should reflect a variation in the styles of homes it is not appropriate to build the same home or simply change the position of the front porch or the type of window or front door to comply with these criteria  262007   412008   11192013   12152015   162018

83 3 ultrasonic 167 4 ultrasonic 333 6 ultrasonic 533 8 ultrasonic 933 10 to 12 ultrasonic 1833 accordingly the number of service units for each meter size and meter type follows the same ratio and is used to determine the proportional water and wastewater impact fee for each meter size and meter type compared to a simple inch water meter e if the building permit for which an impact fee has been paid has expired and a new application is thereafter filed the impact fees shall be computed using the schedule 2 then in effect with credits for previous payment of fees being applied against the new

 generally title this article shall be known as the official stormwater management ordinance of the city  922014 statutory authorization the legislature of the state of texas has in the flood control insurance act texas water  delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city has adopted this article as follows  922014 findings of fact a the drainageways creeks and flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation that may result in the loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affects the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains that increase flood heights and velocities and by placing structures and other improvements that are vulnerable to floods in flood hazard areas c the development of land causes large quantities of soil to be displaced and transported to downstream locations this soil displacement can create significant soil erosion and sedimentation problems erosion is a dangerous activity in that it contaminates water supplies and water resources a buildup of sediment degrades water quality destroys valuable environmental resources and clogs watercourses and storm drains which can cause flooding thereby damaging public and private lands and property these problems result in a serious threat to the health safety and general welfare of the city d creek and floodplain areas in the city are valuable resources to the citizens of the city in that they provide recreational opportunities improve the aesthetics of the community convey stormwater runoff and filter out water quality pollutants as valuable resources creeks and floodplains warrant protection e the development of land can cause significant changes in the manner quality frequency rate and volume of stormwater runoff entering a stream or lake changes in stormwater runoff can upset the natural balance of erosion and deposition in lakes and streams resulting in increased flooding and loss of bank stability thus endangering adjacent public and private improvements and causing impacts to lake and stream characteristics that are generally viewed as negative  922014 statement of purpose this article sets forth the minimum requirements necessary to provide and maintain a safe efficient and effective drainage system within the city and to establish the various public and private responsibilities for the provision thereof further it is the purpose of this article to 1 protect human life health and property  2 minimize the expenditure of public money for building and maintaining flood control and storm drainage projects and cleaning sediment out of storm drains streets sidewalks and watercourses  3 minimize damage due to drainage and erosion to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric service telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges  4 help maintain a stable tax base and preserve land values  5 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  6 ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  7 preserve the natural beauty and aesthetics of the community  8 control and manage stormwater runoff and the sediment load in that runoff from points and surfaces within subdivisions  9 establish a reasonable standard of design for development that prevents potential flood and erosion damage  and 10 reduce the pollutant loading to streams ponds and other watercourses  922014 stormwater management policy a purpose stormwater management policies shall govern the planning design construction operation and maintenance of storm drainage and erosion control facilities within the city this stormwater management policy is written for purposes of instruction to city staff to give guidance to draft changes to our current stormwater ordinance for this policy to be enforceable the ordinance must be amended to reflect this policy and approved by the city council public hearing process b design standards it is the policy of the city to adopt and maintain design standards that protect and provide for the safety and general welfare of the community c drainage and erosion control standards it is the policy of the city to implement drainage and erosion control standards to minimize flood damage and soil erosion to private and public facilities within the community and to protect water quality d review and permit process the review and permit process established under division 2 of this article shall be utilized by the city to provide control of development activities related to erosion control and stormwater runoff constructed facilities e implementation these stormwater management policies are defined by stormwater management ordinance no 177 adopted on  and amendments thereto all amendments additions or modifications to this article

property shall be in keeping with the future land use plan these urban design standards and guidelines are implemented by means of an overlay zoning district for the rec and these standards and guidelines are applicable in the rec base zoning districts the purpose of these standards and guidelines is to allow for the development of fully integrated pedestrianoriented neighborhoods corridors and districts in the rec the intent is to minimize traffic congestion relative infrastructure costs and environmental degradation while improving quality of life and promoting the health safety and welfare of neighborhood communities the standards and guidelines are based on the following principles all neighborhoods have identifiable centers and edgesshopping recreation and basic neighborhood services are accessible by nonvehicular means in the neighborhoodseach neighborhood shall provide a mixeduse neighborhood center accessible by walking no more than onehalf mileuses and housing types are mixed and in close proximity to one another utilizing urban design to facilitate the compatibility of different usesthe streets blocks and the placement of buildings on lots encourage pedestrian activitystreets are interconnected forming a networkcivic buildings and civic space are given prominent sitesparks are evenly distributed throughout neighborhoodswithin onequarter of a mile from most dwelling unitsschools are located within a tenminute walk or onehalf mile from a majority of the dwelling units in a neighborhoodboverlay categories the design standards are organized and divided into three overlay zoning categories these overlay categories will match appropriate urban design with the desired vision for a given area while maintaining the projected tax base profile of the rec as generally established in the future land use plan the three overlay categories are as follows 1neighborhood zone intent and purpose each development shall be predicated on the neighborhood as the basic unit of development with a distinct edge and center that provides the location for the neighborhoods civic buildings eg churches libraries and meeting halls primary civic open spaces and primary neighborhood commercial uses generally larger residential lots should be strategically located so that higher intensity residential development is located within and adjacent to neighborhood activity centers 2the collinmckinney parkway corridor zone intentpurpose this zone shall provide opportunities for the public to live work shop walk bicycle and drive within and rec and adjacent developments while minimizing conflicts between different modes  to promote an orderly visually pleasing and active street and parkway environment for workers residents and visitors  to accommodate the automobile but not at the expense of the pedestrian  to provide adequate and efficient servicing of the development by trucks and utility vehicles throughout the rec but to minimize the visual and auditory impact of such service  to strengthen relationships and encourage movement between important destinations inside and outside the development 3commercialemployment zone intentpurpose commercialemployment districts are located principally along sh 121 and in some locations along custer road the intended uses in these districts are large employers involved in commerciallight industrial activity that are dependent upon sh 121 and are not easily incorporated into the fabric of a town center or neighborhood buildings of all sizes large and small are allowed in commercialemployment districts as are the associated parking lots loading and shipping facilities of light industrial activity residential uses are permitted above nonresidential uses to promote with
