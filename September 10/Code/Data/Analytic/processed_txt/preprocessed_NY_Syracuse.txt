paraprofessional category goals and timetable the primary goal of the affirmative action plan of the city of syracuse is to ensure equality of employment opportunity to all people without regard to race color sex religion creed age 18 and over marital status national origin disability or vietnam era veteran status in order to achieve this goal the affirmative action officer shall review all personnel policies practices and procedures in order to correct any deficiencies in the employment system which may have inhibiting effects in achieving equal employment opportunity for all employees and applicants each city department shall be reviewed in order to develop and implement affirmative action policies to meet and overcome any artificial barriers and obstacles to the employment of protected class members ie members of racial religious or ethnic minority groups women individuals with disabilities and vietnam era veterans the ultimate goal is to achieve and maintain employment levels for these groups commensurate with their representation in the citys population 1 minority analysis minorities constitute 187 percent of the city population 12 percent of the city workforce and 173 percent of the syracuse labor market one of the citys goals is to increase the proportion of minorities on city payroll to 173 percent by 1990 the city payroll is expected to remain relatively constant at approximately 2000 for the next several years the ideal goal would be to achieve minority employment proportional to the percentage of minority group members in the population since the city is required to hire according to civil service regulations and other restraints the goal of achieving minority employment proportional to labor market representation is more realistic it is recognized that union contractual posting and bidding job requirements for noncompetitive and labor class positions as well as the civil service testing system for competitive positions will affect the rate at which new minority employees can be brought into city government nevertheless it is anticipated that the 173 percent rate for 1990 is attainable with increased sensitivity to and awareness of the needs of minorities coupled with aggressive recruitment the goal will be reevaluated as part of the annual review of the affirmative action plan as indicated by the minority analysis table in minority representation among officials and administrators is 8 percent and already above the labor market representation of 3 percent  no increase is indicated in this category for other categories the goal of the citys affirmative action plan is to increase minority representation in the workforce by 1990 as follows category minimum percent by 1990 professionals 3 technicians 6 protective service 3 officeclerical 4 skilled craft 9 service maintenance 2 a further goal is to encourage upward mobility within the professional technician and protective service categories to increase minority representation at all levels including supervisory an additional goal is to encourage officeclerical workers and paraprofessionals to advance into the professional ranks 2 female analysis in the city of syracuse women presently constitute 15 percent of the workforce and 469 percent of the labor market this difference in proportions between the citys workforce and labor market is attributed to several factors a lack of female interest in the job titles which fall into the skilled craft and servicemaintenance job categoriesthese two 2 categories represent 33 percent of the total workforce and men occupy 96 percent of the jobs  b contractual posting and bidding requirements  and c civil service examination selection procedures the present goal is to remove any artificial barriers which discourage women from applying for jobs in the skilled craft service maintenance and protective services areas by aggressive recruiting and by advising female candidates of the opportunities available in these job categories significant improvements can be made in the proportions of females in the city workforce the goal of the citys affirmative action plan is to increase female representation in the workforce as follows category minimum percent by 1990 minimum percent by 1995 officials administrators 7 no change professionals 13 18 technicians 30 39 protective service workers 6 12 skilled craft workers 2 no change service maintenance 6 9 additionally the city shall continue to encourage women in the paraprofessional job category which has the highest proportion of women of all categories to seek advancement into the professional protective service and technical groups advancement within these categories will also be encouraged to increase female representation at all levels including supervisory these goals will be reevaluated in conjunction with the annual review of the affirmative action plan 3 disabled workers analysis the new york state department of labor reported that 41 percent of the 1980 syracuse labor force had a work disability although it is difficult to identify every disabled city worker because some disabilities are not readily identifiable and because of the sensitive issue of invasion of privacy the city has been able to ascertain that the citys disabled workforce is comparable to the proportion of disabled workers in the labor market steps have been taken to assure that employees and job applicants are aware of the citys policies of nondiscrimination toward disabled persons the following statement has been added to the citys employment application and to job announcements pursuant to federal regulation 31 cfr the city of syracuse does not discriminate on the basis of handicapped status in admission or access to or treatment or employment in its programs and activities if you have a disability for which you wish special accommodations please contact the department of personnel 217 city hall syracuse new york

possession of aerosol spray paint can and broadtipped indelible marker legislative intent the common council finds that the problem of defacement of public and private property use of aerosol spray paint cans and broadtipped indelible markers has reached such proportions that laws designated to deter such acts of vandalism should be strengthened the council further finds that in many cases the

of neighborhoods and prevents the creation of an attractive business district  and that such defacement of property is most often committed by persons under the age of eighteen 18 years of age using

protections against discrimination for persons in the city of syracuse based on individual characteristics or circumstances that do not receive explicit protection in existing state county or federal human and civil rights laws the intent of this law when created and amendments has been to deter and prevent the harms that can result from such discrimination in 199 the city of syracuse enacted a fair practices law local law no 17 in order to extend such human rights protections on the basis of sexual orientation within the city of syracuse in 199 onondaga county followed by enacting a similar fair practices law local law no 2 which extended these protections throughout the county in late 200 new york state amended its human rights law executive law  by enacting the sexual orientation nondiscrimination act sonda in order to extend these protections throughout the state in 201 the city of syracuse law no 72012 amended its fair practices law local law no 17 in order to extend such human rights protections on the bases of actual or perceived sex gender identity or expression the state and federal governments have not yet to enacted any human rights laws that would guarantee protection against housing discrimination based on the sources of income on which a person relies wholly or in part to ensure payment of rent to a landlord nationwide more than five million people utilize vouchers provided by the federal housing choice voucher program other types of subsidies used by people living in syracuse to ensure payment of rent to a landlord can include social security supplemental security income ssi other types of vouchers state or federal disability programs foster care programs disability or unemployment insurance pensions or annuities public assistance child support alimony or veterans benefits discrimination against voucher holders and recipients of other subsidies can severely limit the housing choices that are available to these individuals and families and can perpetuate patterns of racial ethnic and economic segregation currently landlords in the city of syracuse can turn away families solely because they will rely on a subsidy or other lawful source of income from a third party to pay all or part of their rent this can make it difficult for a person to find safe and affordable housing for themselves and their dependents and ultimately negate the effectiveness of government supported housing assistance programs a landlords refusal to consider a person as a tenant based on the a lawful source of income on which they would rely to pay rent may also be a proxy for discrimination based on race or disability that would otherwise be illegal thirteen 13 states and more than forty 40 localities across the us have enacted legislation banning housing discrimination based on the sources of income on which a person would rely to ensure payment of rent to a landlord in new york state the following jurisdictions have passed such laws the city of buffalo and new york city nassau county suffolk county westchester county and the towns of hamburg and west seneca the purpose of this amendment to the fair practices law is to ensure under the police powers granted to the city of syracuse that every individual in the city of syracuse shall also enjoy protection from housing discrimination based upon the sources of income upon which a person may rely to pay rent this amendment is intended to eliminate and prevent such discrimination and thereby increase the diversity of rental housing choices available throughout the city of syracuse therefore it is the finding of this common council that as a matter of public policy and pursuant to the citys general police powers that landlords in syracuse should not be able to turn away individuals based on their sexual orientation their actual or perceived sex or gender identity or expression and neither should landlords be able to turn away individuals or families solely because a head of household will rely on subsidies to pay all or part of their rent furthermore it is the finding and policy of this common council that this local law is intended to ensure under the police powers granted to the city of syracuse that every individual shall enjoy protection from discrimination in employment housing and places of public accommodation resort or amusement based on their actual or perceived sex or their gender identity and enjoy protection from housing discrimination based on the sources of income upon which they rely to pay rent this law was created and has been amended to eliminate such forms of discrimination and to prevent the resulting harm to individuals and families throughout the city of syracuse ll no 17199 art i  ll no 7201 111912  ll no 72016

plan lmp adopted on  and amended and reconfirmed on  the purpose of this ix is to implement the lmp and the principles of the onondaga county settlement plan hereinafter the settlement plan within the lakefront area these principles are aimed at building a traditional urban fabric characterized by streets and other public spaces that are walkable and inviting to pedestrians and by a mixture of uses including retail office personal services restaurants waterfront recreation and residential integrated in a finegrained pattern that creates an urban sense of place with energy and vitality another important element of the lakefront area is the potential for tourismbased retail and entertainment venues within a high quality resort atmosphere centered upon the current retail and inner harbor areas within the lmp and integrating with the urban and recreation opportunities within the surrounding areas the zoning categories in this based upon the transect concept which enables neighborhoods to be designed as coherent environments arranged in a continuum from rural to urban rather than regulation based primarily on uses and dimensions this type of land use regulation focuses on the creation of a dignified public realm with interconnecting streets lined with buildings because the uses are varied they are harmonized using regulations that address design issues such as building type and placement facades streetscapes and street layout based upon the transect model the lakefront has been divided into two urban transect categories described as general urban t4 and urban center t5 it is possible that other parts of the city of syracuse may also be rezoned according to transect categories this intended to implement the general goals principles and intent of the lmp and the settlement plan which shall be used as interpretive guidance documents and not as the governing law for these districts the settlement plan describes the transect in greater detail drawings maps and

a shopfront facade aligned on the frontage line with either an attached colonnade or a second story of the building extending over the sidewalk while the ground story remains set back at the frontage line this type is appropriate for retail use as long as the sidewalk is fully absorbed within the arcade so that a pedestrian cannot bypass it an easement for private use of the public rightofway is usually required to be useful the arcade should be no less than 12 feet  wide shopfront a facade aligned at or close to the frontage line with extensive glazing and the entrance at sidewalk grade this type is conventional for retail frontage it is commonly equipped with cantilevered shed roof or an awning the absence of a raised ground story precludes residential use on the ground floor although this use is appropriate on upper stories stoop a facade aligned close to the frontage line with the ground story elevated from the sidewalk and a raised stoop and steps projecting from the entrance the elevated facade increases privacy for the windows this type is suitable for groundfloor residential uses at short setbacks with rowhouses and apartment buildings an easement may be necessary to accommodate the encroaching stoop this type may be interspersed with the shopfront forecourt a facade aligned close to the frontage line with a portion of it set back the forecourt created is suitable for gardens vehicular dropoffs and utility off loading this type should be used sparingly and in conjunction with the two frontage types above as a continuous excessive setback is boring and unsafe for pedestrians trees within the forecourts should be placed to have their canopies overhanging the sidewalks terrace and light court a facade set back from the frontage line with an elevated garden or terrace or a sunken light court this type can effectively buffer residential quarters from the sidewalk while removing the private yard from public encroachment the terrace is suitable for restaurants and cafes as the eye of the sitter is level with that of the standing passerby the light court can give light and access to a basement porch and fence a facade set back from the frontage line with an encroaching porch appended and a low fence at the frontage line the porch should be within a conversational distance of the sidewalk while a fence at the frontage line maintains the demarcation of the yard a great variety of porches is possible but to be useful none should be less than 8 feet  wide bix4 10 common lawn a facade set back substantially from the frontage line the front yard thus created should remain unfenced and be visually continuous with adjacent yards the ideal is to simulate buildings sitting in a common lawn area a front porch is optional as social interaction from the enfronting street is unlikely at such a distance common lawns are suitable frontages for higher speed streets as the large setback provides a buffer from the traffic gallery see frontage type green see civic space layer the depth of the lot within which certain activities or structures are permitted the first layer is the area between the frontage line and the facade the second layer is the area starting at the facade to a depth of 20 feet  the third layer is the area starting 20 feet  behind the front only facade to the rear lot line buildings set at the frontage line have no first layer light court see frontage type liner building a shallow building designed to screen a parking lot parking structure or blank wall lot width the dimension of a lot measured along the frontage line outbuilding see principal building park see civic space parking structure a building containing two or more stories of parking parking structures create negative pedestrian experiences along the frontages unless there is retail frontage in the parking structure or in liner buildings at the street level passage a pedestrian connector passing between buildings passages

applicable only in the t5  franklin square subdistrict 1 architecture generally t5  only the architecture within t5  subdistrict is characterized by low to midrise industrial buildings predominantly of brick construction the buildings date from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries many of the older buildings feature stone foundations while some of the relatively newer buildings are framed with reinforced concrete however it is the use of brick as the primary building material and its characteristics of color texture and opportunities for surface embellishment and detail which define the architectural idiom for the district the urban design feature that gives the district its unique identity is this architectural idiom the similarity of architectural characteristics among the district buildings creates a consistency in scale texture and pattern that reinforces an overall district identity 2 facade openings fenestration t5  only the architectural harmony of the district

color bix4 22 3 color and materials t5  only the dominant facade colors within the district are the earth tones and reds of the existing brick facades this range of colors provides visual consistency and unity the dominant colors of building facades are enhanced use of accent colors for the trim and detailing of the facade a no more than two building materials in addition to glass may be used as exterior cladding and brick shall be the dominant cladding material the brick shall be compatible to adjacent structures in terms of color and size b the following cladding materials for building

pedestrian experiences that invite pedestrians to walk from one block to the next the practical need to allow access to buildings by trucks and to parking lots by motorists may conflict with this objective because of the disruptive nature of service and parking lot frontages and access facilities this conflict can be mitigated by designating a streets which create a continuous street network where the pedestrian experience has first priority and b streets which accommodate the service requirements of cars and trucks in order to optimize the quality of the pedestrian experience on a streets b streets are allowed to have more flexible requirements for building frontages b permitted exemptions building frontages along streets designated as b streets in the regulating plan may be exempted from the building disposition and building configuration requirements of this ix c the zoning administrator may grant a permitted exemption for a b street in conjunction with a site plan review application provided that the zoning administrator finds such an exemption is necessary for efficient vehicular and service access to buildings enfronting a streets to minimize disruption of

overlay district 1 purpose and intent  under conventional zoning district provisions motor vehicle sales businesses are permitted or prohibited on the basis of categories of use for the most part the conventional districts lack an effective means of accommodating new or expanded businesses in appropriate instances missing is an accommodation based on compatibility of specific designs and layouts and positive interrelationships with the surrounding areas the same districts that affect motor vehicle sales businesses in corridors such as automobile row are also found other parts of the city and are unrelated to motor vehicle sales the utility of possibly adding special permit or site review provisions to those districts in order to accommodate the motor vehicle sales businesses is diminished because of the effect on the unrelated areas the alternative of changing the existing zoning districts to a more permissive district is likewise inappropriate a new district would bring with it an array of potentially adverse or unwanted new uses and activities hence the need has arisen for independently derived overlay district allowances an overlay district by means of the provisions contained herein shall provide the opportunity for controlled development of specified components of the motor vehicle sales businesses areas where these components would not otherwise be allowed shall be permitted within the overlay district boundaries 2 core district  the overlay district must have at its core a principal zoning district such as a commercial or industrial district that permits motor vehicle sales as a matter of right more restrictive zoning districts that do not permit motor vehicle sales as a matter of right may be included in the overlay district provided they are contiguous to the core district or form uninterrupted blocks extending from the core district along the principal arterial street on which the core district is located the overlay district may also be extended across a street immediately parallel to the principal arterial street if it is shown that the far side of the street would be isolated between the overlay district and another zoning district in which motor vehicle sales is already permitted as a matter of right 3 general limitation on permitted functions and activities  the overlay district as a means of establishing and protecting a viable corridor of motor vehicle sales businesses shall extend the range of permitted uses within the underlying zoning districts only to include a new motor vehicle sales dealerships and related accessory functions and b fullfunction used motor vehicle sales businesses a new motor vehicle sales businesses  these may include repair and service functions rentals and used motor vehicle sales
