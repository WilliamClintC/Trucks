exceeding the requirements of tables 1110b 1110c and 1110e for any such use allowed as a conditional use if it finds such higher standards necessary to ensure com patibility of the use with the surrounding residential environment e lot size averaging 1 purpose this division is intended to allow flexibility in the planning of residential subdivisions  to facilitate the preservation on private home lots of mature trees rock outcroppings  and other natural amenities and to aid in the development of oddshaped tracts 2 lot area and width reductions individual single and twofamily lots may have lot areas per dwelling unit and lot widths smaller than the minimum requirements provided in tables 1110b and 1110c subject to the restrictions of division e3 3 restrictions a average area & width the

density transfer in lc district 1 purpose to both protect property rights and encourage the preservation of open space and environmentally sensitive areas it is desirable to minimize the loss of value and utility occasioned by either a regulatory requirement to preserve open land on private property or by voluntary action to do so this division therefore allows a portion of a parcel that is classified in the lc land conservation district to attribute its development rights to the balance of the same parcel this will allow total quantitative development rights for number of dwelling units or amount of floor area to remain the same as they would be without the lc restrictions 2 modification of dimensional requirements a lot area and width land and water area located in the lc district may be counted together with land zoned in other districts on the same property for purposes of computing number of dwelling units or amount of floor area allowed on such other land lot or building site areas and widths may be smaller than otherwise required in the applicable zoning district as provided in table 1110f as modified by ther minimums specified in division f3 b building height the planning director shall approve the smallest exception to maximum building height allowed herein that he or she determines necessary for the exercise of the rights created by density transfer maximum building height approved hereunder within 100 feet of a property in a district other than the lc district shall not exceed the maximum building height allowed by that district except where the district boundary is along an arterial street or freeway 3 minimum lot dimensions notwithstanding other provisions herein no lot dimensions shall be less than as follows  lot area in square feet  ra

the park and recreation commission b bonus intensity property not classifiable in the lc district on the basis of an environmental characteristic under division f4b but voluntarily proposed for lc zoning by the property owner shall receive a bonus in the intensity of development permitted thereupon as provided in table 1110f c rezoning criteria for land having no environmental feature requiring preservation the planning commission and city council shall in deciding whether to classify it in the lc district take into account 1 the interest of the park and recreation commission or other public body in acquiring the property 2 the adequacy of any homeowners association or other arrangement for preserving perpetually as open space and providing for the maintenance of any land that is not to be dedidedicated to the public 3 the provision of adequate open space buffers bordering areas developed in or if undeveloped zoned for a lowerdensity residential use than the land on the parcel that is not to be zoned lc 6 nonlc open spaces no density transfer hereunder shall be allowed from land required to be provided as a yard lawn landscaped area stormwater detention or retention area or

7 of the printed version of the barberton development i transition overlay districts 1 purpose one of the obstacles to a desirable transition from one land use to another is the time and expense that can be associated with a petition for rezoning and the uncertainty of the outcome this is especially the case in a fully developed city like barberton where land use changes can affect nearby properties to an greater degree than elsewhere and when properties are rezoned in advance of need existing uses are made nonconforming a status that can discourage investment in maintenance and property improvement from time to time the city may desire nonetheless in selected areas to give special encouragement to land use transition and its attendant investment development and job creation especially for largerscale developments transition overlay districts tods are intended to provide a way for the city to reduce the uncertainties associated with future land use changes without creating nonconformities tods are designed to facilitate and encourage particular land use transitions in selected areas by in effect rezoning in advance for a successor land use tods allow the city to grant additional asofright development rights to a property in advance of need enhancing the development potential of particular sites in a way that avoids the uncertainties attendant to future decisions on rezoning and avoids the creation of nonconformities 2 establishment of tods any nonoverlay zoning district established in this chapter may be established on a parcel as a transition overlay district tod no more than one tod shall be established on any parcel such designation may be shown on the zoning district map as the name of the district for example o2 followed by the letter t for example o2 t such overlay district shall be interpreted as supplementing and not replacing the underlying zoning of the property procedures for establishment of a tod on a property shall be as

underlying district are exclusive and not cumulative the certificate of compliance shall be based on conformity with either the provisions of the underlying district or those of the transition overlay district noncompliance with the requirements of a tod before it is used in lieu of the underlying district shall not be considered a violation or a nonconformity 3change in underlying district when a particular zoning classification is established hereunder as an overlay on a property such overlay is intended to be the sole means of adding the rights attendant to such classification to those already enjoyed by that property no application shall therefore be accepted under amendments to change the underlying zoning classification to the same classification currently established as the tod this restriction shall not be interpreted to prevent an application for a change in the underlying zoning to any other classification 4terminationof underlying zoning at the time of issuance of a certificate of occupancy for a lot conforming to the regulations of a tod the underlying zoning classification shall automatically cease the building commissioner shall remove such classification from the zoning district map at the next updating thereof and record the tod as the new underlying zoning classification of the property 5conditions for use of tod no certificate of compliance shall be issued under provisions of a transition overlay district for any property unless the conditions specified in this division have been complied with aparcel size the parcel utilizing the tod

land planning and improvements parking loading & vehicular areas a purpose parking and loading facilities located offstreet are desirable to enhance access to land uses and reduce congestion and hazards on public streets such facilities are however often difficult to provide in neighborhoods that were developed before automobile and truck usage and the provision of off street parking and loading became common and the provision of offstreet facilities can at times even be detrimental to the character of older parts of the city the provisions of this chapter therefore attempt to balance the benefits to the city of offstreet parking and loading facilities with the physical and economic obstacles to their provision and with the desirability of retaining barbertons traditional character this chapter sets requirements for offstreet parking loading and other areas utilized by motor vehicles to reduce congestion and traffic hazards provide proper access to land uses and maintain and

reduce the number of required parking spaces under division d shall be reported in writing within 5 days of the action to the building commissioner c change in eligibility for reduction a use that provides a reduced number of spaces as permitted herein but ceases to comply with the applicable requirements therefor for any reason and does not then supply the number of spaces required without the reduction shall become nonconforming with respect to the number of spaces a parking reserve area under division e may be required in order to prevent such nonconformity a use that did not initially comply with the requirements for a reduction including the required approval specified but that later complies shall qualify for the reduction subject to the other provisions herein 2 types of reductions a uses sharing patrons and employees the building commissioner may find based on data submitted by the applicant that a use requiring parking is combined with a second use utilizing the same parking area that 1 serves as a subsidiary use and 2 shares all its employees with the first use and 3 is normally utilized by customers visitors or employees only as part of a stop to utilize the first use upon making such findings he or she shall waive the spaces required for the second use for example a service station with a convenience food store that is sub sidiary to the station is normally patronized only while doing business with the service station and is serviced by the same employees shall be required to provide only the spaces required for the service station b captive market uses the planning commission may determine that a use not qualifying under division d2 does not require the normal amount of parking because it benefits from a captive market with a captive market a use draws a significant number of customers or visitors who do not arrive at the use by motor vehicle because the use is located on the same lot as or within walking distance of a second use or uses that generate such customer or visitor traffic for example a restaurant located in an office building may draw some customers from the offices therein and may not therefore require parking for those customers or a convenience market may be located close enough to a concentration of housing to draw pedestrian traffic therefrom the commission may in such cases reduce the parking required for the first use by an amount approximating the percentage of captive market patronage accounted for by the second use c reduction for employee spaces demand reduction the planning commission may reduce the number of spaces required for the employees of a use if the use submits binding written agreements approved as legally sufficient by the director of law for the institution of and continuing maintenance by an employer of programs likely in the judgment of the commission to significantly reduce demand for employee parking such programs may involve car pooling subsidy of employee bus fares charging employees for parking or other measures d reduction for use of onstreet spaces the planing commission may approve as a special exception the crediting toward required parking spaces of one onstreet space per 20 feet of street frontage located within the applicable distance specified in division 121006 b2 excluding driveways and noparking areas to approve such crediting the commission shall find that 1 such spaces will be reasonably available to the use and 2 without such crediting provision of the required number of spaces less all other applicable reductions provided by this division is impractical e reduction for senior housing the planning commission may as a special exception reduce by no more than 50 percent the number of spaces required for multifamily residential buildings upon finding that 1 such buildings consist of not less than 90 percent senior citizen dwelling units as defined herein and 2 probable lower vehicle ownership among residents as evidenced by data submitted by the applicant will reduce resident parking demand f reduction under pud the number of required spaces may be reduced for a development approved under planned unit development procedures as provided in g other reductions the number of required spaces may be reduced on the basis of alternative data on parking space needs under division 121003b2 timeshared parking under division 121003b4 or by variance under division 121003a1 e parking reserve areas 1 when required an on or offsite open area reserved for possible future conversion to parking may be required as a condition of a reduction in the number of required parking spaces under division 121003b or 121004d or other provision of this determining whether to require such an area the applicable review body shall consider a the likelihood of a future need for additional parking and b the availability of land therefor either on the site or within the distances specified for offsite parking in division 121006b2 2 size of reserve area the reserve area shall be large enough to accommodate in surface parking a number of parking spaces equal to the difference between a the number of spaces provided for the use and b the number required by table 1210a or 1210c without the reductions that require a reserve area the site plan required by table 1320c shall show the boundaries of the reserve area 3 use of reserve area a parking reserve area shall be used only for open space outdoor recreation outside storage where permitted or other purposes that would not impose significant obstacles to its later conversion to parking vegetative ground cover shall be installed and maintained in all areas not requiring a different surface for any such use 4 other requirements a parking reserve area shall be sized located and otherwise arranged so as to allow upon its conversion to parking conformance to all requirements of city regulations that applied to offstreet parking at the time of its original installation 5 covenant and guarantee prior to the issuance of a certificate of com pliance for any use required to provide a parking reserve area the applicant for the certificate shall execute and record with the summit or wayne county recorder as applicable a covenant running with the land for the benefit of the city of barberton the covenant shall specify that at such time as the city determines that eligibility has ceased for an applicable parking space reduction utilized on the property the property owner will install the number of reserve spaces or any portion thereof specified by the building commissioner within 90 days of the date of the commissioners written request or within any extension thereof that he or she may grant the commissioner shall make such request only upon determining that the spaces required to be installed are necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter the covenant shall remain in effect until the number of reserve spaces has been reduced to zero the property owner shall provide a financial guarantee of future installation of parking in the reserve area until such time as the city has determined the reserve area is no longer needed for additional parking the guarantee shall conform to the requirements of 04 number of parking spaces required a parking of commercial vehicles 1 applicability the requirements of this division a shall

the adverse effects on public streets and adjacent properties of noise blowing dust and debris water runoff and glare from motor vehicle headlights and parking area lighting d discourage unsafe access to and circulation within offstreet parking areas e contribute to improved community appearance and property values f preserve privacy in residential areas next to nonresidential uses and discourage trespass thereupon and g provide trees that improve the urban environment by cooling the air and land reducing carbon dioxide in the air and producing oxygen it is further the objective of these regulations to relieve property owners of the large setback requirements that are typically used in other cities to buffer neighboring usesbut which are difficult to achieve on barbertons smaller

single simple common geometric form such as rectangle square circle or oval is often preferable to a more elaborate shape or combination of shapes 2 color colors used should provide sufficient contrast between the message and the background of the sign to assure readability use of no more than 4 colors including black and white and the background color of the sign is preferable use of bright colors as accents is preferred to their use as dominant colors dark subdued hues are preferred to deemphasize visible support structures like pylons or projecting sign hangers especially if such structures are not ornamental 3 materials the simple classic beauty of traditional natural materials like wood stone or brick is often preferable if such materials are largely unpainted but rated for exterior exposure so that their natural beauty is exposed 4 lettering size lettering on signs intended to be read from the street should be no larger than required for readability from the street taking into account the prevalence of vehicular or pedestrian traffic traffic speeds and setback of the sign in most cases letter heights exceeding 15 feet should not be needed for legibility on signs intended to be read by motorists in the street lettering too small to be safely readable at prevailing traffic speeds should be avoided use of no more than two sizes of lettering excluding lettering on changeable copy areas is preferred 5 fonts type faces or styles use of no more than two type fonts on a sign is preferred the number of fonts used for tenant wall signs in multitenant properties like shopping centers should not be excessive and such signs should share a common base line use of simpler fonts or highly legible versions of stylized fonts is preferable for readability for longer words and messages upperand lower case letters are more readable than all uppercase 6 message since motorists have only seconds to absorb and react to a signs message the number of words and symbols should be kept to a minimum on signs designed to be read by motorists in the street symbols can sometimes be used as substitutes for words the sign should not appear busy cluttered or crowded signs intended to be read primarily by pedestrians or motorists in stopped or slowlymoving vehicles may have more extensive messages the sign should be oriented around a single dominant symbol word or unified combination of symbols andor words with all other elements clearly subordinate 7 blank space the sign should contain sufficient blank space around the copy for legibility 8 supports poles or other bases for ground signs should be part of the overall sign design they should be ornamental in nature to complement the sign face and of a material such as brick stone wood or ironwork or color and of proportions that enhance the sign face supporting structures for projecting signs should be ornamental other planning and improvements standards 124001 general regulations a types of

arterial streets should have straight alignments designed to move large volumes of traffic at high speeds 3 parking no onstreet parking should normally be allowed on arterial streets on street parking on major streets represents the most costly location for parking reduces the capacity of the street diminishes visibility for cars entering the arterial and causes accidents onstreet parking may be allowed as an interim measure until adequate off street parking can be provided it may also be allowed during nonpeak hours if the arterials maximum capacity is not needed then 4 other standards arterial streets and freeways shall conform to the provisions of tables 1240a 1240b and 1240c c collector streets 1 provision in new developments new developments shall provide access from minor streets to arterial streets by incorporating new or extensions of existing collector streets unless the development abuts an existing collector or the planning commission otherwise determines that a collector street is not needed for proper traffic flow 2 continuity collector streets should be continuous between minor streets and arterials they should not offer straight continuous passage from one arterial to another and so encourage traffic to use collectors as bypasses collectors on opposite sides of an arterial should not be continuous across the arterial so as to encourage 3 design particularly in residential areas collectors should be designed as loops or with circuitous alignments or with other features to discourage their use as arterial bypasses 4 singlefamily driveway access single and twofamily dwellings in new developments should avoid having driveways onto collector streets 5 parking onstreet parking may be permitted but should be avoided where possible on collector streets 6 stubs stubs should be provided for collector streets in new developments adjacent to undeveloped land planned for a similar land use so that collectors may be continuous developments where there is a danger of traffic from businesses using residential collectors stubs should not be provided and collectors should be complete within the development 7 serve activity centers collector streets in residential areas should be routed to serve activity centers such as schools churches and shopping areas 8 other standards collector streets shall conform to the provisions of tables 1240a 1240b and 1240c d minor streets and alleys 1 continuity minor streets should not be continuous for extended distances and should be designed to carry traffic from a limited number of lots or building sites to a collector street to discourage speeds over 25 to 30 mph minor streets should intersect frequently with collector and other minor streets particularly in residential areas 2 design minor streets should be designed solely to provide access to the properties they abut and should not be attractive for use in place of collectors or arterials for highspeed nonlocal designs such as narrow pavement widths curved alignments loop streets t intersections eyebrows and culsdesac should be used to this end 3 parking minor streets may provide onstreet parking in lowdensity residential areas or other areas that will not normally require much or any onstreet parking one or both parking lanes may be eliminated 4 spacing spacing of minor streets should be guided by the standards for street jogs in division 124002e7 and maximum block length in table 1240f 5 width minor streets should be no wider than required for reasonable convenience and safety for low volumes of slowmoving traffic and for any parking not provided offstreet especially in residential areas they should be narrow enough to discourage high traffic speeds 6 stubs because they constrain the design of abutting tracts and may remain as stubs permanently no stubs of minor streets should be planned in any development except one that is a phase of a larger development for which a preliminary plat or site plan has been approved 7 depth of loop streets to avoid backtracking movements loop streets should not be deeper than 700 feet 8 alleys alleys may be provided in both

the standards of tables 1240a 1240b 1240c and 1240d e intersections 1 multileg intersections intersections with more than four legssuch as can be created by diagonal streetsshould be avoided especially on arterial streets 2 angle of intersection intersections should be at right angles or as close as possible thereto streets shall not intersect at angles of less than 70 degrees or more than 110 degrees streets shall remain in the angle of intersection for at least 100 feet beyond the point of intersection of street pavements 3 classification of intersecting streets to enhance safety and facilitate traffic movement arterials should be intersected only by freeways other arterials collectors and frontage or marginal access roads minor streets other than frontage and marginal access roads should intersect only other minor streets and collectors culsdesac should not intersect other culsdesac but should intersect only relatively continuous minor or collector streets alleys shall not intersect arterial streets 4 t intersections threeway or t intersections between two minor streets and between minor streets and collectors should be used when possible in lieu of cross or four way intersections because of their greater efficiency and safety 5 spacing distance between intersections on arterial streets should not be less than 1000 feet to avoid conflicts and allow for future grade separation intersections on all streets should where possible be at least 150 feet from an atgrade intersection with a railroad 6 intersection rightofway lines street rightofway lines at intersections shall be a rounded with a minimum radius as follows  alleys 20 feet culsdesac 25 feet other minor streets 25 feet collector streets 25 feet arterial streets 30 feet  b cut off by a

to provide special controls on satellite dish antennas not applicable to other antennas or to accessory uses generally because of the following special characteristics of dish antennas 1 dish antennas are bulkier and more opaque than other antennas and than many other accessory uses giving them greater potential to block views impair security hinder utility or emergency access pose safety hazards in high wind conditions and accumulate weeds and debris underneath 2 dish antennas can appeal to children as play areas in ways not characteristic of other antennas or accessory uses 3 experience in other communities suggests that dish antennas tend to be more visually objectionable to neighbors than other antennas and many other accessory uses the regulations in this section are intended to mitigate these problems while also freely allowing satellite communication and permitting city residents and businesses a free choice between cable and satellite television services b location 1

amendments to these regulations b approval process the process for approval shall be as provided in map amendments rezonings shall conform to the approval criteria of table 1310a table 1310a approval criteria for zoning map amendments 1 support for classification a compatible with environs the uses permitted under the proposed district are compatible with existing uses or zoning in the environs or b supported by trend of development the trend of development redevelopment or land use change in the general area since the original zoning was established supports the proposed zoning classification or c consistent with city plans the proposed classification is in harmony with objectives of the barberton comprehensive plan and other applicable city plans adopted by city council as viewed in light of any changed conditions since adoption 2 furthers public interest the proposed zoning classification promotes the public interest and not solely the interest of the applicant 3 public services available adequate street capacity and public services are anticipated to be available to support the proposed classification c rezonings to po district 1 purpose barberton has a unique history as a planned industrial community and experimental farm created by an imaginative entrepreneur as a result certain properties and areas in the city possess special character deriving from the presence of historic buildings or sites when this character is of sufficient cultural aesthetic or economic value special controls and review procedures governing design of new construction and alterations to existing properties are warranted to further the public welfare the po preservation overlay district as provided herein is intended to establish such controls and procedures without significantly interfering with the development rights conferred by other city regulations it is therefore the intent of this chapter to establish procedures to guide change in historic areas it seeks to do so by encouraging property owners and the city government to work out a mutually acceptable balance between preservation and alteration between aesthetic and nonaesthetic development factors and between the rights of the property owner and the public good specifically the po district is intended to afford special protection to historic properties and areas that will a protect and enhance business cultural and living environments b stimulate appropriate investment in and improvement of historic properties and areas by assuring a controlled environment that encourages such improvement and helps preserve its value c promote business and economic development by preserving the character of buildings and areas that have a special environment that appeals to residents and visitors d preserve the existing character and property values of historically significant parts of barberton by discouraging incompatible change e recognize the rights and needs of property owners and businesses and f promote a balance between aesthetic considerations and economic requirements and between conservation and change the intent of po zoning is to provide a mechanism for negotiations between the public and private sectors that allows the city to make progress while preserving the best of its past 2 approval process rezonings to the po district shall be in conformance with approval criteria of table 1310b and other provisions of this section all proposals for rezoning to the po district shall be accompanied by documentation of conformance to the approval criteria of table 1310b and shall clearly identify all primary property and all secondary property 3 use of po zoning because historic character may be confined to a single property or portion thereof a single lot or building site or portion thereof such as a sign may be classified in the po district if consistent with criterion 3 of table 1310b a po classification of a portion of a lot or building site shall be accompanied by a notation on the zoning district map or addendum thereto indicating what portion of the property is governed by the designation an open site without a building may be classified in the po district if the site is of historic significance or otherwise conforms to the approval criteria of table 1310b 4 secondary property a po district may include secondary property as defined herein whether developed or vacant if city council finds that their control under these provisions is necessary for the protection of primary property in its vicinty no more than 33 percent of the land area excluding streets within a contiguous multilot area located in the po district shall be secondary property except that in order to provide a protected buffer zone around significant properties lots located wholly or partially within 50 feet of a lot on which a primary property is located shall not be counted in determining the percent of land in secondary property 5 moratorium the city council may establish a moratorium on building permits demolition permits andor sign permits in any area for which a rezoning to the po district has been scheduled for consideration no such permit shall be issued for any property within such area unless a final action has been taken by council on such rezoning or 60 days have passed since the beginning of the moratorium whichever comes first or b the permit application has been voluntarily submitted for the review required for a certificate of appropriateness and such certificate has been approved therefor if the rezoning is approved permits shall thereafter be issued only after approval of a certificate of appropriateness 6 design guidelines a guidelines mandatory the design review board shall prepare and recommend for adoption as amendments to this design guidelines for 1 any existing or proposed po district with more than 5 lots and 2 multilot districts of 5 or fewer lots that are adjacent or separated at any point by under 200 feet which are considered a single district for purposes of this provision such guidelines shall conform to the requirements of division b herein no rezoning to the po district shall be effective prior to adoption of such guidelines by city council po districts of more than 5 lots that were preservation districts under previous regulations shall automatically become void if guidelines therefor have not been adopted within 120 days of the date of effect of 131002c b standards for guidelines all design guidelines shall conform to the requirements of this division a set of uniform or model design criteria not related to the specific character of the pozoned area such as the secretary of the interiors stan dards shall not qualify as guidelines hereunder although guidelines may in clude provisions from such criteria 1 findings on existing character guidelines shall be based on surveys and specific findings concerning the visual qualities of the existing historic character of the particular district these findings shall be documented in the guidelines 2 define compatibility guidelines shall serve to clearly define the specific nature of the visual compatibility required of alterations under table 1310j as related to that existing character 3 advance notice to applicants guidelines shall be sufficiently clear and detailed to convey in advance to prospective applicants as specifically as possible what the design review board requires so as to prevent unnecessary delays in approval and unnecessary revisions to alteration plans 4 period of significance guidelines for a multiproperty po district shall identify the period of significance represented by the district such period shall be sufficiently inclusive to acknowledge the span of time during which district properties were constructed or achieved significance the period of significance shall be used as a point of reference for determining visual compatibility within the district it shall not be used to prevent contemporary treatments that may be deemed appropriate within the con text of the district as a whole 5 guidelines for secondary property guidelines shall be defined for secondary property as defined herein that are appropriately less stringent than those applying to primary property 6 costbenefit guidelines shall weigh the benefit to the public of the most historically appropriate treatments against any additional cost to the property owner therefor they shall favor treatments offering the greatest public benefit in relation to private cost 7 removal of po zoning the city shall rezone a property area or portion thereof to remove the po district if the characteristics of the property area or portion thereof on which the po zoning was based have permanently ceased to exist such rezoning shall not require a request therefor from the owner of the affected property if a valid request is received the rezoning shall be adopted by city council no later than 90 days after receipt by the planning director of the request 8 property maintenance the building commissioner shall give priority in enforcement of the citys property maintenance regulations to primary properties located in the po district especially those with the most significant violations in order to prevent deterioration that would justify or require demolition this requirement shall not apply to secondary properties if the property owner has not performed maintenance work ordered by the commissioner within a reasonable period as determined by the commissioner the commissioner may arrange for such work to be performed and assess the property owner for the cost thereof 9 mandatory referral actions by city government relating to properties in the po district are subject to mandatory referral as provided in 131009 10 sunset provision all provisions for the po preservation overlay district shall become null and void if a either prior to or within 360 days after the date of effect of division 131002c the design review board has not recommended to city council the rezoning of private property to such district or to the predecessor preservation district or b either prior to or within 540 days after such date city council has not approved any such rezoning 131002 amendments table 1310b approval criteria for rezoning to po district 1 significance the property or area to be rezoned has at least one of the significances specified below a historic significance it has special value associated with a site person group organization event or pattern of events of local state or national historic significance for this purpose a pattern of events shall be considered a series of discrete events that are related both to each other and to the significance of the property or area and that do not serve merely to identify a historical era or other period of time or a style of architecture b architectural significance it has special value as historic architecture by 1 being the work of a historically notable builder architect or designer or 2 embodying architectural elements that make it innovative distinctive excellent uncommon irreplaceable or otherwise significant or 3 serving to create a special character or atmosphere that is of an economic value to the city or a portion thereof that justifies its preservation c other significance it has special value resulting from a singular physical characteristic that is a widely recognized and widely esteemed visual feature or landmark of the city or of any neighborhood special value shall be considered to mean value not commonly exhibited by other properties or areas in the city such value need not be oneofakind but shall be sufficiently uncommon to clearly merit special regulatory protection the property or area has further not seen publicly visible alterations to the original design or to a successor design established as the compatibility standard that are so drastic as to have largely destroyed the significance of the area or property and that could be reversed only with extraordinary difficulty 2 suitability for preservation the property or area exhibits sound structural condition and remains largely suitable physically for preservation or restoration 3 consistent with adjacent property or plan the placement of the property or area in the po district is consistent with the significance of adjacent property or with the preservation plan for the city it therefore does not represent an arbitrary imposition only upon certain properties or areas with such significance note this table defines criteria for primary property as defined herein individual properties not meeting these criteria may be included in a multi property district as secondary property subject to the provisions of 131002 c a variances 1 purpose and applicability because of special circumstances affecting particular properties in the city the literal application of the provisions of this in certain instances create unintended hardships or practical difficulties as provided in table 1320a the board of zoning and building appeals and planning commission may accordingly grant variances from the literal application of any provision of this or any provision of a site plan approved under based on findings of fact related to the approval criteria of table 1310c 2 approval process the variance approval process shall be as provided in 3 use variances no variance shall be approved or conditionally approved the effect of which would be substantially equivalent to a rezoning or conditional use approval or that would otherwise permit any use not allowed as a permitted or conditional use in the applicable district 4 nonvariance relief if the board of zoning and building appeals or planning commission finds that a requested variance fails to conform to the applicable approval criteria and that a text or map amendment or other development approval is necessary to grant an applicant relief it shall so advise the applicant a subsequent application for such other approval shall not be considered a rehearing under division 132002g18 5 variances and bonuses no variance shall be approved if a zoning bonus is providedsuch as by table 1230i or division 111002f5that would achieve the same result unless the board of zoning and building appeals or planning commission finds use of the bonus to be impractical in the particular case 6 homeowner variances a purpose the purpose of homeowner variance procedures is to reduce the time and expense to homeowners of obtaining approval of simple variances that are likely to have minimal adverse impact b eligibility the fee owner contract purchaser or option holder of a singlefamily detached or attached or townhouse dwelling or a twoor threefamily dwelling who wishes to request a variance for that dwelling or its lot may apply for a homeowner variance an application involving more than one dwelling or more than one lot as defined herein shall not be filed as a homeowner variance c benefits 1 reduced submissions filing submissions for homeowner variances shall be determined on a case bycase basis by the building commissioner and may be less than required for other variances in table 1320b 2 lower filing fees the city council may establish fees for homeowner variances that are lower than those for other variances other procedures and requirements shall be as provided for all variances 131003 adjustments b conditional uses and special exceptions 1 purpose certain uses cannot be allowable generally in a particular zoning district or in any zoning district because of the impact their special character creates on surrounding areas some such uses may however be properly allowed under special conditions these uses may be approved as conditional uses if specifically designated as such in the applicable zoning district 2 applicability because a conditional use is compatible only under special conditions no certificate of compliance shall be issued for any use authorized as a conditional use in the applicable district before approval of a conditional use permit except as specifically provided otherwise herein all regulations of the applicable zoning district and all other applicable city regulations shall apply to conditional uses 3 approval process the process for approval of conditional uses shall be as provided in approval criteria shall be as provided in table 1310d 4 review factors in evaluating the suitability of a conditional use the planning commission shall examine as applicable the following characteristics of the use and its structures or components a location and orientation b lot size c size of facility including floor area structure height design capacity and anticipated employment d site design and arrangement e provisions affecting on and offsite pedestrian and traffic movement vehicle storage and access by emergency vehicles f appearance g screening or landscaping h onor offsite buffering from incompatible uses with open spaces or transitional uses i operations factors such as hours of use or environmental controls that affect land use compatibility j other characteristics of the proposed use pertinent in the judgment of the commission to an assessment of the impact of the use on the area 5 specific standards the commission may call upon technical experts to determine specific development standards for particular conditional uses or other special exceptions 6 other special exceptions like conditional uses other special exceptions to provisions of city development regulations may be approved without the need for an amendment or variance when such exceptions and the conditions under which they may be allowed are specifically authorized in this exceptions may be approved conditionally approved or disapproved the process for their approval shall be as provided in approval criteria shall be as specified for the particular exception table 1310c approval criteria for variances 1 special circumstances not found elsewhere special circumstances fully described in findings of fact exist that are peculiar to the property for which the variance is sought and that do not apply generally to other properties in the same district or other regulatory classification and these circumstances are not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make it reasonably practical to provide in the form of a text amendment to the applicable regulations a general regulation to cover them 2 hardship or practical difficulties for reasons fully set forth in the written findings the literal application of the applicable provision would result in unnecessary and undue hardship or practical difficulties for the applicant as distinguished from mere inconvenience 3 not resulting from applicant action the special circumstances and practical difficulties or hardship that are the basis for the variance have not resulted from any act of the applicant or of any other party with a present interest in the property undertaken subsequent to the adoption of the regulation being varied knowingly authorizing or proceeding with any action requiring any variance permit certificate or approval under city development regulations prior to such approval shall be considered such an act and shall not be the basis for approval of a variance 4 preserves rights conferred by district a variance is necessary for the applicant to enjoy a substantial property right possessed by other conforming properties in the same district or other regulatory classification and does not confer a special privilege ordinarily denied to such other properties 5 necessary for use of property the grant of a variance is necessary not because it will increase the applicants economic return although it may have this effect but because without a variance the applicant will be deprived of reasonable use or enjoyment of or reasonable return as defined herein from the property 6 not alter local character the granting of the variance will not alter the essential character of the locality nor substantially impair environmental quality property values or public safety or welfare in the vicinity 7 consistent with plan the granting of a variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the regulations of this of the barberton comprehensive plan and other applicable adopted plans of the city as viewed in light of any changed conditions since their adoption it will not serve in effect to substantially invalidate or nullify any part thereof 8 minimum variance needed the variance approved is the minimum required to provide the applicant with relief from undue hardship or practical difficulties and with reasonable use and enjoyment of his or her property please note to view the variances graphic see 7 of the printed version of the barberton development c appeals 1 purpose because actions of administrative officials and bodies under city regulations are subject to occasional error the board of zoning and building appeals may hear appeals of such actions and modify them if it finds an error has been made 2 applicability except as otherwise provided herein any party including the city itself tht is aggrieved by an alleged error in an administrative actionsuch as an order requirement decision or determinationmade under this the building commissioner planning director or other authorized administrative official board commission or department of the city may file an appeal thereof with the board of zoning and building

action was based f a brief summary of the factual evidence upon which the appeal is based g a plot plan and verbal description of the use affected by the action being appealed b stay of proceedings the filing of a notice of appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed unless the building commissioner certifies to the board of zoning and building appeals that in his or her judgment a stay would cause imminent peril to life health or property in such case no proceedings shall be stayed without issuance of a restraining order by the board or a court of record c action by board the building commissioner shall transmit to the board upon receipt the notice of appeal and the complete record of the decision appealed the board shall set a reasonable time for a meeting to

or reverse the action appealed subject only to judicial review to this end the board shall have all the powers of the party whose action was appealed including the power to direct the issuance of a certificate or permit table 1310d approval criteria for conditional uses on the basis of the review factors cited under in division 131003b4 or changes in such factors required as a condition to approval the proposed use will be compatible with its environs in all of the ways indicated herein 1 neighborhood character the proposed use will fit harmoniously with the character of existing permitted uses in its environs any adverse effects on environmental quality property values or neighborhood character beyond those normally associated with permitted uses in the district have been minimized 2 environmental nuisance any effects of noise glare odor dust waste disposal blockage of light or air or other adverse environmental effects of a type or degree not characteristic of permitted uses in the district have been minimized 3 traffic any adverse impact of types or volumes of traffic flow not otherwise typical of permitted uses in the zoning district has been minimized 4 use of public services and facilities the proposed use will not require existing community facilities or services to a degree disproportionate to that normally expected of permitted uses in the district nor generate disproportionate demand for new services or facilities in such a way as to place undue burdens upon existing development in the area 5 statutory public functions disapproval or conditional approval of a conditional use requested by a public body will not generally prevent such body from discharging its statutory functions but will only place reasonable restrictions on how and where those functions may be performed 6 other factors the use is in harmony with any other elements of compatibility pertinent to the conditional use in its proposed location d changes to properties with nonconformities 1 purpose in an older city like barberton in which much development preceded modern land use regulations certain determinations of the extent to which nonconformities with current regulations should be eliminated can more equitably be made on the basis of casebycase review than by an inflexible general rule 2 applicability when any of the actions specified in table 1340a of nonconformities requires a decision by the board of zoning and building appeals on required elimination of nonconformities the owner of the affected property shall file an application with the board 3 approval process the process for approval of changes to properties with nonconformities shall be as provided in approval criteria shall be as provided in table 1310f 4 action by board the board may require that all nonconformities be completely eliminated that some nonconformities be completely or partially eliminated or that no nonconformities be reduced or eliminated the board may make its approval of a proposed action subject to such conditions as it deems necessary table 1310e approval criteria for appeals the board shall sustain an appeal and reverse or modify an action appealed only if it finds that the action was an error not in conformance with applicable regulations of this virtue of being 1 based on erroneous interpretation of those regulations or 2 based on an erroneous finding of a fact material to the action taken under the regulations or 3 an abuse of the discretion allowed under the regulations or 4 clearly not in conformance with applicable approval criteria or other provisions of the regulations if the board finds that the action appealed was undertaken in full compliance with applicable regulations it shall sustain the action and deny the appeal even if it finds the action or the regulation to be objectionable the board may recommend to the planning commission or city council that the regulations be amended if it finds certain provisions to be undesirable but it shall not sustain an appeal as an alternative to such amendment table 1310f approval criteria for changes to properties with nonconformities a nonconformity on a nonconforming property shall be eliminated or reduced to the extent the board of zoning and building appeals determines reasonable the board shall base its determination on such of the factors in this table as may in its judgment apply 1 effect on nonconformity the extent to which the requested action will reduce or increase the extent of nonconformity and make the property more nearly conforming or more nonconforming 2 effect on incompatibility the extent to which the action will otherwise reduce or increase incompatibility with the propertys surroundings as related to the approval criteria for conditional uses in table 1310d 3 prevalence of nonconformity the degree to which the nonconformity is prevalent among properties in the environs and the extent to which its elimination might make the property less rather than more compatible therewith 4 perceptible adverse effects the degree to which the nonconformity is noticeable to the public and produces significant adverse effects on the environment of the area 5 effect on useful life the extent to which the requested action will tend to significantly prolong or reduce the useful physical or economic life of the nonconformity or otherwise delay or accelerate its eventual elimination 6 investment in nonconformity the amount of investment in the nonconformity the normal useful life thereof and the amount of benefit already realized therefrom 7 legal obligations the existence of leases or other legal obligations governing the continuation of the nonconformity and the existence of contingency provisions permitting termination of such obligations 8 physical feasibility the feasibility of eliminating the nonconformity without relocation of sound major structures or acquisition of additional land 9 financial feasibility the feasibility of eliminating the nonconformity without expense disproportionate to the cost of the proposed action 10 parking the impact of the action on the need for offstreet parking and the degree to which it is possible to eliminate any parking nonconformity 11 conformity with plan the extent to which the requested action is supported by the adopted barberton comprehensive plan despite present zoning that may not support it 12 hardship the degree to which requiring elimination of the nonconformity in conjunction with the requested action would impose undue hardship upon the property owner or user because of the inability of the property to be reasonably used without the nonconformity a temporary uses 1 purpose uses not in conformance with the provisions of this provide a public benefit without significant detriment to the public welfare if they are established only for limited durations in such cases full compliance with regulations for permanent uses may be

of zoning district map boundaries in division 111001b1 or c other applicable regulations c unlisted uses similar to listed uses 1 purpose no set of regulations can list all land uses that may exist or may come into existence in the future unnecessary costs and delays are imposed by requiring approval of a text amendment to this to the establishment in a zoning district of an unlisted use that is similar to a use already listed as allowed in that district the provisions of this division allow such uses to be established with minimal cost and delay 2 applicability a use may be determined to be

similar to listed conditional uses shall be subject to the approval of a conditional use permit all regulations applicable to a listed use shall also apply to an unlisted use to which it is judged similar passed 112816 table 1310g approval criteria for temporary uses 1 no permanent exception to normal requirements the temporary use is not likely to create longterm or permanent conditions in conflict with applicable city development regulations governing permanent uses 2 easily terminated the use is of such a nature as to be easily and inexpensively terminated if termination is required or if any condition to which the temporary use permit is made subject is not maintained any permanent structures installed for the temporary use are suitable for conversion to permanent uses allowed under applicable city regulations 3 not alternative to other approval the temporary use permit is the most suitable device to grant a use temporary relief from regulatory requirements and does not serve as an alternative to a variance amendment conditional use or other approval for a use that is likely to remain permanently 4 not alter local character the temporary use will not permanently alter the essential character of the locality nor substantially and permanently impair environmental quality property values or public safety or welfare in the vicinity a purpose the city planning

without literal application of the detailed regulations otherwise applicable and 2 special amenities and benefits to the city beyond those otherwise required by city regulationsand the development of properties with special constraints such as environmental sensitivity or bypassed infill parcelscan be achieved by allowing more flexible planning than is otherwise allowed by such regulations these objectives can be accomplished where 1 a substantial area of land is planned for development as a single integrated unit and 2 its planning is subject to more detailed review by the city than is usually required and 3 its development is governed by a specific plan rather than by generally applicable verbal regulations and quantitative standards the objective of planned unit development pud is therefore not simply to allow exceptions to otherwise applicable regulations it is instead to make possible a higher level of urban environmental quality than can be achieved under the normal development requirements it is accordingly the intent of the city to suspend the application of detailed land use regulations as provided herein only where such special quality is achieved in this way the city may grant the creative developer a desirable flexibility and at the same time not only protect but enhance the welfare of the residents and other users of a development and the rest of the community approval under this section is a privilege to be earned and not a right that can be claimed exceptions to the normal regulations are not granted automatically but only upon a finding that they will result in a superior development provision of amenities such as landscaping open space or recreational features that meet only the minimum requirements of this not be the basis for approval

impact on their environs while others have minimal impact examples of a standards nonconformity are a house with an interior side yard smaller than required by the a business with fewer offstreet parking spaces than the b use nonconformities use nonconformities as defined herein normally have more significant adverse impact on their surroundings than standards nonconformities and use
