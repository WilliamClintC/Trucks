findings the governing body of the municipality finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance and development throughout a watershed increases flooding flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces infiltration and groundwater recharge increases nonpoint source pollution to waterways and threatens public health and safety b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance and development throughout a watershed can harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of stream beds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c a comprehensive program of stormwater management including minimization of impacts of new development redevelopment and other earth disturbance activities causing accelerated runoff and erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety and general welfare of the people of the municipality and all of the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater is an important water resource that provides infiltration and groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by reducing the volume of stormwater generated and by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality infiltration stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems costeffective and environmentally sensitive stormwater management can be achieved use of nonstructural site design techniques that minimize impervious surfaces

protect those uses in all streams and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection streams as required by statewide regulations at 25 pa collectively referred to herein as state water quality requirements  to control postconstruction stormwater impacts from regulated earth disturbance activities state water quality requirements can be met by bmps including site design which provide for replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions so that postconstruction stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical chemical or biological characteristics of the receiving waters as described in the dep comprehensive stormwater management policy #3920300002  this may be achieved by the following a infiltration replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration conditions  b treatment use of water quality treatment bmps to ensure filtering out of chemical and physical pollutants from the stormwater runoff  and c streambank and streambed protection management of volume and rate of postconstruction stormwater discharges to prevent physical degradation of receiving waters eg from scouring and erosion  the dep has regulations that require municipalities to ensure design implementation and maintenance of best management practices bmps that control runoff from new development and redevelopment hereinafter development after regulated earth disturbance activities are complete these requirements include the need to implement postconstruction stormwater bmps with assurance of longterm operations and maintenance of those bmps  evidence of any necessary permits for regulated earth disturbance activities from the appropriate dep regional office or county conservation district must be provided to the city an npdes
