problems creating nuisances impairing other beneficial uses of environmental resources and hindering the ability of the city to provide adequate water sewage flood control and other community services in addition extraordinary public expenditures may be required for the protection of persons and property in such areas and in areas which may be affected by unplanned land usage  32393 purpose the purpose of this article is to promote preserve and enhance the natural resources within the city and protect them from adverse effects occasioned by poorly sited development or incompatible activities by regulating land disturbing or development activities that would have an adverse and potentially irreversible impact on water quality and unique and fragile environmentally sensitive land  by minimizing conflicts and encouraging compatibility between land disturbing and development activities and water quality and environmentally sensitive lands  and by requiring detailed review standards and procedures for land disturbing or development activities proposed for such areas thereby achieving a balance between urban growth and development and protection of water quality and natural areas
