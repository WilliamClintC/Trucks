substantial improvements to existing residential structures for human habitation may be authorized by variance in accordance with the provisions of this section all variances applications shall be considered by the board of adjustment and shall be made on the variance application form provided by the floodplain administrator a nature of variance a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this floodplain regulations would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners the variance provisions however are established with the understanding that protection from flood hazards is the compelling objective and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or other requirements in the flood ordinance are deemed to be rare therefore the variance provisions in this section are intentionally very detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly authorized the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b factors to be considered by the board of adjustment in acting upon requests for variances the board of adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors and standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the following 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing owner or occupants and future owners or occupants of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the general plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges c conditions for granting of a variance by board of adjustment the following conditions shall govern granting of variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures and provisions for flood hazard reduction in this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this ordinance 4 variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance or cause fraud or victimization of the public or conflict with other existing town regulations 5 upon consideration of the factors of the purposes of this chapter the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of and preserve the integrity of this chapter d notice of action on variance any applicant to whom a variance has been granted shall be given written notice by the floodplain administrator that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property further a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the san mateo county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land the costs for such notice and recording of the notice shall be paid by the applicant to whom the variance has been granted e variance terms defined in addition to the other definitions contained in this chapter the following words and their meanings pertain to the foregoing variance provisions 1 fraud and victimization means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public in examining this requirement the board of adjustment will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during such periods of time to increased risk of damage from floods while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs inconvenience danger and suffering that those increased potential for flood damages may bring in addition future owners may purchase the property unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates 2 hardship means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance to grant a variance the board of adjustment must determine that the variance is exceptional unusual and peculiar to the property involved mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional inconvenience aesthetic considerations physical handicaps or personal preferences likewise cannot as a rule quality as an exceptional hardship all of these problems can be resolved means without granting a variance even if the alternative is more expensive or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended 3 public safety and nuisance means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood or any considerable number of persons  2005   development permit review action on permit notification of other agencies certification and maintenance of records map determinations remedial actions the floodplain administrator shall review all development permits to determine that required conditions of this chapter have been satisfied all other required state and federal permits have been obtained the site is reasonably safe from flooding and the proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated for purposes of this chapter adversely affects means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point a notification of other agencies for any alteration or relocation of a watercourse the floodplain administrator shall notify adjacent communities and the california department of water resources prior to alteration or relocation and shall submit evidence of such notification to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency the notification shall including data assuring that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained b documentation of floodplain development the floodplain administrator shall obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed all certifications required by this

special building setbacks along earthquake faults a purpose special building setbacks are established along earthquake fault traces to minimize the potential loss of property and life resulting from differential movement along such traces caused by tectonic forces b maps the town geologic map and ground movement potential map adopted by resolution 2279200 as amended from time to time provides the basis for required fault setbacks two types of setbacks are established one type is for setbacks along the san andreas fault the other type is for setbacks from fault other than the san andreas c setbacks from the san andreas fault the town ground movement potential map establishes required building setbacks along the active traces of the san andreas fault the san andreas fault is a known hazard for development and it is prudent to preclude construction of buildings for human occupancy within these zones 1 delineation of earthquake fault zones earthquake fault zones define the areas along faults in which primary fault rupture may occur the map ground movement potential adopted pursuant to town council resolution 2279200 as amended defines the boundaries of the fault zones and labels them pf where the location of the fault is known and the pattern of ground breakage is parallel to the direction of the trace the trace is classified as a known trace and shown in a solid line where the location of the trace is less well known and the pattern of expected ground breakage is parallel to the direction of the trace the trace is classified as an inferred trace and is shown in a dashed line where the pattern of ground breakage results in an enechelon pattern the trace is identified on the map as an enechelon trace and shown as a series of short lines at an angle to the general alignment of the trace an enechelon trace consists of relatively short ruptures on the order of forty feet in length oriented obliquely to the general fault trend 2 required setbacks for buildings for human occupancy the boundaries of the pf zones constitute the required building setback lines for buildings for human occupancy setbacks are based on the following measurements taken at a right angle from the fault trace where the location of the trace is known the boundary of the zone is set back from the trace fifty feet from the center line of the trace where the location of the trace is inferred the boundary of the zone is set back one hundred feet from the center line of the trace where the trace is characterized as an enechelon trace the boundary of the zone is set back one hundred feet from the center line of the trace 3 buildings not intended for human occupancy the following buildings not intended for human occupancy are allowed within fault setbacks a buildings that do not exceed one hundred twenty square feet and are used as a tool shed an ornamental garden structure an animal shade structure an agricultural building or for a similar nature and use b other nonhabitable buildings not exceeding a floor area of one hundred twenty square feet and are of a similar nature and use may be permitted by staff or by the planning commission upon referral by staff d setbacks from faults other than the san andreas the town ground movement potential map shows traces noted as fault other than the san andreas while the location and future movement of these faults is less certain than for the san andreas fault it is still prudent to make certain that buildings for human occupancy do not cross such faults 1 construction of new buildings for human occupancy within one hundred feet of such mapped fault traces shall be supported by a sitespecific geologic investigation that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the town geologist that the structure is not underlain by the suspected fault this investigation must include recommendations for specific geotechnical measures including appropriate seismic design criteria and minimum setback requirements to mitigate potential adverse impact from the mapped fault trace and the estimated potential for some degree of displacement along the fault trace alignment 2 construction of new buildings not for human occupancy shall comply with required front side and rear setbacks e modification of requirements when geologic studies acceptable to the planning commission demonstrate that delineations of the san andreas fault setback zones or the location of faults other than the san andreas are incorrect the planning commission may approve modifications to the geologic map andor the ground movement potential map

chapter 1859  creek setbacks purposes of creek setbacks a the overall purpose of this chapter is to improve the quality of creek bank protection measures used on town creeks discourage practices that pose a risk to property improvements and neighboring properties and protect the unique scenic qualities and habitat values of the creek environment that sustain wildlife by furnishing habitation freshwater and migration corridors it is envisioned that this chapter will benefit creekside property owners residents of the town and region and the overall environmental quality of the creeks and adjacent habitats the measures are intended to help ensure that over time changes within creek setbacks will help restore the creeks and creeksides to a healthy natural environment b the specific purposes of the setbacks are 1 to keep new buildings out of range of potential creekbank failure and flooding 2 to provide for the review of modifications or replacements of existing structures and impervious surface areas within creek setbacks in order to prevent further encroachment and to encourage decreasing existing encroachments when modifications or replacements take place 3 to restrict new structures in creek setbacks to those deemed necessary for creekbank stabilization projects utility crossings roads and driveways 4 to retain adequate space adjacent to creek banks for access and work space to replace failing bank protections  to remove obstructions that pose a risk of flooding  and to facilitate bank protection projects utilizing stateofthe art practices such as grading to achieve more stable bank angles and biotechnical or bioengineered designs 5 to retain adequate space adjacent to creekbanks to allow wildlife movement and migration 6 to protect creekside vegetation that stabilizes the soil and reduces flow velocities erosion sedimentation and creekbank failure 7 to protect creekside vegetation as wildlife habitat for those species song birds waterfowl mammals reptiles fish amphibians dependent on creeks and their flanking native vegetation 8 to protect water quality and creekside vegetation for shading and cooling of creek water to provide an environment supportive of trout other fish amphibians and invertebrates 9 to implement the policies of the general plan that designate creek corridors as sensitive areas providing important aquatic and terrestrial wildlife habitat and that require all new subdivisions and site development proposals to contain setback areas sufficient to buffer wildlife inhabiting the creek corridor from the impact of development  2007   creeks subject to creek setback provisions the following creeks are subject to the creek setback provisions in this chapter los trancos creek corte madera creek and sausal creek

unit developments setbacks may be modified by the planning commission to achieve better consistency with the purposes of this chapter as part of the planned unit development process to increase safety as well as protect the natural environment c for new subdivisions parcels shall have a minimum creek setback of fiftyfive feet from the top of creek bank but this setback may be required to be enlarged as part of the subdivision process to increase safety as well as protect the natural environment sensitive habitats floodplains and eroding creek banks should be included within the setback

buildings decks driveways impervious surfaces and other structures that are within a required creek setback may be reconstructed or replaced as provided for in items a and b below provided that in no case shall such construction increase the extent of the encroachment into the setback area the extent of encroachment takes into account both the total square footage of structures within the setback and their proximity to the creek since flexibility in design is desirable for property owners and provides opportunities to reduce impacts on the creek new construction is not limited to the footprint or location of the preexisting structure but may be relocated in order to provide a design more consistent with the purposes of such relocations cannot however increase the extent of encroachment in the setback the building permit andor a site development permit may require measures that are reasonably related to the project in order to prevent creek bank failure and erosion and to mitigate adverse effects on the creek environment property owners are encouraged to decrease existing encroachments in creek setbacks when construction or replacement takes place a reconstruction and replacement following involuntary damage existing buildings decks driveways impervious surfaces and other structures that are within a required creek setback may be reconstructed or replaced when necessitated by involuntary damage for purposes of this chapter involuntary damage is defined as damage by fire flood explosion wind earthquake war riot or wood destroying pests or other calamity or

style of architecture selected d the relationship of a structure to its surroundings is of greater importance than the quality of design of the individual structure e nonresidential structures shall
