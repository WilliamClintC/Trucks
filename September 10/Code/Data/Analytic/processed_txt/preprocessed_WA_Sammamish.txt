designee shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal insurance administration upon request 2conditions for variances agenerally the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level  provided that subsections 1di xi of this section have been fully considered as the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases bvariances may be issued for the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set forth in this section cvariances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result dvariances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief evariances shall only be issued upon ia showing of good and sufficient cause  iia determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and iiia determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances fvariances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants or economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare gvariances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dryfloodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria except subsection 2a of this section and otherwise complies with smc 1 and 2 hany applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor

purpose of this chapter is to preserve the aesthetic character of the town center planning area to improve the aesthetic and functional quality of the built environment to promote retention and protection of existing vegetation  to promote water efficiency to provide a drainage function to manage hydrology closest to the source to reduce the impacts of development on drainage systems and natural habitats to increase privacy for residential zones and to promote native wildlife the desired result of landscaping and site design standards is that the town center exhibit a predominantly natural landscape character emphasizing mature plants and informal naturalistic layout within this naturalistic backdrop there may be areas of more formal urban character where the type and intensity of uses or the desire for a more gardenlike setting are appropriate another goal of the landscape concept is to improve ecological functions such as surface water retention temperature reduction and

requirements 1intent it is the citys intent that surface parking in the town center be minimized in order to areduce the amount of land occupied by parking  breduce negative impacts to visual quality and pedestrian access  and creduce costs and impacts associated with surface water runoff facilities to that end the city will encourage appropriate reductions in parking requirements and take steps to provide transportation to and within the town center that reduce automobile trips and subsequent need for parking at the same time the city shall encourage that structured parking be constructed in lieu of surface parking accessory to a development structured parking is pursued not only to reduce the surface parking footprint but also as a means to reduce the cost and impacts of stormwater treatment facilities roofs and water collection and reuse provide the potential for electric plugin parking and to take advantage of sloped topography on many sites the longterm goal is that 80 percent of parking for offstreet residential and commercial uses be structured reflecting the envisioned compact and intensive but smaller scale land uses in the town center the city recognizes that achieving this goal will require a strategic incremental approach over time to avoid shortterm disincentives to development in addition to the requirements in subsection 2 of this section the city may consider partnering with private entities to create a system of parking garages located strategically throughout the mixeduse zones in the town center appropriate actions may include providing grant funds public financing mechanisms and planning and design services and coordinating various parties in public parking projects 2at least 80 percent of all required offstreet parking for residential uses except for cottage housing and for commercial uses or development requiring more than 90 offstreet stalls shall be structured either above at or below grade as opposed to surface parking on pavement at grade without other uses constructed above the parking level the city may waive or reduce this requirement for one or more of the following conditions athe proponent can demonstrate to the directors satisfaction that such a parking structure prevents the project from being economically feasible as defined in smc to do that the proponent must show pro forma that the costs associated with parking increase overall project costs above that which can be supported by market rate rents or sales bthe parking configuration is such that it can be converted into structured parking at a later date to provide additional parking for development the city may require that the proponent agree to make the land on which the parking is situated available to the city for garage construction under mutually agreeable terms cthe parcel configuration or dimensions do not allow structured parking dthere is an agreement with the city that the proponent will construct structured parking to accommodate any subsequent development or redevelopment the proponent must show how this will be achieved within a specified time frame eother conditions deemed acceptable to the city that are

encourage housing affordable to all economic groups and to meet its regional share of affordable housing requirements the purpose of this section is to 1 implement the responsibility of the city under state law to provide for housing opportunities for all economic segments of the community 2 help address the shortage of housing in the city for persons of low and moderateincome 3 preserve land for affordable housing as the city continues to grow 4 promote development of housing that would not otherwise be built in the city 5 create affordable housing opportunities as a result of increased development capacity in the town center planning area 6 offer additional incentives to encourage construction of affordable housing units in town center  and 7 encourage developments that include affordable housing and that combine local incentives provided by the city with resources available from other public and private sources att a 21b basic density provisions 1baseline affordable housing in any residential development eg multiplefamily developments rental or ownership singlefamily subdivisions mixeduse developments not less than 10 percent of the allocated residential density dwelling units pursuant to smc 21b must be affordable housing units the affordable housing units will have occupancy requirements and affordability levels as defined in smc 21b for any site this requirement applies to the residential units provided up to the base number of allowed units no additional residential or commercial density beyond the base number of allowed units will be provided to meet this 10 percent affordable unit requirement those projects providing additional affordable units may receive additional density as provided in subsection 3 of this section residential bonus unitsadditional affordable housing and as provided for in smc 21b note that in some cases applicants may receive additional residential unit allocations based on tdr purchases andor site amenities this program is intended to increase the actual supply of affordable housing so the primary objective is to obtain housing units within the development in preference to an alternative approach except as otherwise provided for in smc 21b 2affordable housing units and allocated residential density required affordable housing units pursuant to subsection 1 of this section shall be counted as onehalf a dwelling unit for the purpose of calculating allocated residential density pursuant to smc 21b for example a residential development that requires six affordable housing units would calculate the affordable housing units to be equivalent to three dwelling units for the purpose of calculating allocated residential density pursuant to smc 21b affordable housing units built for the purposes of increasing site density above the allocated residential density shall be counted as one dwelling unit for the purposes of calculating maximum residential density pursuant to smc 21b 3residential bonus unitsadditional affordable housing the town center plan includes the allocation of 344 residential bonus units 427 total units once the discounted affordable housing units are added per subsection 2 of this section specified in smc 21b allocation of residential bonus units is based on the following criteria an individual project can receive three residential bonus units for each affordable housing unit provided above the minimum 10 percent required pursuant to this section the affordable housing units will have occupancy requirements and affordability levels as defined in smc 21b example if a property has a base density of 50 units and an applicant requested nine residential bonus units three of the bonus residential units would have to be affordable units the development would have a total of 59 units of which eight would be affordable units five affordable units of the base 50 units plus three of the nine bonus residential units 4alternative calculation of affordability an applicant may propose alternative affordability levels for the affordable housing units the percentage of required affordable units and the ratio of bonus units or bonus floor area per affordable housing unit for alternative affordability levels will be as follows affordability level percent affordable units for baseline requirement residential bonus units to affordable units ratio 50% of median income 4% 33 to 1 60% of median income 5% 32 to 1 70% of median income 65% 31 to 1 80% of median income 10% 3 to 1 note depending on the level of affordability provided the affordable housing units may not be eligible for the impact fee waivers described in smc title 14a 5rounding for developments with more than 10 residential units the number of required affordable housing units is determined by rounding fractional numbers up to the nearest whole number from onehalf 6minimum threshold for any residential development consisting of less than 10 units the affordability requirements may be satisfied payment to the city of an inlieu fee aamount the inlieu fee to be paid for each affordable dwelling unit shall be determined by the director and shall equal an amount sufficient to create an amount of affordable housing equal to or greater than what would have otherwise been provided if the affordable housing had been provided on site btiming of payment in lieufees shall be paid at the time a building permit is issued for the development calternative to cash at the discretion of the city council or director where a developer is authorized to pay a fee in lieu of development an irrevocable dedication of land or other nonmonetary contribution of a value not less than the sum of the otherwise required inlieu fee may be accepted as an alternative to paying the inlieu fee if it is determined that the nonmonetary contribution will be effectual in furthering the goals and policies of the housing element and this chapter the valuation of any land offered in lieu shall be determined by an mai appraisal made by an agent agreed upon by the city costs associated with the appraisal shall be borne by the developer ddeposit of fees all inlieu fees collected hereunder shall be deposited in a housing trust fund the fund shall be administered by the city and shall be used only for the purpose of providing funding assistance for the provision of

project resources may be redirected to arch housing trust fund att a 21b modifications to dimensional standards the following requirements of the town center development code may be modified to accommodate residential bonus units these modifications may not be used to accommodate the units resulting from the base density 1parking requirement an applicant may request a modification of the minimum required number of parking spaces by providing a study that substantiates parking demand can be met with a reduced parking requirement in a manner consistent with the goals and policies of the applicable regional transportation plan said study shall be prepared by a qualified professional transportation planner or engineer approved by the director 2structure height maximum height for structures containing affordable housing units may be increased by one story in the tca and tcb zones consistent with setback requirements in smc maximum structure height may not be modified provision for any portion of a structure that is adjoining a tcc d or e zone att a 21b alternative compliance 1general the director may approve a request for satisfying all or part of the affordable housing requirements with alternative compliance methods if they meet the following requirements athe project proponent may propose an offsite alternative and must demonstrate that any alternative compliance method achieves a result equal to or better than providing affordable housing on site baffordable housing units provided alternative compliance method must be based on providing the same type of units

specific elements and characteristics the term should is taken to mean is required unless the city determines that there is a compelling reason to the contrary based on the objectives and policies of the adopted town center plan the intent of this language is to allow the city and proponent the flexibility to achieve the town center plans and these principles objectives means than those specified below the uzdp proponent shall be required to demonstrate that the following are met to the citys satisfaction 1pedestrian circulation atown center mixeduse nodes should incorporate a network of pedestrian and bicycle connections including sidewalks trails pathways and open spaces that link all public open spaces commercial businesses residential areas and nearby centerwide or citywide trails  bthe pedestrian and bicycle network should conform to the adopted town center infrastructure plan for the tca1 zone and the intent of the town center open space strategy  parks open spaces and trails concept illustrated in figure 35 and the conceptual sammamish town center street layout figures 32 and 33 of the town center plan although the actual configuration of trails and connections may vary  cthe pedestrian and bicycle network should feature pedestrian amenities and landscaping  and dthe pedestrian and bicycle network must conform to americans with disabilities act ada standards and should incorporate crime prevention design cpted guidelines 2vehicle circulation atown center mixeduse nodes should feature a network of vehicle access roads and drives that conforms to the intent of the town center transportation section and the conceptual sammamish town center street layout figures 32 and 33 of the town center plan although the actual street and vehicular access may vary from those shown in the figures for the tca1 zone the adopted town center infrastructure plan takes precedence over the specific sections and visualizations shown in the town center plan  bthe proponent must demonstrate how the vehicular access network can potentially connect to adjacent areas in the town center so that access is provided to those properties  cthe vehicular access network should provide more than one route in or out of a site within the mixeduse node to provide improved emergency vehicle access and ease local congestion  dthe vehicular access network should include street trees landscaping and streetscape elements primary circulation routes for should be routed around high pedestrian areas and not impact central open spaces  and ethe use of innovative street and access configurations such as woonerfs which mix low speed local vehicular traffic with pedestrians is encouraged where it furthers the objectives of the town center plan and is consistent with the town center infrastructure plan 3parking and access afulfill the intent of parking standards in this title especially smc  blocate parking especially nonstructured parking at the periphery of the mixeduse nodes  and cexploit jointuse parking opportunities wherever possible 4open spaces atca1 a2 and a3 zones should have at least one central open space that acts as a public gathering space and that also includes a significant landscaping element the central open space may be in the form of a town square village green central plaza or other form but should be ringed with active edges pedestrianoriented buildings uses or features that encourage human activity the central open spaces should encourage a variety of activities such as picnicking informal and organized gathering performances and passive and active recreation eg small sports court or childrens play area the open space must be universally accessible meet or exceed ada standards and should incorporate cpted guidelines the central open spaces should also feature isite furniture special paving and amenities  iilighting to encourage evening activities and provide security  iiiart or other features to provide a distinct design identity  ivas a general rule one linear foot of seating per 30 square feet of plaza area not including green space or landscaping  and vareas that are in full sunlight during most of the day  bpublic open spaces should not be adjacent to parking blank walls or spaces or uses without human activity or amenity  cthe central open space for tca1 zone should connect directly to the sammamish commons incorporate low impact developmentstormwater management elements based on the watershed subbasin plan recommendations and take the form of a green spine or other configuration that accomplishes similar objectives see figure 38 in the town center plan  dthe central open space for tca2 zone should connect directly to the wetlandstream corridor in that area  ethe central open space for tca3 zone should be configured so that it focuses land development and human activity in that area  feach mixeduse node should feature a hierarchy of other open spaces connected by the pedestrian network open spaces can be in the form of landscaped linear corridors natural areas gardens residential courts and small parks or play areas see town center plan open space policy os1  and gopen space in the tca1 zone must meet the intent of the adopted town center infrastructure plan 5natural systems and environmental quality amixeduse node uzdps should incorporate and implement stormwater management recommendations from subbasin plans where called for a regional stormwater management system should be implemented  bthe project proponent should indicate how low impact development techniques are incorporated into the uzdp see town center plan goal ns1 and supporting policies  and cthe mixeduse node development should incorporate natural areas such as wetlands stream corridors wildlife corridors and stands of mature trees as amenities into the mixeduse nodes where possible opportunities for natural system restoration should be exploited see figure 54 of the town center plan 6building scale and compatibility abuilding location orientation scale and massing should be configured to minimize impacts to surrounding residential areas and public facilities  and bmixeduse node uzdps should include some building organization or unifying design concept to unify the node and provide a distinctive development character this might be accomplished for example of buildings around open space or other feature use of axial symmetry vistas topography etc or a hierarchy of building massing such as a stepped up wedding cake formation 7affordable housing consistent
