zones in order to carry out the provisions of this article there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces transition surfaces horizontal surface and conical surface such areas are shown on the municipal airport zoning map consisting of one sheet prepared by texas aeronautics commission and dated  which is attached to made a part of this article the various zones are hereby established and defined as follows 1 approach zone the approach zone is established beneath the approach surface at each end of all runways on the airport for nonprecision landings and takeoffs the approach zone shall have a width of 500 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway widening thereafter uniformly to a width of 3500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10200 feet beyond each end of the runway its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway 2 transition zones transition zones are hereby established beneath the transition surface adjacent to each runway and approach surface as indicated on the zoning map transition surfaces symmetrically located on either side of runways have variable widths as shown on the zoning map transition surfaces extend outward from a line 250 feet on either side of the centerline of the runway for the length of such runway plus 200 feet on each end the line is parallel to and level with the runway centerlines the transition surfaces along such runways slope upward and outward one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the point where they intersect the horizontal surface further transition surfaces are established adjacent to approach surfaces for the entire length of the approach surfaces these transition surfaces have variable widths as shown on the zoning map such transition surfaces flare symmetrically with either side of the runway approach surfaces from the base of such surfaces and slope upward and outward at the rate of one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the points where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces 3 horizontal zone the horizontal zone is the area beneath a horizontal

note adopted  amended former art vi  1830118305 in its entirety to read as herein set out former art vi pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the  state law reference flood control and insurance act vtca water et seq statutory authorization findings of fact purpose and methods a statutory authorization the legislature of the state of texas has in the vtca water seq delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council of the city of wharton texas does ordain as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city of wharton are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 avoid increasing flood levels or flood hazards or creating new flood hazard areas  3 minimize public and private property losses due to flooding  4 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  5 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  6 minimize prolonged business interruptions  7 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  8 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  9 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area  and 10 preserve the natural floodplains where at all possible d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning

general purpose a the purpose of this chapter is to establish clear and unambiguous regulations pertaining to signs in the city of wharton and to promote thereby an attractive community foster traffic safety preserve and protect the quality of life and real estate values forming the citys tax base and enhance the effective communication and exchange of ideas and commercial information the city council of the city of wharton hereby finds the following legislative facts 1 the proliferation of signs creates commercial confusion and makes it difficult for travelers and motorists to locate the goods and services they seek 2 the increasing height of signs within the city is an endless battle for higher and more visible signs and a reasonable limitation on the height of signs is necessary to prevent potential visual pollution windstorm damage injury or death 3 excessive height in signs creates visual clutter and the establishment of a reasonable maximum height for signs will allow effective communication pedestrian and vehicular safety and prevent altitude competition 4 reasonable provisions pertaining to size scale location design lighting permanency and maintenance are necessary to avoid visual clutter preserve and improve the appearance and character of the community to avoid traffic lineofsight problems caused by signs or structures in close proximity to streets which compete with traffic signs and signals for the attention of motorists and to prevent deterioration disregard and abandonment of signs or structures b the council recognizes that signs are necessary for visual communication for public convenience and that businesses and other activities have the right to identify themselves by using signs which are incidental to the use on the premises where the signs are located the city council herein seeks to provide a reasonable balance between the right of a person to identify his or her business or activity and the public interest of protecting against visual discord confusion and resulting safety hazards to pedestrians and motoring public that result from the unrestricted proliferation location and construction of signs this chapter will insure that signs are compatible with adjacent land uses and with a positive total visual environment in the community c the city council finds that the rights of residents of this city to fully exercise their rights of free speech by the use of signs containing noncommercial messages are subject to minimum regulation regarding structural safety and setbacks for purposes of traffic and pedestrian protection the council seeks herein to provide for the reasonably prompt removal and disposal of such signs after they have served their purpose and yet to avoid any significant interference with first amendment freedoms d the council finds that instances may occur in the application of this chapter where strict enforcement would deprive a person of the reasonable use of a sign or the reasonable utilization of a sign in connection with other related property rights and herein provides for such persons to have the right to seek variances from the requirements of this chapter for good cause the council finds that it is imperative that any city representative agent or official who is responsible for enforcing the ordinance from which this article derives do so as it is written in the interest of equality and fair and impartial application to all persons and that the use of the variance procedure shall remain the sole administrative means to obtain any exception
