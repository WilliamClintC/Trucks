flood fringe and general floodplain a where floodway and flood fringe districts are delineated on the floodplain maps the standards in or  will apply depending on the location of a property b locations where floodway and flood fringe districts are not delineated on the floodplain maps are considered to fall within the general floodplain district within the general floodplain district the floodway district standards in apply unless the floodway boundary is determined according to the process outlined in once the floodway boundary is determined the flood fringe district standards in may apply outside the floodway subd 2 lands to which this ordinance applies to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city of loretto shown on the official zoning map andor the attachments to the map as
