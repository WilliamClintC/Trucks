flexibility in awarding contracts by authorizing the award of purchase contracts including contracts for service work on the basis of best value the state legislation requires municipalities with a population of less than one million to authorize by local law the use of the best value award process enactment of this legislation provides additional procurement options to localities that may expedite the procurement process and result in cost savings the best value standard for selecting goods and services vendors including janitorial and security contracts is critical to efforts to use strategic sourcing principles to modernize the supply chain and ensure that taxpayers obtain the highest quality goods and services at the lowest potential cost while also ensuring fairness to all competitors the federal government approximately half of the states and many localities have added best value selection processes to their procurement options in recognition of these advantages with the increased complexity of the goods and services that municipalities must obtain in order to serve taxpayers it is critical to consider selection and evaluation criteria that measure factors other than cost in the strictest sense taxpayers are not well served when a public procurement results in low unit costs at the outset but ultimately engenders cost escalations due to factors such as inferior quality poor reliability and difficulty of maintenance best value procurement links the procurement process directly to the municipalitys performance requirements incorporating selection factors such as useful lifespan quality and options for more timely performance andor additional services even if the initial expenditure is higher considering the total value over the life of the procurement may result in a better value and longterm investment of public funds best value procurement also encourages competition and in turn often results in better pricing quality and customer service fostering healthy competition ensures that bidders will continue to strive for the participation of small minority and womenowned businesses and the development of environmentallypreferable goods and service delivery methods best value procurement will provide muchneeded flexibility in obtaining important goods and services at favorable prices and will reduce the time to procure such goods and services ll 20142  2 definition best value means the basis for awarding contracts for services to the offerer who optimizes quality cost and efficiency among responsive and responsible

evaluation process and selection shall be conducted the director of purchasing shall select a formal competitive procurement process in accordance with guidelines established by the city procurement policy and document its determination in the procurement record the process shall include but is not limited to a clear statement of need  a description of the required specifications governing performance and related factors  a reasonable process for ensuring a competitive field  a fair and equal opportunity for offerers to submit responsive offers  and a balanced and fair method of award where the basis for the award is best value documentation in the procurement record shall where practicable include a quantification of the application of the criteria to the rating of proposals and the evaluation results or where not practicable such other justification which demonstrates that best value will be achieved the solicitation shall prescribe the minimum specifications or requirements that must be met in order to be considered responsive and shall describe and disclose the general manner in which the evaluation and selection shall be conducted where appropriate the solicitation shall identify the relative importance andor weight of cost and the overall technical criterion to be considered by the city in its determination of best value the director of purchasing shall develop

land development have a significant impact upon the health safety and welfare of the community specifically the following 1 land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  2 this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  3 clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  4 improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation  5 impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow  6 substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the city  7 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  8 the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public

and density regulations article iii and supplementary district regulations article iv  in addition to the other provisions of this ordinance district intents 2501 residence aa district onefamily large lot intent this district is intended to create preserve and enhance areas of the city composed entirely of single family residences on large lots at low densities with a spacious landscaped appearance and quiet streets this district would be free of disrupting influences and would have only those functions in the district that are necessary and desirable to serve a singlefamily residential neighborhood of this character 2502 residence a district onefamily intent this district is intended to create preserve and enhance areas of the city composed primarily of singlefamily residences built at low or medium densities on quiet streets but which were developed at a period of time in the past when lot sizes were somewhat smaller than those of more recently developed singlefamily neighborhoods these areas are still stable and essentially in sound condition and should be protected from the intrusion of uses and activities incompatible with the character of a singlefamily area because of the older and more modest character of this type of neighborhood a limited amount of uses not of the single family type may have found a place in the district in the past 2503 residence b district onetwo family intent this district is intended to create preserve and enhance areas of the city that are primarily residential in character but which are composed primarily of one and twofamily dwellings on lots large enough to provide parking and open space these districts most often serve as a buffer between residence a and residence c districts 2504 residence c district onefour family intent this district is intended to create preserve and enhance areas of the city that are primarily residential in character but built at a more medium density than any of the previous districts it is expected that these areas would have more traffic on the streets and be convenient to transportation lines  would be more densely built up but still have adequate light and space around the buildings and be well landscaped with mature trees and shrubbery these areas would have been built up in the past years and have undergone some change in use and character with the passage of time and area likely to be located near the central business district or in the vicinity of business subcenters 2505 residence d district multifamily intent this district is intended to create preserve and enhance areas of the city that are primarily residential in character but built to higher densities than any of the previous districts they may be older areas or newer developed or redeveloped areas where the plan of the city determines that it is feasible and desirable to develop certain areas with medium to high concentrations of population due to the availability of adequate public facilities and utilities due to the adequacy of the road and transportation system and where the environment in and around the area is suitable for such type of development it is also the intent of this ordinance that some nonresidential uses would be permitted in this area if they are not incompatible with the character of a higher density residential area but are instead complementary and would enhance the livability of such a neighborhood 2506 business a district neighborhood commercial intent this district is intended to create preserve and enhance business areas of the city that will serve residential neighborhoods this is intended to be a limited business category which has the main purpose of providing daytoday convenient retail needs of nearby residents this district occurs most often at limited corner intersections of main thoroughfares they will generally be areas which will contain several smallscale retail establishments in small clustered groupings serving frequently recurring needs in locations convenient to residences since these districts immediately abut neighboring residential properties emphasis on buffering landscaping scale and size of businesses is essential  business ai neighborhood commerciali intent the intent of this district is the same as the intent and description set forth under section 2506 business a district except bars taverns nightclubs restaurants and restaurantsfast food shall not be permitted 2507 business b district central business district intent this district is intended to create preserve and enhance the elmira central business district as a regional center of shopping  employment  offices  hotels and motels  government  banking investment and financial services  entertainment  and culture 2508 business c district specialized commercial intent this district located along maple avenue on the south side of elmira is intended to recognize the unique mixture of historically significant large homes and structures in the district the district is intended to provide an alternative to sole residential use of these properties by allowing a viable blend of small commercial enterprises on premises also containing residential units such uses are specifically intended to include small retail specialty shops that fulfill a specific function in the marketplace care should be taken to protect the unique aesthetic value of the area from typical commercial or suburbanlike development 2509 business d district historic commercial intent this district located along west church street on the north side of elmira is intended to recognize the unique role which the historic district has played in the formation growth and life of the city of elmira due to the location along a major transportation route in the city the area has evolved into a mixed use serviceresidential area that is close in but functions secondary to the central business district because this area is within an historic district many of the structures have remained intact and green landscaping has taken priority over parking lots the intent is to preserve the use function and appearance that exists as of the date of this ordinance 25010 business e district general commercial intent this district is intended to create preserve and enhance business areas devoted to general commercial services and wholesaling activities such areas would include a variety of commercial enterprises which are essential to the economy of the city but which are frequently incompatible with residential areas and with the operations of a retail shopping or office area or other types of business areas but are typically appropriate to centralized areas near major arterials industrial concentrations or in the vicinity of transportation lines or transportation terminal points 25011 business g district gateway commercial intent this district is intended to protect and enhance the primary gateways into the city of elmira from nys route 17 along east church and east water streets it is characterized by its location along a major thoroughfare and proximity to commercial cultural and employment centers in permitting mixed uses this district will maximize the benefits of location and existing infrastructure such as public transportation sewer and water the traffic and activity of this area lessens the desirability for single family living while the accessibility and exposure provide an environment suitable for certain professional and business offices which can exist in close proximity to dwellings without adversely affecting the residential environment the location of commercial and office uses in this district should not necessarily be related to retail trade rather the commercial and office uses should complement and provide basic services to the residential use all development within this district should maintain a high quality of development so as to enhance plantings and minimal curbcuts along east church street the citys primary gateway 25012 ha district hospital intent the provisions of this section are intended to create preserve and enhance integrated and unified hospital areas devoted to medical surgical and other therapeutic establishments within attractive welllandscaped settings with good transportation services and adequate amounts of parking 25013 hed district higher educational intent this district is intended to recognize and manage the orderly development of institutions of higher education and their attendant uses  to promote compatibility with adjacent noneducational zoning districts  and provide for the effective utilization of land located within the district 25014 industrial a district light industrial intent this district is intended to create preserve and enhance industrial areas devoted primarily to manufacturing establishments research establishments and other nonresidential and nonbusiness types of activities which have limited external impact on surrounding areas because of their appearance their method of operation and their use of public facilities and utilities such operations ordinarily have little influence on the neighborhood in the way of emission of smoke noise vibrations etc 25015 industrial b district general industrial intent this district is intended to create preserve and enhance industrial areas devoted to manufacturing and other nonbusiness and nonresidential uses which are potentially incompatible with most other activities and are typically appropriate to areas of the city which are somewhat distant from residential areas which have access to suitable and adequate railroad highway or other transportation and shipping facilities it is the expectation that such manufacturing or other nonresidential uses would have operating characteristics that are considered more obnoxious or unpleasant than those in industrial a districts but would not be so obnoxious nor unpleasant that they would be detrimental to surrounding properties or to any other part of the city 25016 conservation district floodplains hilly slopes intent this district is intended to create preserve and enhance areas of the city for the protection of floodplains natural water basins and steep lands abutting limited access highways where uncontrolled development would be adverse to community values and adverse to the public health safety and general welfare of the city 25017 residence p district planned residential intent this district is intended to permit and encourage the development of wellplanned highdensity residential neighborhoods or groups of residences on sites larger than normal building lots to give the site planner more freedom more intensive use of land may be permitted and the coverage height setback and other requirements may be varied if certain requirements are met which will ensure a more imaginative use of a building site than can be achieved under the other regulations of this ordinance it is the intent of this section to stimulate the construction of multiplefamily developments that will be a continuing asset to the city of elmira and will promote a stable healthy and safe environment it is likely that these areas would be found adjacent to or near the central business district in older established areas of the city and around existing business subcenters or in the vicinity of activities employing a large number of people 25018 residence paa district planned lowdensity residential intent this district is intended to permit and encourage the development of wellplanned low density residential neighborhoods or groups of dwelling units on sites larger than normal building lots this type of development is characterized primarily as a home of ownership area including the condominium form of ownership of residential units to give the architect and site planner adequate flexibility to permit more creative and imaginative building and site design than can be achieved under the other regulations of this ordinance governing residence aa districts more intensive uses of land are permitted and the coverage height setback and other requirements are varied if certain additional requirements for such districts are met such developments are conceived of as being planned in their entirety to allow the development to make the most efficient use of the land and of existing buildings these developments would be designed and built so that careful attention is given to the placement and interrelationships of buildings parking spaces landscaping and other features of development to each other as well to neighboring properties developments of this type also are expected to be characterized by a high degree of sensitivity to the protection and enhancement of existing historic structures and natural features of the site 25019 industrial p district planned industrial intent this district is intended to create preserve and enhance integrated and unified industrial parks devoted to industrial manufacturing and research establishments within attractive well landscaped settings with good transportation service and adequate amounts of offstreet parking such industrial parks are typically appropriate to locations near major thoroughfares and near good shipping and receiving facilities for supplies and goods because such industrial parks are likely to cover a relatively large area of land they would ordinarily be located in undeveloped or underdeveloped parts of the city separated from residential communities or in blighted builtup areas that would be redeveloped for such use  1032005   11282005 use table requirements uses permitted in each zoning district shall be those set forth in the use table table 260 table 260 use

sexually oriented businesses 4571 purpose and intent a recognition of need it is hereby specifically recognized that sexually oriented businesses have promoted serious adverse secondary effects in many of the municipalities in which they operate  including but not necessarily limited to increases in prostitution pandering child endangerment violent crimes against persons and property as well as increases in other types of serious crimes and criminal enterprises  the increased proliferation of sexually transmitted diseases as well as other serious communicable diseases such as hepatitis and the like  the spread of urban blight and commensurate decrease in property values and the general degradation of the quality of urban life in addition that these adverse secondary effects precipitate a deleterious impact on sensitive areas of the community such as churches synagogues and other places of worship schools child care centers adult care facilities and the like as well as promote the spread of urban blight which decreases property values and hinders economic vitality generally as a result of said adverse secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses said sexually oriented businesses require heightened supervision from public health and safety agencies in order to protect the health safety and welfare of the patrons of such businesses as well as the residents of the city of elmira furthermore the city council recognizes that licensing zoning and other traditional municipal regulations are legitimate reasonable means of accountability to insure compliance with this ordinance so as to control and minimize the adverse secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses b due diligence the city council in and for the city of elmira has carefully and meticulously reviewed numerous case studies which relate the existence and impact of these adverse secondary effects on various municipalities  evidence of the existence of said secondary effects and their impact on the city of elmira  implications regarding the introduction and expansion of such secondary effects within the city of elmira and the potential impact thereof  various united states supreme court and new york court decisions relating to the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  as well as the various and balanced comments and concerns advanced by the citizens of the city of elmira and communityatlarge c nonprejudiced representation the city council in and for the city of elmira is charged with and dutifully respects and adheres to the mandate to effectively govern without bias for nor prejudice against any entity residing or doing business within the city of elmira d proactive government in furtherance of this charge the city council in and for the city of elmira specifically recognizes that it need not remain quiescent and thereby risk the expansion of or influx of said adverse secondary effects but rather may proactively govern in order to manage and reduce the secondary effects that currently do exist as well as effectively manage and control future secondary effects including but not limited to the legitimate concern of the city council to protect the health and safety of its citizens all of which therefore compels the implementation of reasonable regulation of sexually oriented businesses e need for distance buffer zones in drafting and passing this ordinance the city council in and for the city of elmira has carefully considered among other issues the need to protect sensitive areas and uses of land within the city of elmira by establishing minimum distances buffering said sensitive areas and uses from sexually oriented businesses thereby reducing the potential for impact by the secondary effects associated with said sexually oriented businesses these sensitive areas are generally and normally associated with a decreased need to be on the alert for and defend against the heretofore mentioned adverse secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses or represent areas which are generally and normally used by or associated with certain segments of the population atlarge who because of age or mental capacity are unable to defend against said adverse secondary effects such considerations include but are not necessarily limited to the following 1 in order to protect children from the dangers of the heretofore referenced adverse secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses areas within the vicinity of single and multiple family dwellings as well as uses normally associated with the care education or housing of children should be free of said sexually oriented businesses  2 in order to protect the serene quality of certain areas normally associated with a decreased level of a need to be on heightened alert for the heretofore mentioned adverse secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses areas within the vicinity of churches public parks schools places of public assembly and residential uses should be free of said sexually oriented businesses  and 3 that no evidence has been presented to demonstrate that the location of sexually oriented businesses within the city of elmira in violation of the provisions of this ordinance will improve the commercial viability or quality of life in the community f need for additional regulations in addition the city council in and for the city of elmira has determined that the distance buffer zone criteria alone does not adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of the people of the city of elmira and that therefore certain additional regulations with respect to the ownership management and operation of sexually oriented businesses is in the public interest therefore this ordinance is enacted to more effectively manage control minimize and abate said harmful secondary effects that do exist  reduce the possibility of a future increase in said secondary effects  protect the health safety and general welfare of the residents of the city of elmira  promote preserve and protect the distinguished character of the city of elmira and quality of urban life

said lot is located  and 3 that the special circumstances or unique conditions have not resulted from any act of the applicant subsequent to the adoption of this ordinance  and 4 that the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of this ordinance and will not be injurious to the neighborhood will not alter the essential character of the locality will not
