supervisors of towamencin township montgomery county pennsylvania finds that a inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout the township increases flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development activities causing accelerated erosion and connections and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the township and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge d stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater f federal and state regulations require the township to implement a program of stormwater controls the township is required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from its separate storm sewer system under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permittees are required to enact implement and enforce a prohibition of

legislative intent the board of supervisors of towamencin township finds that certain residential areas of townships are subject to commuter vehicle parking therefore depriving the residents of those areas of spaces in which to park their own vehicles  those residential streets are also subject to a high degree of commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the ambient air level  and the overburdening of existing streets and roads generally creates an undesirable dangerous condition to the general health safety and welfare of the community therefore the township supervisors wish to establish a residential parking permit program for certain affected areas where parking is limited by township ordinance  it being the belief of the supervisors that it is in the best interest of the people of the township to provide for the establishment of such a residential parking zone  14718 definitions for the purpose of this article words and terms listed in this section as follows shall have the following meanings commuter vehicle  a motor vehicle parked in a residential area by a person not a resident of that residential area dwelling unit  a single unit providing complete independent living facilities for one or more persons including permanent provisions for living which normally include provisions for sleeping eating cooking and sanitation but also includes rooms
