astatement of purpose and effect the wtto wireless telecommunication tower overlay district is established to provide for the construction and use of wireless telecommunication towers and facilities as a permitted use conditional use or accessory use depending upon the specific land areas of the city and circumstances in which they are proposed to be located the purpose of the overlay district is to balance the competing interests created by the federal telecommunications act of 1996 public law 104104 and the interests of the city in regulating wireless telecommunication towers and related facilities for the following reasons to provide for orderly development within the city  to protect property values  to maintain the aesthetic appearance of the city  to provide for and protect the health safety and general welfare of the residents of the city  to protect residential properties parks open spaces and the commercial zoning districts from the adverse effects of towers and related facilities  to promote collocation of wireless telecommunication facilities in order to decrease the number of towers in the city  and to maintain where possible the integrity of existing zoning regulations contained in this zoning wireless telecommunication tower overlay district regulations shall control and supersede wherever they are inconsistent with other provisions of this zoning no inconsistency exists between the provisions of this overlay district and the provisions of the underlying zoning district the underlying zoning district regulations and other provisions of this zoning
