adult minimotion picture theaters adult modeling studios adult motion picture arcades or theaters adult novelty businesses adult saunas and similar adult oriented services operating under different

types described above and all other similar establishments whose services include sessions offered to adults conducted in private by members of the same or opposite sex and employing personnel with no specialized training are susceptible to operation in a manner contravening subverting or endangering the morals of the community by being the site of acts of prostitution illicit sex and occasions of violent crimes and thus requiring close inspection licensing and regulation the city council also finds that control and regulation of commercial establishments of these types in view of the abuses often perpetrated require intensive efforts by the police department and other departments of the city as a consequence the concentrated use of city services in such control detracts from and reduces the level of service available to the rest of the community and thereby diminishes the ability of the city to promote the general health welfare morals and safety of the community in consideration for the necessity on the part of the city to provide numerous services to all segments of the community without a concentration of public services in one area working to the detriment of the members of

24 article i  in general citation this chapter may be cited as the woodbury subdivision  or as the subdivision  01 11142012 introduction a in the course of development on a large or small scale land holdings are divided into lots with provision for access possibly by new streets provision for basic utilities or private sewer and water facilities and the like the final land development is greatly dependent on the very basic steps taken in drawing the lot lines the street rightofway and so on for the best results it may be wise to combine parcels of land to divide others or to totally revise the lot lines of a tract of land the subdivision combination or resubdivision of land is the first step in shaping the physical character of a communitys development and as such all are important processes which should be subject to public regulation b the conversion of land into building sites is a process which requires careful regulation to ensure an attractive efficient and safe community environment provision must be made for adequate and safe water and sewer facilities  the system of neighborhood streets must provide convenient access without dangerous intersections  procedures must be developed to allow the public acquisition of needed land for community facilities  and other improvements must be required to be consistent with the general public welfare and safety provision must also be made for possible future resubdivision after a subdivision of a land parcel has been approved and buildings permitted  the same standards should be met by any such future resubdivision c each new subdivision becomes a permanent unit in the basic physical structure of the community a unit to which the future community will of necessity be forced to adhere piecemeal planning of such subdivisions without correlation to a plan will bring a disconnected patchwork of plats and poor circulation of traffic so that new subdivisions contribute toward an attractive orderly stable and

improvements and would not burden the existing tax base by increasing development or in areas without adequate infrastructure or public facilities 5 the pud can be planned and developed to harmonize with any existing or proposed development in the areas surrounding the project site the uses proposed will not have an undue and adverse impact on the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property and will not be detrimental to potential surrounding uses 6 the tract under consideration is under single ownership or control 7 singlefamily detached units or clustering of housing units may be allowed as a pud in areas providing urban services or in the r2 estate district providing parks and open space are an integral part of the plan 8 each phase of the development as it is proposed to be completed is of sufficient size composition and arrangement that its construction marketing and operation are feasible as a complete unit and that provision and construction of dwelling units and common open space are balanced and coordinated 9 common elements proposed as part of the pud are appropriate for the scale location shape size density and topography of the development and must be suitably improved for the intended uses except that significant natural features may be preserved or restored 10 the project area is at least ten acres in size unless the applicant can show that a pud of less acreage meets the standards and purposes of the comprehensive plan and preserves the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city and that all of the following conditions exist a the proposal better adapts itself to the physical and aesthetic setting of the site and with the surrounding land uses than could be developed using strict standards and land uses allowed within the underlying zoning district b the proposal would benefit the area surrounding the project to greater degree than development allowed within the underlying zoning districts c the proposal would provide mixed land use andor site design flexibilities while enhancing site or building aesthetics to achieve an overall workable higher quality of development than would otherwise occur in the underlying zoning district d if applicable the proposal would increase open or green space or ensure the concentration of open space into more workable or usable areas and would preserve the natural resources of the site than would otherwise occur in the underlying zoning district 01 10102012 approval and implementation a the city council shall review the pud conditional use permit application if the pud is
