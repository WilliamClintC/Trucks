general provisions  1201 findings and purpose the purpose of this chapter of the city code is to prohibit certain conduct that is harmful to the health safety and welfare of the community and to prevent and abate nuisance conduct events characteristics or conditions and their deleterious effects on city neighborhoods by maximizing the means and methods by which public officers can efficiently and effectively enforce the law and by imposing and collecting nuisance service call fees from the owner or occupant or both of private property to which public officers are repeatedly called to respond to nuisance violations as set forth in articles i and ii of this chapter of city code the city council finds that excessive noise disruption and other public nuisance activities are injurious to the public health safety and welfare and interfere with the quiet enjoyment of life and property and that nuisance service calls unduly divert law enforcement resources from general crime prevention and law enforcement the nuisance service call fee is intended as a cost recovery mechanism for excessive law enforcement services over and above the cost of normal law enforcement services to the public attributable to unabated nuisance conduct conditions or characteristics occurring maintained or permitted to exist on the private property it is not intended to constitute punishment separate from or in addition to any criminal prosecution for the conduct underlying the nuisance or nuisance service calls nothing herein is meant to limit constitutional rights under the federal or

passed 5152000  1271 findings the city council makes the following findings regarding the need to promptly remove graffiti from private and public property agraffiti constitutes a form of vandalism defacing public and private property without the permission of the owner and causing citizens businesses and the city to incur the cost of repair and removal bgraffiti is a visual symbol of disorder eroding public safety contributing to a downward spiral of blight and decay lessening property values business viability and ultimately tax revenues and as such is inconsistent with the citys property maintenance goals and aesthetic standards cthere is substantial evidence that prompt eradication of graffiti is an effective prevention strategy which discourages its return while failure to promptly remove graffiti increases the likelihood that more graffiti will occur on the same site and on other nearby property dthe failure to maintain ones property by removing graffiti which has been declared by the city to constitute a public nuisance within a reasonable period of time is injurious to the public health safety morals and general welfare of the residents of the city 1958 04 added by passed

statement afindings the city council makes the following findings regarding the need to regulate medical marijuana distribution facilities within the city 1since 197 federal law has prohibited the manufacture and possession of marijuana as a schedule i drug under 21 usc  801 et seq because of this credit card companies will not authorize medical marijuana transactions and therefore the medical marijuana business must consist of primarily cash transactions 2medical marijuana customers must under the state act be certified by a health care practitioner as having a medical condition that has been determined by the commissioner under the act to be a qualifying condition  however under federal law physicians cannot legally prescribe medical marijuana thus customers must visit the medical marijuana distribution facility to be seen by a pharmacist who determines the type and dosage of medical marijuana appropriate for their condition 3medical marijuana customers with qualifying conditions will include individuals with severely compromised immune systems or other significant health conditions making them extremely vulnerable targets for thieves seeking either the cash they carry for the product or the product itself the commissioner has indicated that the field of qualifying conditions is likely to expand to cover chronic pain and that this expansion will greatly

the propensity of pawnbrokers to attract criminals attempting to conduct transactions involving stolen goods pawnshops have the potential to be generally injurious to the maintenance and development

purpose the city council finds that substantial scientific evidence exists that the use of tobaccorelated products causes cancer heart disease and various other medical disorders it is the further finding of the city council that the present legislative scheme of prohibiting sales of tobaccorelated products to persons under the age of 18 has proven ineffective in preventing such persons from using tobaccorelated products the city council has concluded that youth and young adults have ready access to selfservice merchandising including vending machines which sell tobaccorelated products and that the prohibition of the sale or dispensing of tobaccorelated products machines and the regulation of sales service merchandising will thereby promote the health safety and welfare of the residents of the city particularly those residents under 21 years of age the city council also finds that marketing and public health research shows how flavors such as fruit candy and sweet tasting products hold an intense appeal to minors further the city council finds that tobacco manufacturer spending on advertising marketing and price is directed at youth and young adults the majority of smokers start young youth get tobacco from older peers and exposure to nicotine is particularly dangerous to the adolescent brain therefore the purpose of this ordinance is to reduce the appeal to youth and young adults and reduce the likelihood that youth and young adults will become users of tobaccorelated products later in life passed 7271992  recodified by passed 871995  amended by passed

precious metal dealers potentially provide an opportunity for the commission of crimes and their concealment because such businesses have the ability to receive and transfer stolen property easily and quickly the city council also finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving precious metal dealers due in part to the much greater intrinsic value of this merchandise its general lack of unique identifiers and its greater liquidity measures to prevent stolen property from being sold to precious metal dealers are necessitated by the fact that there are few government regulations applicable to this industrys purchase of precious metal items from the public or to effectively and efficiently identify potential criminal activity related to these businesses an automated system of tracking merchandise and purchasing transactions will decrease and stabilize the costs associated with the regulation of this industry and will increase the identification of criminal activities in the precious metal business pursuant to its authority under the city charter and under ms  325f742 as it may be amended from time to time the city council

maintaining and operating the system imposition of charges as provided in this cin imposing charges it is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable taking into account the status of completion of the system past methods of recovering system cost the topography of the city and other relevant factors it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for some or all of the future costs of operating maintaining and improving the system on the basis of the expected volume of storm water runoff from the various parcels of land within the city during a standard rainfall event for the purposes of this a standard rainfall event is defined as the oneyear storm of oneday duration in addition it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for some or all of the future costs of operating maintaining and improving the system on the basis of the expected pollutant loading from the various

ref and the quality ref for the single family residential land use classification the utility ref for each of the land use classifications will be revised at such time in the future when there is a shift in the percentage of utility expenditures related to storm water runoff volume and storm water runoff quality treatment the revision will be determined by the director of public works who will notify the city council of the action bstorm water drainage charges in determining charges the city council will by resolution establish a basic system rate to be charged against one acre of land

the need to prohibit certain signs in all zoning districts of the city 1the placement and accumulation of temporary and permanent signs in public rightsofway on traffic and utility devices and upon the public sidewalks or on sidewalk easements can present dangerous conditions to the free and safe flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic such areas should be reserved for official traffic signs and official utility notices in order to assure the safe flow of traffic 2the accumulation of signs on publicly owned property and buildings presents an intrusion and blight on public property interferes with and diminishes the very purpose for which the public space has been reserved and disrupts the aesthetic qualities of such property 3the placement and accumulation of signs on such natural features as trees shrubs and rocks violate the otherwise aesthetic qualities of such features and can lead to blighted areas within the community 4the experience of this and surrounding communities establishes the unsightly visual clutter caused by portable signs which can significantly contribute to blighted neighborhoods and intersections such portable signs also present unique safety problems in that their lightweight design and common placement along streets and sidewalks present hazards to the safe use of public streets and sidewalks 5large temporary and permanent balloon signs located on buildings roofs and sites present unique aesthetic concerns to the community the experience of this city in allowing such large balloon signs on a temporary basis in the past has not achieved the aesthetic goals of the city council the balloons have been shown to be of an obtrusive nature and have allowed commercial enterprises to violate the prescribed signage limits of this 6the installation and maintenance of roof signs can negatively affect roofing materials roof signs have been found in this community to be unwarranted and unsightly additions to the overall clutter of streets and thoroughfares bprohibited signs 1signs in the public rightsofway or affixed to utility poles prohibited ano person shall paint mark or write on or post or otherwise affix any sign within

afindings and purpose the city council finds that the preservation and development of parks recreational facilities playgrounds trails wetlands and open space areas within the city are essential to maintaining a healthy and desirable environment for residents and persons employed within the city and it also finds that the value and attractiveness of residential and commercialindustrial developments to land owners developers purchasers employers and employees is significantly enhanced by the presence of such park and open space amenities the city council finds that development of land for residential commercial and industrial purposes creates a need for park and recreational land and facilities within the city the council finds that residential development creates approximately 90% of this need and that commercialindustrial development creates approximately 10% of this need ms   subd 2b as it may be amended from time to time provides that municipal subdivision regulations may require that a reasonable portion of any proposed subdivision be dedicated to the public or preserved for public use as parks recreational facilities playgrounds trails wetlands or open space and that the municipality may alternatively accept an equivalent amount in cash the city council finds that it is appropriate that each development within the city contribute toward the citys park system in proportion to the burden it will place upon that system therefore these park dedication regulations are established to require new developments at the time of subdivision to contribute toward the citys park system in rough proportion to the relative burden they will place upon that system bdefinitions for the purpose of this section the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning development employees refers to the approximate number of employees that will result from the proposed commercialindustrial development of the land being subdivided and it is equal to the product of athe number of square feet of floor area of the structural improvements in the proposed commercialindustrial development  and
