facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass 2 the term severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b allowed bypass a user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but

casebycase basis if the oral report is received within 24 hours d enforcement action  approved bypass 1 bypass is prohibited and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required under

division 2  establishment intentdistrict  categories the intent of this division is to recognize the various ways in which people make use of land and buildings and to classify such uses by relative compatibility and their relationship to various community facilities and services  to delineate areas of relatively compatible use into zoning districts that permit certain dimensional and other requirements for the use of such land and buildings although human activities and use of the land can be classified in various ways this chapter establishes five broad categories with recognition of some overlapping and intermingling common to all five categories as permitted are the streets walkways underground pipes overhead wires and surface ditches which are used to move people goods energy wastes sounds and images the categories and their intent are as follows 1 planned development district for urban activities in which buildings land use transportation facilities utility systems and open spaces are integrated overall design 2 agricultural for rural activities primarily related to use of the land in its natural state for raising crops or livestock or leaving the land in its natural state 3 residential for urban activities primarily related to the social family such as the primary place of being together with ones family or being alone for eating sleeping recreation and other nonwork activities 4 business for urban activities related to the exchange of services and manufactured goods that provide for physical social and economic needs common to all residents 5 manufacturing for urban activities related to the production of goods which must precede their availability for purchase in the business areas of the community app a art iv  1   sameplanned development district the planned development zoning district is established to permit flexibility and design innovation in the site planning and land use to provide open space and recreational areas and options in land development which encourage imaginative solutions to environmental design problems app a art iv  2   sameagricultural areas only one agricultural district is established in this chapter an a1 agricultural district the intent is to recognize the agricultural needs of the community it also is used as a holding zone for newly annexed areas where additional study may be necessary before designation into the appropriate urban zoning district it also permits singlefamily use app a art iv  3   sameresidential areas the intent of the residential zoning districts is to accommodate the private living needs of individuals and families in a variety of building types and in locations generally separated from commercial and industrial activities the intent of providing variety is achieved by establishing residential districts with variation in lot sizes and other dimensional requirements the residential districts include the following 1 r1a residential district for singlefamily detached homes on lots of at least 10000 square feet with certain other dimensional requirements for light air and personal preference 2 r1b residential district for singlefamily detached

other dimensional requirements 4 r2 twofamily residential district for buildings as permitted by section 114185 placed side by side or one above the other on lots of at least 7500 square feet 5 r3 low density apartment district for buildings as permitted by section 114186 where floor area can equal no more than half of the land area 6 r4 medium density apartment district for buildings as permitted by section 114187 where floor area can equal no more than 70 percent of the land area 7 r5 high density apartment district for buildings as permitted by section 114188 8 residential area modifiers other sections of this chapter may modify some of the residential zones and their requirements as described in this section 9 gc golf course community district the gc golf course community zoning district has been established to permit residential development in areas developed integrally with a new andor existing golf course it is the intent of this district to permit golf course development by providing for a more flexible placing of buildings on land and providing for flexibility in accessory uses associated with a golf course while protecting the integrity of the surrounding residential community in addition to the requirements specified herein for this zoning district the planning commission andor the board of mayor and aldermen may impose any reasonable conditions deemed necessary to safeguard the health safety welfare and property values of the surrounding area of the city 10 the uae urban agricultural estate zoning district the uae urban agricultural estate

this chapter business areas are intended for the sale or exchange of goods and services conveniently located to their users and giving proper recognition to safe and efficient traffic control adequate

dangerous the major streets and highways that originally attracted them to such locations 6 b4p planned business development district for planned business developments that are coordinated with adjacent activities the purpose is to permit a more efficient integrated and aesthetically pleasing environment than generally is the case in the other business zones 7 bc business conference center

requirements of landscape plans see the article vii of this chapter landscaping 5 architectural design a compatible relationship for proposed developments in the gateway district overlay is of critical public concern for any building or site improvements the intent of the design review is not to stifle innovative architecture but to ensure respect while reducing incompatible and adverse impacts on the visual experience from the roadways the commission may alter corporate colors or architectural designs within the district to create a compatible visual image to accomplish this the gateway review commission shall exercise the following guidelines for review of such proposed developments a materials selection and use of building materials should respect the climate and heritage

with those of the primary structure and shall be roofed if the contents are visible from any public street interstate expressway or arterial street 6 signs although signs occupy little space they have a major impact on the image of the gateway district overlay for this reason signage systems must be designed to create a consistent quality image throughout the district specific requirements can be found in article iv of this chapter signs additional requirements are set forth in this document that also apply within the gateway district overlay the intent is to create a cohesive image and to consistently decrease the amount of clutter and visual disturbance within the district any appeals to the following standards must be presented to the gateway review commission a permanent signs will

maintain the vegetation may be counted towards meeting performance criteria for buffers streetscapes open space and interior parking areas 1 a five to 20 percent reduction in the number of parking spaces required on the site may be allowed to the extent that the reduction in the amount of pavement will preserve existing healthy trees in an undisturbed natural condition 2 a ten percent reduction in the amount of pervious area is required on the site if public artspace in a compatible manner is included in the development 3 a reduction in required landscaping may be considered if the development includes innovative sitebuilding design concepts substantial redevelopment of a site or if natural constraints exist 4 the area used for preservation of existing healthy vegetation in the
