d relocation below if the completed foundation does not extend beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure and the foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated by more than three 3 additional feet as measured from the uphill side of the structure it shall not be considered to be an expansion of the structure 3 special expansion allowance existing principal and accessory structures that exceed the floor area or height limits set in divisions c1c and d above may not be expanded except that the limits may be exceeded by not more than 500 square feet provided that all of the following requirements are met a the principal structure is set back at least 50 feet horizontal distance from the normal highwater line of a water body tributary stream or upland edge of a

allowable footpath there exists complete natural ground cover consisting of forest duff shrubs and other woody and herbaceous vegetation within 50 feet horizontal distance of the normal highwater line where natural ground cover is lacking the area must be supplemented with leaf or bark mulch and plantings of native shrubs and other woody and herbaceous vegetation not lawns in quantities sufficient to retard erosion and provide for effective infiltration of stormwater d a written plan by the property owner including a scaled site drawing is approved by the planning board and is developed implemented and maintained to address the following mitigation measures for the property within the shoreland zone 1 unstabilized areas resulting in soil erosion must be mulched seeded or otherwise stabilized and maintained to prevent further erosion and sedimentation to water bodies tributary stream and wetlands  roofs and associated drainage systems driveways parking areas and other nonvegetated surfaces must be designed or modified as necessary to prevent concentrated flow of storm water runoff from reaching a water body tributary stream or wetland where possible runoff must be directed vegetated area or infiltrated into the soil use of a well stone apron rain garden or similar device 4 planting requirements any planting or revegetation required as a condition to the special expansion allowance must be in accordance with a written plan drafted by a qualified professional be implemented at the time of construction and be designed to meet the rating scores contained in paragraph b and the ground cover requirements of paragraph c when the vegetation matures within the 50foot strip at a minimum the plan must provide for the establishment of a welldistributed planting of saplings spaced so that there is at least one sapling per 80 square feet of newly established buffer planted saplings may be no less than three 3 feet tall for coniferous species and no less than six feet tall for deciduous species the planting plan must include a mix of at least three native tree species found growing in adjacent areas with no one species making up more than 50% of the number

future owners 5 filing and reporting requirements written plans required pursuant to this section must be filed with the androscoggin county registry of deeds within fourteen 14 days of approval a copy of all permits issued pursuant to this section must be forwarded by the municipality to the department of environmental protection within 14 days of the issuance of the permit 6 no structure which is less than the required setback from the normal highwater line of a water body tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland shall be expanded toward the water body tributary stream or wetland as defined herein d relocation a nonconforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the officer and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of state law and the state of maine subsurface wastewater disposal rules rules or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said rules in no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be more nonconforming in determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the officer shall consider the size of the lot the slope of the land the potential for soil erosion the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties the location of the septic system and other onsite soils suitable for septic systems and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation when it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure the planning board shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation in addition the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation replanting shall be required as follows 1 trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree three 3 feet in height for every tree removed if more than five trees are planted no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland than the trees that were removed other woody and herbaceous vegetation and ground cover that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be reestablished an area at least the same size as the area where vegetation andor ground cover was disturbed damaged or removed must be reestablished within the setback area the vegetation andor ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation andor ground cover that was disturbed destroyed or removed 2 where feasible when a structure is relocated on a parcel the original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses shrubs trees or a combination thereof e reconstruction or replacement 1 any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed damaged or destroyed regardless of the cause by more than 50% of the market value of the structure before such damage destruction or removal may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained within eighteen months of the date of said damage or destruction or removal and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the water body tributary stream or wetland setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board in accordance with the purposes of this no case shall the structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its nonconformity if the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure except as allowed pursuant to c above as determined by the nonconforming floor area of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location if the total amount of floor area of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure when it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with d above any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value or damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the market value of the structure excluding normal maintenance and repair may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained from the officer within one year of such damage destruction or removal in determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the water setback to the greatest practical extent the planning board shall consider in addition to the criteria in d the physical condition and type of foundation present if any 2 any nonconforming structure which is located more than the required setback from the normal high water line of a water body tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland and which is removed damaged or destroyed by fire lightning wind or other natural disaster it may be rebuilt provided that construction is commenced within two 2 years after the destruction of the building or structure and is substantially completed within three 3 years after such destruction 21014 nonconforming uses a
