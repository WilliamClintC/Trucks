& health 158 supplement a 69 august 1997 e certain outdoor events such as parades festivals and other public gatherings result in nonsmokers finding themselves in close proximity to persons who are smoking which can be reasonably seen to have the same effects of exposure as when nonsmokers are exposed to smoke in the same enclosed space lighted cigarettes cigars and pipes of people standing or sitting in close proximity have the potential of burning those with whom they inadvertently come into direct contact and making the air quality and peaceful enjoyment of outdoor events unreasonably restricted for nonsmokers f when there is a presence of secondhand smoke in enclosed spaces or in outside areas where there is a public gathering resulting in people being in close proximity in places that are otherwise open to the public at large inevitably results in persons who do not smoke being forced to bear unwarranted health risks and inappropriate deprivation of peaceful enjoyment of the premises to which they have been invited or permitted to enter even when steps have been taken to separate smoking and nonsmoking areas within the confined space g the town recognizes that smoke

problems and dam safety issues a water quality 1 framework altering the natural flow of water can lead to eutrophication a process by which a standing body of water becomes enriched with excess plant nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen which results in excess algal production this condition leads to lower dissolved oxygen do levels which can have a detrimental effect on fish species and water quality artificial impoundments also lead to higher water temperatures and excess sedimentation also harmful to aquatic species artificial lakes in the town of lexington should be planned carefully with a view towards ecological consequences 2 recommendation developers should take appropriate steps to maintain good water quality in artificial lakes developing a longterm strategy for maintaining water quality is recommended this strategy may include the use of greater setbacks for principal structures and associated buildings with impermeable surfaces from the normal high water mark of the water body vegetative buffers along the edge of the water body or the installation of an aeration system to maintain a healthy level of do in the water body b dams 1 framework a dam breach

require certain land parcels located within reasonable distance from monumented control points to be referenced by field survey to geodetic control points which are defined by state plane coordinates in cases where monumented control points are not within a reasonable distance as defined in this chapter the requirement will be to reference the survey to points which are identifiable on the county orthophoto maps property surveys affected by   be referenced to accurate geographical locations and therefore can be plotted in their correct position on the state plane coordinate based county mapping system these positions can be reproduced to the same accuracy as the original determination even if all physically platted corners or supporting evidence or both has been destroyed b this will improve greatly county land records by allowing ground surveys to be easily and accurately translated to county maps hardcopy or electronic in addition land owners will benefit in that property corners tied directly to monumented geodetic control by field surveys are defined by mathematical references which cannot be destroyed  therefore in the future missing or destroyed property corners can be more easily reestablished with a high level of confidence c this concept has existed for many years but it has not been practical to apply on the county level until recent developments in technology allowed the costeffective production of accurate mapping systems and the placement of closelyspaced geodetic control monuments defined by very accurate coordinates in addition the recent

geodetic control  art 11 part passed 2199    surveys exempt from geodetic control monument tie a it is considered very desirable for surveyors to tie all surveys whenever possible to the state plane coordinate system nothing in these exemptions is intended to discourage surveyors from tying surveys to the state plane coordinate system b the following surveys are exempted from geodetic control monument tie 1 mortgage surveys of residential property in existing subdivisions  2 any survey not specified in    art 11 part passed 2199    surveys requiring orthophoto locator tie a with the exception of mortgage surveys all surveys not tied to geodetic control shall have a locator tie a locator tie is defined as a bearing and distance tie from a property corner to a point identifiable on the orthophoto map such as a building corner a road intersection with a driveway or other point that can be accurately spotted on the orthophoto b to support this requirement the county will make copies of the county orthophoto maps available to licensed surveyors at a reasonable cost special pricing to surveyors will be contingent upon these maps being for the surveyors use only  art 11 part passed 2199    survey requirements survey requirements specified in this chapter are only for control survey connections between geodetic survey monuments and land parcels boundary surveys shall be

findings of fact the special flood hazard areas of the town of lexington are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare furthermore these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages  1att passed 61118    statement of purpose and objectives it is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health minimize property damage and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion are restricted or prohibited these provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters and control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion additionally the chapter prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands the objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area the provisions of the chapter are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in the floodplain and prolonged business interruptions also an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding floodplains are an important asset to the community they perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters moderation of peak flood flows maintenance of water quality groundwater recharge prevention of erosion habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality these functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state wherever possible the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced decisions to alter floodplains especially floodways and stream channels should be the result of careful planning processes that evaluate resource conditions and human needs  1att passed 61118    lands to which this chapter applies this chapter shall apply to all

water or floods levee maintenance will be thorough and continuous this requires a balanced maintenance program based on defined standards and procedures 3 maintenance standards and procedures the levees will be maintained as necessary to insure serviceability against floods at all times a sod growth maintenance of a sturdy sod growth on levee embankments is highly important as sod is one of the most effective means of protecting the levee against erosion from rain current and wave wash periodic mowing with tractor operated equipment is essential to maintaining a good sod growth and should be done at such intervals as necessary to keep down weeds and other noxious growth and to prevent the grass heights from exceeding twelve inches 12 the grass should be mowed to a height of two inches 2 or more the number of mowings required each season will depend on local conditions the last mowing of the season will be accomplished under conditions which will allow the grass to obtain a height of approximately eight inches 8 to ten inches 10 going into the winter season mowing will be performed to a distance of at least five feet 5 beyond the toe of the levee or berm burning grass and weeds will not be permitted in the levee maintenance program spraying with herbicides as needed during the growing season is permissible and desirable for weed and brush control on the levee and berms reseeding and fertilizing is to be at the rate necessary to sustain sod growth and levee embankments for control of erosion b earth embankments levee embankments will be maintained to not less than the design grade and section by replacing any loss of material from the crown or slopes ruts washes slides and subsidences should be properly repaired and the entire embankment maintained sufficiently smooth for power mowing levee crowns should be graded as necessary to drain freely and prevent impoundment of rain water all brush trees and other undesirable wild growth will be removed from the levee embankment c animal burrows levees and adjacent landward areas will be maintained free from all types of animal burrows animal burrows when found will be backfilled with compacted material and sodded to prevent reoccurrences efforts will be made to exterminate the burrowing animals d prevention of encroachment care will be taken to assure that the levees are not encroached upon buildings structures and storage of miscellaneous materials or equipment will not be permitted on the levee refuse dumps are an item of frequent concern and will not be permitted following each high water any dirt or debris which has been deposited on the riverside slope of the levee will be removed promptly e roads and ramps access roads to and on levees including ramps will be bladed as necessary to keep the roadway shaped properly and free of ruts pockets and washes ramp embankments should be maintained to their design section and design grade maintenance as necessary will be performed to correct any encroachment into the levee crown where roads cross levees road surfacing material will be replaced as necessary to maintain the road surface in good condition f miscellaneous levee facilities and appurtenances miscellaneous levee facilities and appurtenances which are constructed on over or levee will be maintained in a good state of repair andor in good operating condition the condition of these facilities will be inspected at least annually and those items which are operative only during high river stages will be checked carefully and repaired as necessary immediately prior to the high water season relief walls should be checked during periods of high water wells which do not flow for an extended period of time may have to be tested by pumping to determine the extent of deterioration where wells are found to be critically deteriorated they will be rehabilitated by cleaning surging and pumping check valves will be inspected to insure that they open freely and that gaskets are in good condition the most common of these facilities and appurtenances referred to herein are 1 drainage structures levee  2 toe drainage systems  3 relief walls  4 levee slope protection and protection on dike ends  5 gates cattle guards and fences  6 siphons and pipe crossings 4 inspection frequent inspections are essential to a good levee maintenance program
