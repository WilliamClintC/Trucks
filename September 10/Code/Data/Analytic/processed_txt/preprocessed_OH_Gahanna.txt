conduct that includes either a voluntary act or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is capable of performing  2 the person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the offense b when the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense the fact that one subsection of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability c 1 when language defining an element of an offense that is related to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability the element of the offense is established only if a person acts recklessly 2 c1 of this section does not apply to offenses defined in the traffic 3 c1 of this section does not relieve the prosecution of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition

possessed or was aware of the possessors control of the thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession 2 reflexes convulsions body movements during unconsciousness or sleep and body

offenders specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature b a person acts knowingly regardless of purpose when the person is aware that the persons conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature a person has knowledge of circumstances when the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist when knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact c a person acts recklessly when with heedless indifference to the consequences the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the persons conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature a person is reckless with respect to circumstances when with heedless indifference to the consequences the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist d a person acts negligently when because of a substantial lapse from due care the person fails to perceive

weighed with great caution it is for you as jurors in the light of all the facts presented to you from the witness stand to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and worth or its lack of quality and worth e it is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense the actor terminated his complicity under

rod a purpose this chapter provides for flexible residential development housing within the city the purpose of these regulations is to achieve 1 a variation of residential lot sizes without

savings utilities and streets  and 3 a development pattern which shall preserve maintain and effectively utilize significant open space and environmental resources such as wooded areas ravines streams

shall be utilized where surrounding land uses topography or other physical characteristics of the subject property are such that this development shall produce a superior living environment or shall promote the preservation of significant environmental resources which would not otherwise be preserved by the underlying zoning classification it is specifically not the intent of these regulations to

as noise odor debris and other similar characteristics of land use and that if not regulated can become a nuisance to adjacent properties or the community in general or depreciate the value of other properties within the community to mitigate the potential negative consequences reasonable limitations on signs are appropriate with respect to the size height and construction of signs and the time place and manner of their display b specifically the city has determined that regulations for signs are desirable in order to 1 prevent or limit traffic or pedestrian accidents injuries deaths and

rate or volume shall control the discharge rate of runoff prior to its release to offsite land the purposes of this policy are to 1 permit development without increasing the flooding potential of other lands  2 reduce damage to receiving streams and impairment of their capacity which may be caused by increases in the quantity and rate of stormwater discharge  and 3 establish a basis for design of stormwater drainage systems on lands below undeveloped areas which shall preserve the rights and options of both dominant and servient property owners and assure longterm adequacy of storm drainage systems b the stormwater runoff policy applies to all land developments not specifically exempted under or granted a waiver as provided by c other sections of this chapter specify the performance requirements of onsite drainage systems and runoff control standards passed 2110 119304  exemptions exemptions are appropriate for certain land use activities which clearly do not generate significant increases in stormwater runoff where exemptions are granted under this section they shall apply to the requirements for runoff control only and do not in any way imply a relaxation of requirements for adequate and proper onsite drainage or the ability of the system to accept runoff from the tributary land nor a relaxation of any other local state or federal requirements the following land uses and developments are exempted from stormwater runoff controls a land preparation for active agricultural areas orchards sod farms and nursery operations  b land grading or leveling for erosion control under direction of the local soil conservation district  c land located within the regulatory flood hazard area established under when developed for permitted or conditional uses defined under 15 passed 2110 119305  waivers a it is conceivable that development situations not automatically subject to exemptions under may exist such that development shall have none of the harmful effects associated with increases in runoff rates and volume such developments are eligible for a waiver the waiver applies only to the requirement that runoff be controlled and does not in any way imply a relaxation in the requirement for adequate onsite drainage or the ability to accept runoff from land tributary to the development b the waiver application shall request in writing that such requirements for stormwater runoff control be waived the application shall include sufficient detail to determine that granting a waiver shall not result in increased flooding and that the added volume of runoff shall not damage the receiving stream c a condition of the waiver shall be that any addition extension or modification of a development for which a waiver has been granted shall be required to provide stormwater runoff control for the entire site if preceding limitations are exceeded by subsequent additions extensions or modifications d the following land uses and developments are eligible to apply for a waiver on stormwater runoff control requirements contained in this chapter 1 development areas abutting and tributary to big walnut creek on which surface watershed flows directly into big walnut creek e all waiver applications shall be recommended by the city engineer and the planning commission and approved by council f in no case shall a waiver eliminate or replace any other local state or federal permit or compliance requirements passed 2110 119306  stormwater runoff control criteria a stormwater runoff control shall address both peak rate of runoff and total volume of runoff the peak rate of runoff from an area after development shall not exceed the peak rate of runoff from the same area before development for all return period storms from one year up to a 100year return period  24hour storm in addition if it is found a proposed development shall increase the volume of runoff from an area the peak rate of runoff from certain more frequent storms shall be controlled further there are two reasons why increases in volume of runoff require a peak runoff control standard more restrictive than controlling to the predevelopment condition first increases in volume mean runoff will be flowing for a longer period of time when routed watershed these longer flows may join at some point or points downstream creating new peak flows and create flooding and erosion and problems associated with increased peak flow this is known as the routing problem second longer flow periods of large runoff quantities place a highly erosive stress on natural channels this stress may be minimized by reducing the rate of discharge the permissible peak rates shall be determined as follows 1 determine the total volume of runoff from a oneyear return period 24hour storm occurring over the area before and after development  and 2 using tr55 methodology or other volume based methodology acceptable to the city engineer the rational method is not acceptable determine the percentage of increase in volume due to development and using this percentage pick the critical storm from the following table if the percentage of increase in volume of runoff is equal to or greater than and less than the critical storm fordischarge limitations shall be years  10 1 10 20 2 20 50 5 50 100 10 100 250 25 250 500 50 500  100 b the peak rate of runoff from the critical storm occurring over the development shall not exceed the peak rate of runoff from a oneyear return period storm occurring over the same area under predevelopment conditions storms of less frequent occurrence longer return period than the critical storm shall have a peak rate of runoff not greater than the same storm under predevelopment conditions as an example if the total volume is to be increased by 35 percent the critical storm is a fiveyear storm the peak rate of runoff for all storms up to this intensity shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak rate of runoff from a oneyear return period storm under predevelopment conditions in the area the runoff from a more intense storm up to a 100year return period storm must be controlled so as not to exceed the predevelopment peak rate from the same return period storm c appropriate stormwater runoff control addresses both peak rate and total volume of runoff in addition to peak rates of stormwater runoff methods for minimizing post construction increases in stormwater runoff volumes are strongly encouraged methods for reducing runoff volumes may include those listed below 1 retarding flow velocities by increasing friction  for example grassed road ditches rather than paved street gutters where practical  discharging roof water into vegetated areas  or grass and rock lined drainage channels  2 grading and construction of terraces and diversions to slow runoff and use of grade stabilization structures to provide a level of control in flow paths and stream gradients  3 induced infiltration of terraces and diversions to slow runoff and use of grade stabilization structures to provide a level of control in flow paths and stream gradients  4 provisions for retention and detention  for example permanent ponds and lakes with stormwater basins provided with proper drainage multiple use areas for stormwater detention and recreation wildlife transportation fire protection aesthetics or subsurface storage areas 5 other methods for controlling post construction water quality as approved by the city engineer 6 attenuation of runoff rates from upstream areas is not required to be provided flow from such areas will be routed drainage system in the development under consideration at a rate determined in the same manner as the onsite system anticipated future development however

accepted as adequate for determining peak runoff rates for drainage areas usgs methodologies are also acceptable other methods may be accepted with the concurrence of the city engineer the total watershed that produces stormwater runoff across the site proposed to be developed shall be included when estimating flood discharge runoff dependent on watershed size the following principal methods shall be considered acceptable to estimate design discharge 1 for small watersheds of 25 acres or less the design runoff may be determined by the rational method this method may also be used for catch basin hydrology the rational method shall not be used for sizing attenuation basins or any other facility that requires estimation of runoff volumes 2 for five100 acres of an urbanizing watershed the design runoff may be estimated by using the method as published urban hydrology for small watersheds tr55 this method may be applicable to areas up to 300 acres depending upon the topography tr20 and hec1 may be acceptable for larger areas the designer is encouraged to meet with the city drainage engineer prior to selecting a methodology for large watershed 3 other method approved by the city

environmentally sensitive areas within the development will be a major consideration and effective landscaping practices should be considered a topography areas of development that have significant topographic features such as ravines lakes ponds rivers streams creeks wetlands or woodlands should be preserved to maintain the natural environment within the development refer to preservation zones of the codified ordinances b aesthetics aesthetic as well as environmental concerns should be addressed to increase and diversify the tax base and preserve the intrinsic value of the area and neighboring properties 1 vegetation generous use of native vegetation such as shade trees and shrubbery is encouraged to promote the rural environment that presently defines the city 2 natural elements whenever possible screening should be of natural elements such as mounding and vegetation  fences should be avoided 3 open space open space and diverse arrangements of landscaping are issues that should be explored to maintain the rural residential character of the community 4 signage signage shall be as low profile as possible and shall be in conformance with neighboring properties andor uses c screening effective use of natural devices should be employed to minimize the environmental impact of high density multifamily dwelling units and to create a subtle land use transition trees

protect the unique attributes of the natural environment from runoff and other externalities associated with high density living conditions 3 building materials the visual effect of the development should complement the surrounding structures colors setting styles and other physical issues should be addressed to ensure responsible development practices protecting property conditions and values creates a higher quality of life and a more valuable tax base for the city a colors colors should be of a specific palette that fosters a harmonious relationship with other land uses and structures in the vicinity of the multifamily development 1 type natural historic earthtones or similar colors would be least likely to contrast with the existing color scheme 2 aesthetics consideration should be given to the color of existing and surrounding structures and developments b materials materials should be of the nature that will enhance the development and existing land values bricks slate wood

landscape islands islands of landscape grass trees shrubs etc shall be in the center and at the perimeter of the commercial development parking areas see of the codified ordinances for interior landscaping requirements 2 screening focusing on conflicting land uses and the externalities that are created should be minimized with screening efforts by the developer of the commercial development a natural elements earth mounding and trees should be considered to reduce neighborhood noise that is created by the commercial developments b other devices other screening devices may be necessary to protect adjacent property values depending on the developments secondary impacts and should be evaluated by the planning commission on a casebycase basis c vegetation generous use of vegetation should be encouraged to produce a natural atmosphere and create a subtle transition of land uses of varying intensities 3 landscape materials should be indigenous to the climate of central ohio and visually separate land uses of conflicting intensities visual interest and aesthetic enhancement of the development and its relationship to surrounding properties should be examined to ensure that the landscaping is appropriate for the development variety size spacing color and the geographic orientation should be considered during the evaluation to determine the effect on the commercial site 4 building materials the visual impact of commercial structures and developments is an issue that requires local government to retain some control over the type and style of individual developments a materials brick stone cement decorative aluminum wood or other materials that will enhance the development in a positive manner and create visual interest and diversity should be encouraged b colors specific colors and color schemes should be designed to ensure universal harmony on all commercial developments 1 quality durability and other structural considerations should be given to building materials to ensure that development is of high quality 2 aesthetics orientation of the development should focus on and compliment the surrounding topographic features and existing developments a the

illuminate the parking area of the office commerce and technology facility should be of decorative nature to ensure visual interest as well as compliance with lighting requirements metal halide lighting shall be encouraged 3 access the office commerce and technology facility should be limited in number of accesses but well defined to all traffic use of decorative directional signage should be utilized to minimize problems with vehicular traffic 4 location the planning commission should be concerned with the location of the proposed parking area and the screening design that will minimize visual contact with the general public parking areas should be behind the office commerce and technology facility 2 landscaping and screening integration of natural screening elements should be used to maximize visual interest and foster a natural relationship between the development and the land see of the codified ordinances a existing landscaping the use of large existing trees such as pines oaks and maples for landscaping and screening requirements is encouraged these types of materials should also assist in defining the circulation pattern within the manufacturing development b aesthetics ponds or other waterways are encouraged in office commerce and technology developments to promote aesthetic qualities that otherwise may not be present in the development minimizing externalities such as noise pollution and refuse that are associated with manufacturing processes should be accomplished to preserve land values and to maintain the aesthetics of the city more aggressive measures may be required to protect the natural environment from manufacturing facilities the piping of natural watercourses shall be discouraged 3 building materials the relationship between the structure and the land is most often defined by the materials used in the development in order to protect land values of adjoining parcels explicit materials colors styles etc should be established to control development however since most of this development will occur in the office commerce and technology district a more liberal standard may be used to control development a bricks the types and colors of bricks should be chosen to ensure a harmonious relationship between developments and the environment industrial type materials will need to be gathered for this purpose examples should be gathered from brick manufacturers and brick distributors in central ohio so there is a diverse range of materials for structural design b walls stone or cement walls that will enhance the design of the area will be encouraged in developments that have large structures c roofing roofing styles which encourage diversity by use of varying angles and peaks is one issue that should be addressed to provide an interesting aesthetic orientation to the development eco friendly roofs are encouraged d windows and entryways large windows are encouraged in areas where manufacturing processes will allow them entryways into the office and reception areas should enhance the visual interest of the development as well as provide direction to visitor areas e screening the screening of mechanics andor equipment shall be in accordance with of the codified ordinances f signage signage shall be as low profile as possible and shall be in conformance with neighboring properties andor uses e planned districts drd5 since the planning commission has control of the commercial developments in planned districts the general commercial requirements outlined for drd3 will apply to most developments however the planning commission may wish to concentrate on demanding more open space and buffer zones between differing land uses these design attributes should be evaluated by the planning commission on a casebycase basis f residential districts with conditional uses drd6 1 parking other than of the codified ordinances a screening parking areas for conditional uses should be screened with dense vegetation to minimize visual externalities that may degrade the residential nature of the area internal landscaping should be determined on a casebycase basis 1 traffic patterns circulation patterns should be established by the use of directional arrows vegetation directional signs or other acceptable means 2 access sidewalks to the residential area from the conditional use should be established to incorporate the development into the neighborhood the pedestrian access should include landscape on the site of development and add to the character of the development 2 landscape sufficient use of diverse vegetation should incorporate the existing topographic features and the existing residential neighborhood trees shrubs and earth mounds are encouraged to add aesthetic value to the existing communitys identity a preservation of existing natural element preserving mature foliage and other natural features of the site should be encouraged large trees and unique features will add intrinsic value to the development and community in general b aesthetics distance color and the general landscape orientation of the conditional use should focus primarily on the relationship of the neighborhood and residences diversity is encouraged provided that it does not degrade the residential area or environment vegetation that is indigenous to central ohio is encouraged 3 building materials considering the close proximity of conditional uses in residential areas it is important that the materials used in these types of developments conform to or at least compliment the surrounding community 4 signage signage shall be as low profile as possible and shall be in conformance with neighboring properties andor uses passed 121911  exh a 4317 119710
