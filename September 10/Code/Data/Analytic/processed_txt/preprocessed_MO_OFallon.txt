necessary in cases where a traffic study is not warranted the city engineer can determine the extent of the reduced roadway or sidewalk crosssection improvements to be used for the purpose of being consistent as the city approves developments in the downtown area and on specific streets within the downtown area the city will develop a pattern of the approved roadway and sidewalk cross sections and these will provide a template for future projects the engineering division shall collect and maintain a library of the roadway and sidewalk cross sections that get approved on projects within this district l detention requirements if it is proven that a detention basin cannot be accommodated on the site stormwater facilities as described in the regulations outlined in d2 of the subdivision be required m architectural site design and signage guidelines the following guidelines are considered voluntary and not a requirement please note that if a guideline is chosen to be followed there are standards provided herein that will need to be followed fallon city code  sign guidelines a setbacks can be reduced in circumstances where the minimum setbacks cannot be met sight triangle and sight distance requirements shall not be modified b projecting signs are allowed if projecting into the city rightofway a license agreement would be required c the citys sign further sign requirements as outlined in of the municipal building placement guidelines a locate buildings close to the street within twentyfive 25 feet of the curb with offstreet parking behind andor beside buildings b if the building is located at a street intersection place the main building or part of the building at the corner parking loading or service should not be located at an intersection without review and approval of the planning and zoning commission c to maximize the street frontage of buildings and minimize the street frontage of parking lots buildings should be articulated so that the long side fronts on the street 3 outdoor lighting guidelines a use low intensity of highquality white light which will provide good uniform visibility while avoiding light pollutions b cutoff fixtures are preferred because they are more efficient than noncutoff fixtures at casting light on the sidewalk and avoiding light spillage and pollution c use decorative bases posts luminaries and bollards in lieu of standard wood poles d a lighting program should consider the illumination of sidewalks and other multiuse pathways using lowintensity fixtures that provide an even distribution of light while avoiding areas of intense shadows e to consolidate the number of fixtures placed within the rightof way consider the colocation of light fixtures along with other streetscape elements on single poles ie street lighting pedestrian lighting and banners f a substantial amount of lighting for pedestrians should be provided from the storefronts using either indirect illumination from within the building or direct illumination under canopies or awnings provisions  site landscaping guidelines the corners of street intersections particularly gateways and site entries entries from both street and sidewalk should be distinguished by special landscape treatments flower displays specimen trees and shrubs accent rocks low walls signage decorative lighting sculpture architectural elements andor special paving features for vehicular entry points must meet the citys sight triangle requirements 5 vehicular circulation guidelines a whenever possible internal access drives should be located to join together existing public streets andor connect to adjacent private drives so that the internal circulation functions as an integral part of the surrounding transportation network b provide at least one 1 vehicular link to each abutting property to the extent practical this is most often accomplished by joining adjacent parking lots if the lot is undeveloped or underdeveloped provide at an appropriate grade part of the connection or maintain the potential for a future link c minimize or eliminate curb cuts along a public street where possible share vehicular access with adjacent properties and or utilize alleys for access 6 automobile parking guidelines a parking lots should be located behind buildings or in the interior of a block whenever possible parking lots should not occupy more than onethird 13 of the frontage of the adjacent building or no more than sixtyfour 64 feet whichever is less b shared parking is strongly encouraged between adjacent or vertically mixed uses whose peak demand is offset from each other eg office and housing c large surface parking lots larger than seventyfive thousand 75000 square feet of vehicular surface should be visually and functionally segmented into several smaller lots enclosed by landscaping d parking lots along the street must be screened from the adjacent street and sidewalk by walls fences or landscaping 7 general street and sidewalk design principle guidelines a streets should be designed with street trees planted in a manner appropriate to their function commercial streets should have trees which complement the face of the buildings and which shade the sidewalk residential streets should provide for an appropriate canopy which shades both the street and sidewalk and serves as a visual buffer between the fallon city code street and the home the typical width of the street tree landscape strip is six 6  eight 8 feet this width ensures healthy street trees precludes tree roots from heaving the sidewalk and provides adequate pedestrian buffering b trees may be planted in tree wells with grates over the top to protect the roots irrigation should be provided large canopy trees such as oaks and maples should be planted a minimum of thirty 30 feet on center unit pavers are preferred over concrete where no onstreet parking exists all street trees shall be set back from the edge of the curb a minimum of four 4 feet 8 general building design guidelines a new buildings should strive for a contextual approach to design a contextual design approach is not intended to necessarily mean a historic approach but rather one that is sensitive to the surrounding urban built and natural conditions b adjacent buildings should relate in similarity of scale height and configuration 9 facade treatment guidelines a the primary entrance shall be both architecturally and functionally designed on the front facade of the building facing the primary public street such entrances shall be designed to convey their prominence on the fronting facade b buildings at street corners should be designed to address the corner that is to engage the interest of drivers pedestrians and bicyclists at the intersection provide a building entry additional building mass and distinctive architectural elements at the corner c use building massing special architectural features signage and changes in the roofline to emphasize building entrances d the ground level of the building must offer pedestrian interest along sidewalks and paths this includes windows entrances and architectural details signage awnings benches and ornamentation are encouraged e canopies and awnings should be canvas or similar material and may be permitted to encroach over a sidewalk to within two 2 feet of a public street

definition the term planned development refers to a specific parcel of land or several contiguous parcels of land under common ownership or control which when designed in accordance with this approved by the city council allow for the development of residential commercial office hightech or industrial land by means of an alternate more flexible method than would be permitted utilizing the citys conventional zoning subdivision and land development a proposed planned development will only be reviewed if it is determined to meet the qualifying objectives to the satisfaction of the city council of one 1 of the three 3 types of permitted planned developments outlined below under no circumstances will a planned development be permitted when the same development objectives can be accomplished utilizing the citys conventional zoning subdivision and land development b purpose a planned development permitted in accordance with this be considered as an alternative method for the development of land under special circumstances described herein and only upon terms agreeable to the city council because of this alternative method of development special design standards are hereby established to govern and guide the creation of a planned development to enable thorough analysis of a planned development more information is demanded about the proposed development than would be required if the development were being proposed under the citys conventional zoning subdivision and land development therefore all proposed planned developments must undergo a twostage area plan and final plan review process the planning and zoning commission and city council per the requirements of this should be clearly understood that the review and approval of a planned development is a privilege to be earned based on the design of the project in full compliance with this decision to approve a proposed planned development shall be at the sole discretion of the city council c planned development designation with the exception of the zoning districts listed below the city council may attach the designation of planned development to land within any of the citys residential commercial hightech or industrial zoning districts in conjunction with the approval of an area plan per the requirements of this exceptions to the planned development designation under no circumstances shall the planned development designation be attached to the citys r5 mobile home park district ag agricultural district pr parkrecreation district tg transitional growth provisions of planned developments and the qualifying objectives ro 2007    district or the senior community overlay district in addition the planned development designation shall only be attached to the citys r3 garden apartment district and r4 apartment house district if multifamily housing is proposed either rental or owneroccupied the planned development designation shall not be attached to the citys mutdd mixeduse traditional development district however proposed developments utilizing the citys mutdd mixeduse traditional development zoning district must undergo the same twostage area plan and final plan review process the planning and zoning commission and city council per the requirements of this types of planned developments and the qualifying objectives the city council shall only attach the planned development designation to a site and subsequently approve a planned development if it is determined to meet the qualifying objectives to the satisfaction of the council of one 1 of the three 3 types of permitted planned developments outlined below 1 environmental protection planned developments a proposed environmental protection planned development is for a residential commercial office hightech or industrial site that must to the satisfaction of the city council provide for the permanent protection and preservation of the natural features and environmentally sensitive areas of the site a qualifying objectives the qualifying objectives for permitting the review of a proposed environmental protection planned development is to encourage the permanent protection of the environmentally sensitive areas of a site while still allowing for the sites development by concentrating development away from these environmentally sensitive areas in order to accomplish the separation of the environmentally sensitive areas from the areas of the site suitable for development limited departure from strict conformance to the underlying zoning district regulations andor subdivision and land development may be permitted by the city council in accordance with the allowances of this redevelopment planned developments a proposed redevelopment planned development is for residential commercial office hightech or industrial development at a specific site or location within the city that as determined by the city council is in a state of decline andor in need of redevelopment a qualifying objectives the qualifying objectives for permitting the review of a proposed redevelopment planned development fallon city code is to provide an incentive for the development community to develop at these specific sites or locations the incentive provided to the developer would be permitted flexibility of the design of the site by allowing for limited departure from strict conformance to the underlying zoning district regulations andor subdivision and land development per the allowances of this allowing for the limited departure from strict conformance to these regulations proposed developments that may not otherwise be financially feasible may become attractive to the development community although many proposed developments of this nature will instead be encouraged to utilize the citys mutdd mixeduse traditional development zoning district classification which must follow the same twostage area plan and final plan review and approval process outlined in this  there may be instances where proposed developments cannot meet the required size andor required mix of residential and nonresidential uses necessary to utilize the city mutdd zoning classification 3 special exception planned developments a proposed special exception planned development is for a commercial office hightech or industrial site that due to its irregular shape and size would necessitate the need for variances from the citys zoning or subdivision and land development the board of adjustment after the initial approval of the proposed development by the planning and zoning commission a qualifying objectives the qualifying objectives for permitting the review of a proposed special exception planned development is to allow for both the planning and zoning commission and city council to comprehensively review the proposed development in its entirety without the involvement of the board of adjustment per the required twostage area plan and final plan requirements of this variances needed for the proposed development would instead be reviewed as the proposed modifications to the underlying zoning district regulations andor subdivision and land development per the allowances of this would no longer place the burden upon the planning and zoning commission of having to decide whether a proposed development should be approved contingent upon receiving variances board of adjustment this would also no longer place the burden upon the board of adjustment of having to decide whether or not to grant the requested variances on a proposed development that they have limited familiarity with that was approved by the planning and zoning commission contingent upon receiving the variances provisions standards ro 2007    a size requirements there shall be no minimum or maximum size requirement for a site to be developed as a planned development b permitted modifications to the zoning district regulations upon approval by the city council a planned development may depart from strict conformance to certain underlying zoning district regulations to which the planned development designation has been attached the departure from strict conformance to these underlying zoning district regulations shall only be permitted if deemed necessary for the proper design of the planned development proposed modifications to the underlying zoning district regulations are limited to one 1 or more of the following 1 reduction of the minimum lot area requirements 2 reduction of the minimum lot width requirements 3 reduction of the minimum lot depth requirements 4 reduction of the front yard setback requirements 5

modifications to the subdivision and land development upon approval by the city council a planned development may depart from strict conformance to certain regulations of the subdivision and land development departure from strict conformance to these subdivision and land development shall only be permitted if deemed necessary for the proper design of the planned development proposed modifications to the subdivision and land development limited to one 1 or more of the following 1 reduction of the minimum rightofway requirements for minor residential and culdesac streets 2 reduction of the minimum centerline radii for minor residential and culdesac streets fallon city code  reduction of the minimum corner radii at the back of curb for minor residential and culdesac streets 4 reduction of the minimum block length 5 increase in the maximum block length 6 increase in the maximum length of culdesacs 7 modification to the requirements for private alleys 8 modification to the requirements for sidewalks 9 modification to the requirements for street tree placement d regulations which may not be modified a planned development must meet the use and density limitations of the underlying zoning district in which the development is to be located all requirements of the underlying zoning district and the subdivision and land development applicable except as specifically modified pursuant to the allowance of this approved by the city council under no circumstances shall the applicable flood hazard prevention requirements stormwater detention requirements

air and water pollution noise odor fire hazard etc be modified in conjunction with the approval of a planned development in addition all other city county state and federal regulations and development requirements shall apply to the planned development e residential density under no circumstances shall the residential density of a planned development exceed that which would normally be permitted in the underlying residential zoning district to which the planned development designation has been attached 1 calculation of density the computation of residential density shall be based on the dwelling units per net acreage of the residentially zoned portion of the site net acreage is determined by subtracting the area devoted to public street rightsofway private alleys and dry detention basins from the gross acreage of the residentially zoned portion of the site to compute residential density the net acreage of the residentially zoned portion of the site shall be divided by the smallest minimum lot size allowed in the underlying residential zoning district to which the planned development designation has been attached in situations where a planned development designation is attached to two 2 or more underlying residential zoning districts the residential density shall be calculated separately for each of the underlying residential zoning district to which the planned development designation has been attached provisions f permanent protection of environmentally sensitive areas all environmental protection planned developments shall to the satisfaction of the city council be

width requirements for bufferyards on lots developed after  one 1 of the most important functions of the zoning the separation of land uses into districts which have similar character and contain compatible uses the location of districts is supposed to provide protection but in the city of ofallon this is not the case since zoning districts permitting uses as diverse as singlefamily residential and industrial use were located adjacent to each other long before  bufferyards will operate to minimize the negative impact of any future use on its neighboring uses provisions b required

other remedies available under any applicable federal state or local law and it is within the discretion of the city to seek cumulative remedies a purpose and intent two 2 consequences of construction and development are increased runoff created by the changed properties of ground surface and the rate of discharge of this increased runoff these are both of great relevance to stormwater the natural condition of the land before development is in relative balance with the natural capacity of the receiving creeks normally the undeveloped conditions provide greater permeability and longer times of concentration by modification of the ground surface from the irregular pervious and vegetationcovered the areas are changed to more impervious more quickly drained and in some cases denuded of vegetation it is the policy of the city to protect and promote the public health safety and general welfare the management of stormwater will reduce the erosion on land and creek channels will reduce the possibility of damage to public and private property and will assist in the attainment and maintenance of water quality standards and will preserve the environmental quality of the watercourses in the city b requirements  creek bank setback 1 development along natural watercourses shall have residential lot lines commercial or industrial improvements parking areas and driveways set back a

to offset such adverse effects mitigation may include but not be limited to the following a installing additional erosion and sediment control  b if the stream has the potential for lateral movement installing stream stabilization practices within the stream  c for those sites where vegetation does not exist establishing vegetation  andor d additional tree planting c postconstruction  water quality in order to preserve the quality of water in natural streams it is important to provide a mechanism to remove contaminants on the site prior to water entering the natural watercourse typically called postconstruction bmps best management practices these methods identify a critical water quality volume that will need to receive a treatment to remove certain contaminants these improvements whether structural or nonstructural will remain in place after the construction is completed the concepts introduced in the following subsections are taken from the georgia stormwater management manual volume 2 august 2001 fallon city code nothing in the following subsections shall change or replace any of the citys detention ordinances 1 water quality volume wqv a the water quality volume denoted as the wqv is the storage needed to capture and treat the runoff from ninety percent 90% of the recorded daily rainfall events in numerical terms it is equivalent to one and fourteen
