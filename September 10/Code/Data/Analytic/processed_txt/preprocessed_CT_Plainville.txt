wetlands and watercourses act wetlands and uplands an introduction the relationship between a wetland or waterc9urse and its surrounding upland is complex upland land clearing excavating filling and other construction activities if not properly planned and executed can have significant impacts on adjacent wetlands and watercourses under the inland wetlands and watercourses act the municipal wetlands agency has broad authority to issue permits not only for activities in wetlands or watercourses themselves but for activities located elsewhere when such activities are likely to impact or affect wetlands or watercourses it is the departments policy to encourage municipal wetland agencies to review proposed aci~vittes located in upland areas suttotmding wetlands and watercourses wherever such activities ate likely to impact or affect wetlands or watercourses1 an understanding of how certain activities in upland areas affect wetlands and watercourses has led most towns to adopt regulations requiring wetland agency review of proposed development adjacent to wetlands and watercourses2 such regulations are optional under the act but serve to inform the public as to the circumstances under which a wetlands permit is required of activities proposed adjacent to a wetland or watercourse while requiring a permit for specified activities within defined upland review area boundatqes these wetland a~encies still maintain their authori ty to regulate proposed activities located in more distant upland areas if they find that the activities are likely to impact or affect a wetland or watercourse the purpose of these guidelines is to assist municipal wetlands agencies to review and revise their wetlands and watercourses regulations if necessary as such the guidelines provide a foundation for consistency in municipal regulations and permitting activities they are not intended to substitute for reasoned evaluation and judgement by municipal wetlands agencies of the local wetland and watercourse resources the conditions surrounding those resources and the types of activities which are likely to impact or affect those resources nor are they intended to guide wetlands agencies decision making process for acting on permits both these topics are more appropriately addressed in detail departments inland wetlands management training program for wetland agency commissioners and their staff wetlands agencies are reminded that they should review proposed changes in their inland wetlands and watercourses regulations with their town attorney bureau of water management iwrdwmguidereview  june 1997 model municipal upland review area regulations in addition to implementing the law to protect wetlands and watercourses regulations inform the public on what to expect if one proposes an activity in or affecting a wetland or watercourse in the subject town upland review area regulations reduce or eliminate the need for casebycase rulings by providing notice as to what activities need wetland permits by specifying where a permit is required such regulations foster consistency and are convenient for the public in determining the boundaries for its upland review area regulations the wetland agency should consider the specific kinds of development activities on uplands which are likely to impact or affect wetlands and watercourses and the nature of that impact or affect an upland activity which is likely to impact or affect wetlands or watercourses is a regulated activity and should be identified as such in the regulations in identifying upland review area regulated activities the wetlands agency must apply the standard established under section 22a 42af of the general statutes and find that the activity is  likely to impact or affect wetlands or watercourses4 examples of upland regulated activities are included in the models below in implementing its upland review area regulations the wetland agency must be cognizant that certain proposed activities which are permitted uses as of right or as nonregulated uses under section 22a40 of the general statutes are not regulated and do not require a permit from the wetlands agency under the inland wetlands and watercourses act there are a number of ways that the boundaries of an upland review area may be defined in regulations in selecting its approach the wetland agency should consider the special nature of their towns wetland and watercourse resources the purposes and intent of the inland wetlands and watercourses act and how the regulations will be implemented three models for upland review area regulations are presented below the first model provides that certain specified activities if conducted within a specified distance measured from any wetland or watercourse are regulated activities as such the first model is the basic model and easiest to implement the second model expands upon that basic model by identifying specific wetland and watercourse resources of special concern and providing site specific review area widths for those resources this model should be used where the wetland agency believes additional protection though a wider review area is needed or to take existing land development or uses into account with a narrower review area the third model adds to the basic model a slope and soil factor in determining the site specific width or location of the upland review area the first and second models are easily understood and implemented while the third is technically complex and not easily implemented without trained staff note that the first sentence of each model definition below is the definition of the term regulated act~vio~ taken from section 22a3813 of the inland wetlands and watercourses act and as such its meaning may not be changed in municipal inland wetlands regulations bureau of water management iwrdwmguidereview  june 1997 modei regulation optionss model regulated activity means any operation

watercourse any activity located in a nonwetland or nonwatercourse area ~vhich is likely to impact or affect a wetland or watercourse may be deemed to be a regulated activity unless the activity is a use permitted as of right or as a nonregulated activity however the likelihood of an activity having a substantive impact on a wetland or watercourse will depend on a number of factors including the nature of the wetland or watercourse the activity soils and slope of the land and would generally decrease with increasing distance of the activity from the wetland or watercourse at some point impacts from that activity on wetlands and watercourses would be expected to become de minimis and not measurable the dep believes that a 100 foot~vide upland review area is sufficient for reviewing construction bureau of water management iwrdwmgudereview  june 1997 activities in areas surrounding wetlands or watercourses because most of the activities which are likely to impact or affect these resources will be located in that area however based on the special factors of concern to a wetlands agency eg wetland and watercourse values slope soils existing development etc a greater or lesser distance may be appropriate for a particular municipality however beyond 100 feet it is neither practical nor desirable from a wetlands and watercourses management perspective to automatically require an inland wetlands permit for all construction activities it must be emphasized that other municipal authorities and mechanisms involving planning zoning and subdivision decisions and plans of conservation and development play a role in addressing the broader watershed issues upland review areas setbacks and buffers in a number of municipal inland wetlands regulations upland review areas are referred to as setbacks or buffers9 we chose the term upland review area to describe the nonwetland or nonwatercourse area in which certain activities would be regulated because it best conveys the regulatory scheme under the wetlands statutes wherein a wetland agency reviews regulated activities casebycase and approves or disapproves them on their merits the inland wetland statutes do not authorize a blanket prohibition of all activities either in the wetlands or in upland review buffer or setback areas use of upland review area reguhttions most municipal wetland agencies have already adopted some form of upland review area regulations such regulations are based on a presumption that the regulated activity will have an adverse impact on the adjacent wetland or watercourse a person proposing to conduct a regulated activity has the burden to demonstrate to the wetlands agency that the impacts of his proposal are consistent with the purposes and provisions of the inland wetlands and watercourses act and therefore that he is entitled to the permit an applicant who successfully documents to the satisfaction of the wetlands agency that his proposed activities are fully consistent with the purposes and provisions of the inland wetlands and watercourses act is entitled to receive a permit the factors the wetlands agency must consider in making its decision on the application are prescribed in section 22a41 of the general statutesn the role of the upland review area in protecting wetlands and waterconrses upland areas surrounding wetlands or watercourses function in a number of ways to protect these resources an understanding of these functions and how they potentially may be impacted by construction activity or development is necessary for the wetlands agency to adopt an upland review area and subsequently regulate activities therein since the functions will vary depending on the specific project site each permit application will be different and must be reviewed on its individual merits bureau of water management 1wrdwiviguidereview  june 1997 control nonpoint source pollution vegetation and natural soils foster removal of

within the same watershed and the multiplicity of regulated activities which may be involved in site development it is not practical to establish separate upland review area boundary distances for each category or type of regulated acttvity instead the upland review area should be of sufficient width to ensure that it will encompass the activities that are most likely to impact or affect the adjacent wetlands or watercourses it is recommended that upland review area boundaries be delineated using a uniform distance measured horizontally and perpendicular from the ordinary high water mark of a lake pond river or stream or from a wetland soil boundary the upland review area width adopted by the wetlands agency may be wider or narrower than the 100 foot width recommended by dep dep encourages municipal wetlands agencies base their upland review area widths giving due consideration to local landscape factors including the value or importance of wetland or watercourse resources extent of existing land use and ira wetland agency deems it to be practicable on the slope and soils of the land to be developed or other factors to be enforceable the upland review areas must be adopted in the towns inland wetlands and watercourses regulations following the procedures described under section 22a42a of the general statutes~2 importantly the upland review area regulations must be easy to understand by a property owner and easy to implement by the inland wetlands agency should it need to take an enforcement action as well as by any other interested person a uniform review area width has the advantage of simplicity over a variable width in that it is easier to delineate understand and administer the disadvantage of a variable nonunifurm width upland review area regulation is that its inherent complexity may make the regulation difficult to establish and subsequently administer ordinarily the agency will need a professional staff person to delineate and enforce variable upland review area regulations also citizens may be confused using a variable approach and disagreements over the actual location on the ground of the outer limit of the upland review area may complicate permit and enforcement proceedings verification of the upland review area location is particularly important in an enforcement action where the burden is on the agency to prove that there is a violation of its regulations for these reasons the department urges caution in adopting complex upland review area boundaries eg model option 1i above while it is desirable for upland review areas to be depicted on the towns official inland wetlands and watercourses map depending on the type of review area adopted actual mapping may not be necessary provided appropriate narrative description is included in the towns inland wetlands and watercourses regulations and such provisions are clearly referenced on the official map wetlands agency regulations governing wetlands maps and the official wetlands maps themselves should state that such wetlands and watercourses maps were prepared for information purposes only and that the actual character of the land shall govern the agencys jurisdiction thereon the bureau of water management iwrdwmgu1dereview  june 1997 official wetlands and watercourses maps should also clearly reference or depict all upland review areas which have been adopted by the agency boundary_ factors there are a number of factors which should be considered in defining upland review area boundaries for unique situations such as with an important bog the boundary of the review area could be set by using an elevation contour encompassing the subject area in addition upland review areas may be wider or narrower for specified wetlands or watercourses for example an upland review area for a significant wetland or watercourse habitat or for wetlands and watercourses located in a public water supply watershed could be set wider than a review area for wetlands or watercourses located in other less critical areas  significant wetland and watercourse resources all wetlands have intrinsic value some wetland areas being more or less ecologically valuable than others but ira wetland or watercourse is known to be ecologically significant or to have a critical function or value such as in flood control or as habitat for an endangered species a wider more protective upland review area may be appropriate unique wetland and watercourse values such as in research education or recreation may also warrant a wider upland review area dep encourages all towns to evaluate their wetlands resources to that end dep offers training guidance on a methodology for identifying the relative importance of the wetlands and watercourses in a town or within a watershed see dep bulletin # 9 method for the evaluation ofinland ivetlands in connecticut 1989 13  this methodology uses mathematical and word expressions to assign relative wetland value units wvu to a number of the common wetland and watercourse functions the following functions are defined in dep bulletin #9 flood control ecological integrity wildlife habitat fish habitat nutrient retention and sediment trapping education potential visualesthetic quality agricultural potential forestry potential water based recreation groundwater use potential shoreline anchoring and dissipation of

slope upward from the wetland or watercourse the wetland agency may have a better opportunity to protect wetlands and watercourses from sedimentation originating from upland construction activities for example wherever the minimum 100 foot upland review area slope exceeds 5% regulations could add 5 feet or other reasonable measure of review area distance hottzontally for each 1% increase in slope thus if the basic 100 foot wide review area has a 15% slope upward from the ordinary high water line or wetland soil boundary an additional 50 feet would be added to the horizontal width of the upland review area 5ftl% x 10%   50ft similarly where the land slopes away downward from the regulated area eg as in the case of a hiltside seep wetland the width of the review area could be reduced in general the greater the slope of the land being developed the greater the potential threat of damage to adjacent wetlands and watercourses from erosion and sedimentation however in practice unless a town already has good townwide topographic mapping calculating a slope parameter for a townwide map of the upland review area boundary would require considerable professional engineering expertise a practical approach to using the slope factor may be for wetland agencies to assert their jurisdiction casebycase over major construction activities on any steeply sloped areas located outside the upland review area where wetlands and watercourses may be threatened by sedimentation caused by erosion at upland construction sites such sedimentation is deemed to be pollution and may be cause for an enforcement action under the inland wetlands statutes see definition of regulated activity above  soils combined with slope the type of soil found adjacent to wetlands and watercourses is an important factor in how development may affect adjacent wetlands or watercourses soil characteristics such as texture cohesiveness and organic content influence the creation of rill and gully formation as a result of erosion by water in turn this creates a potential for sedimentation of adjacent wetlands and watercourses the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service has compiled lists of highly erodible soil map units which can be located using their published soil surveys while these lists were compiled primarily for agricultural applications they may also be useful in evaluating the erosion potential from construction activity bureau of water management iwrdwmgijidereview  june 1997 also the permeability of a particular soil the rate at which groundwater travels soil is an important consideration when evaluating the potential for an upland review area td renovate wastewater discharges to the ground water that may subsequently discharge to a wetland or watercourse this may be an important consideration when septic system leaching fields or storm water infiltration trenches are proposed adjacent to wetlands or watercourses for more information on highly erodible soils refer to highly erodible soilmap units of connecticut usdanrcs 1986 for more information on soil permeability characteristics contact your local usdanatural resource conservation service center call 8604874011 for the center near you information on groundwater as it relates to sewage treatment can be found in seepage and pollutant renovation dep bulletin # 7 and carrying capacity of public water supply watersheds dep bulletin # 11 except when soils are used to define wetlands regulation of development based on soil characteristics is largely a responsibility of the town sanitarian and the planning and zoning commissions4 however where highly erodible soils are located adjacent to wetlands and watercourses erosion and sedimentation control is especially critical and should also be addressed by the wetland agency upland review area boundaries based on soil characteristics should be depicted as such on the official inland wetlands and watercourses map for the subject town  floodplain limits the landward boundary of a mapped floodplain such as delineated by the 100year flood mapped by the national flood insurance program has been determined using a theoretical design flood on the subject watercourse mapped flood limits have no direct relation to the location of wetlands or smaller w~itercourses on the floodplain also the floodplain boundaries for most small watercourses have not been mapped for these reasons flood insurance floodplain maps may not reflect a reasonable boundary of the upland review area urban areas and existing development existing development of the area surrounding wetlands and watercourses has more likely than not already had an impact on the upland areas ability to protect those resources degraded conditions should not be used to justify further degradation the wetlands or watercourses themselves may have been filled or modified for storm water or flood control for these reasons any remaining fringe of undisturbed area between the wetland or watercourse and existing upland development may be all that there is to buffer adjacent water resources from further degradation from new development in such urban areas particular attention should be given to how storm ~vater discharges are managed so as to minimize the opportunity for pollution and alteration of wetland or watercourse habitats bureau of water management iavrdwviguidereview  june 1997 new development in urban areas that contain degraded wetlands or watercourses may provide an opportunity to improve these degraded resources while mitigating the impact of the new development this can be accomplished by habitat restoration or enhancement or by using storm water management system retrofits that are designed to improve the quality of the storm water discharge endnotes 1 this document was prepared in response to inquiries from municipal wetland commissioners the rivers advisory committee the regulated community and other interested persons for guidance on implementing setback and buffer provisions in municipal regulations adopted under connecticuts inland wetlands and watercourses act d of the general statutes directs the department to provide guidance for the implementation of af of the general statutes 2 over 80% of connecticuts municipal wetlands agencies have regulations governing regulated activities in areas surrounding wetlands or watercourses 3 ac2 of the general statutes provides that a wetlands agency may delegate approval authority for nonsignificant activities proposed in upland review areas to its agent provided such agent has had dep training 4 af provides that the ~vetlands agency has jurisdiction over those activities proposed in the upland review area which are _ likely to impact or affect wetlands or watercourses in documenting the necessity for regulating specific activities conducted in upland review areas it is not sufficient to merely assert that the activity may impact or affect wetlands or watercourses 5 contact dep for a copy of lnland wetlands and watercotnses model regulations deps model regulattons provide a comprehensive guide for

land caused by the presence and action of water which presence and action is so common and usual and so long continued in all ordinary years so as to mark upon the land a distinction between the abutting upland and the watercourse such mark may be found by examining the bed and bank of any watercourse and ascertaining thereon an abrupt change in the characteristics ofsoit or vegetation or slope of the land this term should be defined in municipal wetlands regulations 7 percent slope is most simply determined by dividing the difference in elevation between two points by the distance between the points ie riserun and multiplying the result by 100 ira slope factor is used in regulations the regulations must provide guidance as to how the slope should be measured in the field eg on shortest straight line transect from any wetland or watercourse boundary to the highest up gradient point on the land to be developed  number and location of transects  and in recognition that bureau of water management iwrdwviguidereview  june 1997 the actual slope of the land is not uniform methods for averaging of slope over a site 8 in implementing upland review area regulations the ~vetlands agency must be cognizant of the uses as of right provisions of section 22a40 of the general statutes under section 22a40 certain activities are uses of wetland and watercourses as of right or as a nonregulated use such uses are not regulated and do not require a permit from the wetland agency for example subdivision 4 of section 22a40a prescribes that certain  uses incidental to the enjoyment and maintenance of residential property are permitted as of right such uses shall include maintenance of existing structures and landscaping but shall not include removal or deposition of significant amounts of material from or onto a wetland or watercourse or diversion or alteration of a watercourse other uses permitted as of right include certain agricultural and forestry uses boat anchorage and mooring certain water company activities and maintenance of drainage pipes which predate the regulations nonregulated uses include a number of conservation and recreational activities persons proposing such uses should seek confirmation from the municipal wetlands agency that their proposed project does not require a permit 9 dep has not adopted an upland review area provision for state agency actions because unlike municipal wetland agencies which have only one opportunity to review a project dep has a number of opportunities during both planning and permitting of state agency projects dep reviews state agency projects under the environmental policy act findings of no significant impact environmental impact statements and several permit programs under title 22a and 25 of the general statutes as partners in state government state agencies generally act cooperatively to address environmental issues utilizing its technical resources the state strives to apply site specific best management practices during the different planing and regulatory reviews 10 depending on the wetland agency upland review area widths range from 25 feet up to 650 feet from wetland or watercourse boundaries 11 of the inland wetlands and watercourses act established the criteria for decision on permit applications as follows in carrying out the purposes and policies of sections 22a36 to 22a45 inclusive of the connecticut general statutes including matters relating to regulating licensing and enforcing of the provisions thereof the agency shall take into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances including but not limited to the environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses  the applicants purpose for and any feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no environmental impact to wetlands or watercourses  the relationship between the short term and long

priority restore enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse resources  the character and degree of injury to or interference with safety health or the reasonable use of property which is caused or threatened by the proposed regulated activity  and impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses outside the area for which the activity is proposed and future activities associated with or reasonably related to the proposed regulated activity which are made inevitable by the proposed regulated activity and which may have an impact on wetlands or watercourses additionally if the wetlands agency holds a hearing because it found that the subject activity may have a significant impact the wetlands agency may not grant the permit unless it finds that the activity is acceptable under the criteria listed above and that there is no less environmentally damaging feasible and prudent alternative 12 under ab of the general statutes the wetlands agency must provide the dep with a copy of notice of its hearing on proposed regulations and a copy of the proposed regulations no less than 35 days prior to the hearing thereon dep must review and approve all proposed wetland agency regulations except proposed map revisions 13 the methodology described in dep bulletin #9 is a resource planning tool intended to be used for townwide or watershedwide assessments of wetland resources and is not designed to be used by applicants or wetlands agencies to evaluate the significance of the impact of activities proposed in permit
