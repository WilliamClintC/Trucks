mental state is specified by the section defining the offense b when the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense when the section neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense c voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal offense voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if failure to act constitutes a criminal offense evidence that a person was voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged d as used in this section 1 possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed or was aware of the possessors control of the thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession 2

certain nature regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby it is the persons specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature b a person acts knowingly regardless of the persons purpose when the person is aware that the conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature a person has knowledge or circumstances when the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist c a person acts recklessly when with heedless indifference to the consequences the person perversely disregards a known risk that the persons conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature a person is reckless with respect to circumstances when with heedless indifference to the consequences the person perversely disregards a known risk that such circumstances are likely to exist d a person acts negligently when because of a substantial lapse from due care the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the persons conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature a person is negligent with respect to circumstances when because of a substantial lapse from due care the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such circumstances may exist e when the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices to establish an element thereof then recklessness knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element when recklessness suffices to establish an element of an offense then knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element when knowledge suffices to establish an element of an offense then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element  50107  organizational criminal liability a an organization may be convicted of an offense

standards  601  lot arrangement and dimensional standards a purpose the purpose of this section is to regulate the arrangement of lots and building heights within a subdivision and to ensure that lot and height dimensions are consistent with the appropriate zoning district standards b all lots shall front onto a public or private road and all lots shall conform to or exceed the requirements of the udo and the zoning district regulations for the district in which they are located the following regulations shall govern the design and layout of lots and lot improvements 1 lot arrangement the lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties for reasons of topography or other conditions in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with health and building regulations and in providing approved driveway access to buildings on the lots from an approved road 2 lot dimensions all lots shall comply with the standards of table 5e for residential uses and table 5g for commercial uses 3 future subdivision lots where lots are more than double the minimum required area bzap may require that those lots be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where they would be necessary to serve potential lots all in compliance with the udo 4 side lot lines in general side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines or radial to curving street lines unless a variation from this rule is approved by bzap when such variance will give a better street or lot plan 5 corner lots dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for the construction of buildings observing the minimum front yard setback from both streets 6 building setback  residential districts the building setback line shall be established from the edge of the rightofway or the edge of an access easement it shall be equal to the building setbacks listed in table 5e unless otherwise platted in which case the platted setback shall take precedence as the minimum standard the setbacks in the rcd residential community development district shall be established by development standards approved by the board of zoning and planning and city council and shall take precedence in all cases over the platted setback building setback  commercial office and planned mixed use districts the building setback line shall be established from the edge of the rightofway or the edge of an access easement it shall be equal to the building setbacks listed in table 5g and shall take precedence in all cases over the platted setback 7 commercial and mixed uses depth and width of lots reserved or laid out for commercial andor mixed use purposes shall be adequate to provide for the offstreet parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development contemplated 8 depthtowidth ratio no lot shall have an average depth which is more than 45 times its average width however bzap or the director of community development as appropriate may permit a waiver of this recommended standard permitting the lot depth to be up to 35 times the average width 9 double frontage lots in general double frontage lots and reversed frontage lots should be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography or orientation as determined by bzap or the director of community development as appropriate as to lots included in any plat approved by the bzap and accepted by council after  the required depth of the front yard shall be the distance between the street rightofway line and the setback line shown on the plat if less than forty 40 feet as to any lots in any recorded plat which has greater restrictions than are required under this prdinance then these recorded restrictions shall apply and the board shall have no authority to grant variances therefrom for corner lots where the side yard abuts a street the platted setback and not the side yard setback required within a specific zoning district shall prevail if there is no platted setback then the minimum side yard setback shall be twenty 20 feet 10 lot frontage a lot shall front onto an improved public or private road lot frontage is measured at the rightofway line 11 side yard modification beginning at the front face on the building each side yard where required shall be increased in width by two 2 inches for each foot by which the elevation length of the building adjacent to the side yard exceeds forty 40 feet adjacent in this context means any portion of the side wall that is closer to the side property line than twentyfive percent 25% of the lot width at the place of measurement in no case other than corner lots shall the total elevation length of the side wall of a principal structure exceed fifty percent 50% of the average lot depth or the depth a this example illustrates how the side yard is modified as an extension is added to an existing home 12 rear and side yard computation in computing the depth of a rear yard or the width of a side yard where the rear or side yard abuts an alley onehalf 12 of the width of the alley may be included as a portion of the required rear or side yard as the case may be however in no event shall any building or structure be erected closer than five 5 feet from any lot line except accessory buildings c height modifications the height limitations stipulated elsewhere in this not apply to the following 1 places of public assembly places of public assembly in churches schools and other permitted public and semipublic buildings provided that these are located on the first floor of such buildings and provided that for each three 3 feet by which the height of such building exceeds the maximum height otherwise permitted in the district its side and rear yards shall be increased in width or depth by an additional foot over the side and rear yards required for the highest building otherwise permitted in the district d yard projections in rdistricts certain architectural features may project into required yards or courts as follows architectural feature front yards side

maintenance permanent culdesacs shall be limited to a maximum length of eight hundred 800 feet or serving twenty 20 dwelling units whichever is larger however in no instance shall a culdesac exceed one thousand two hundred 1200 feet in length the preferred culdesac design is circular landscaped islands are strongly preferred over paved islands and should be dedicated to an existing or proposed homeowners association for ownership and maintenance circular culsdesac should be designed with twentysevenfoot four and onehalfinch inside radius and a fortysixfoot oneinch outside pavement radius if an island is included culdesac islands as an option to a standard culdesac a oneway fifteenfoot wide circular lane can be used if approved by bzap or director of community development as appropriate
