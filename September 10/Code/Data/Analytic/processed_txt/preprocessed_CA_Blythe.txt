3 if subsections f1 and 2 are satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section  part 2008   variance procedure a nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the blythe city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the blythe city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the blythe city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 5 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the riverside recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 6 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency c appeal board 1 in passing upon requests for variances the blythe city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the a danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  f availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and k costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges 2 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and c determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 3 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections c1 c4 of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 4 upon consideration of the factors of subsection b1 of this section and the purposes of this chapter the blythe city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  part 2008 division iv

to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material b findings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the council and on findings incorporated in the cases of city of renton v playtime theatres inc 475 us 41 1986 young v american mini theatres 426 us 50 1976 and barnes v glen theatre inc 501 us 560 1991 and on studies in other communities including but not limited to phoenix arizona  minneapolis minnesota  houston texas  indianapolis indiana  amarillo texas  garden grove california  los angeles california  whittier california  austin texas  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  cleveland ohio  and beaumont texas  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 at least fifty communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united statessix hundred in 198 two thousand two hundred in 198 four thousand six hundred in 198 eight thousand five hundred fiftyfive in 1985 and two hundred fiftythree thousand four hundred fortyeight  8 as of  there have been one hundred five thousand one hundred twentyone reported cases of aids in the state of california resulting in sixtysix thousand four hundred fifty deaths 9 since 1981 and to the present there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the hiv antibody test in blythe california 10 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has steadily declined since 199 with fiftythree thousand eight hundred fiftyfive cases reported in 1991 and twenty thousand one hundred eightyseven cases reported in 1996 11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over three hundred twentyfive thousand cases being reported in 1996 12 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 16 the findings noted in subsection b1 15 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns 17 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 24 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 25 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter  part 1998   definitions as used in this
