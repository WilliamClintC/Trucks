________________________________________________________________________ 121201 goals and objectives for land use planning in the lodi area the following statements of goals and objectives represent concepts development criteria and local desires developed from objective planning standards and from a series of discussions with the lodi planning commission as such these goals and objectives provide a basis for formulation of the lodi development policy plan and for review of development proposals which will affect land use in the lodi planning area a general goals are to 1 promote a village land use pattern that is logical both in the relation of land uses to one another and to the community facilities and transportation facilities which serve the lodi areas population  2 provide opportunities for appropriate economic growth and diversification in the lodi area  1992 replacement 5 planning and zoning code 121201 3 provide adequate housing for those persons living or desiring to live in the lodi area  4 provide for planned orderly provision of sewer and water facilities in the lodi area  and 5 encourage development which is consistent with the community interest and which will be in harmony with the natural and man made amenities of the lodi area b specific objectives are as follows 1 residential development a new residential development shall be planned which will be safe convenient to local services and in harmony with the smalltown atmosphere of lodi to do this the village plan must provide direct convenient and proper access from all parts of the village to the center for proper accessibility to parks schools and shopping b higher density development should be encouraged to develop where it will be possible to create active pedestrian circulation between adjacent residences recreation areas shopping facilities and other local services c residential development should be planned to conform to the natural characteristics of the land specifically detailed consideration needs to be given to topography soil conditions surface water ie ponds and creeks and existing land cover 2 commercial development a appropriate areas for each of three kinds of commercial development shall be provided recognizing that different types of commercial activities have different site requirements the three kinds are the village center vehicular oriented development along major arterials and the concentrated shopping center serving a more extensive area b the development of compact commercial areas shall be encouraged wherever possible in order to minimize disruption of traffic on roads and to maintain the character of existing residential areas major traffic arteries need not be considered automatically for commercial development solely because of the number of vehicles they carry the functions of traffic movement and access to adjacent properties are often at odds on the other hand residential development is not unrealistic on major traffic arteries if adequate separation between traffic and residences is provided 6 1992 replacement lodi development policy plan 121201 c concentrated shopping center retail areas should be located carefully so as to void adverse effects on the character of the residential areas they serve d the basic function of the central business district of the village of lodi should be maintained to serve the retail and service needs of the areas individuals businesses and industries new development should be encouraged which will facilitate and enhance the primary pedestrian character of this area of the village development which will generate high traffic volumes and thereby disrupt pedestrian traffic in the downtown area eg drivein restaurants etc should be discouraged or carefully controlled 3 industrial development a an adequate supply of land shall be provided to permit controlled industrial growth of existing industries and development of new industries in the lodi area b land should be designated for industrial development on the basis of optimum conditions in each of the following categories 1 availability or potential availability of utilities such as water sewer and power  2 ease of access to major transportation networks  3 favorable physical conditions including consideration of soils flooding potential topography land cover and unique environmental features  and 4 adequate parcel size c industrial zones should be provided to properly separate industrial areas from surrounding residential areas d industrial areas should be protected from encroachment by nonindustrial uses which could hinder the efficient development and functioning of existing or future industries 1992 replacement 7 planning and zoning code 121201 4 thoroughfare system a a hierarchy of street types reflecting the need to accommodate different volumes of traffic in different areas should be developed giving due consideration to existing traffic volumes and the adequacy of existing thoroughfares 1 the limited access thoroughfare or expressway should be designed to carry heavy volumes of traffic at fast speeds and be completely free from direct access access from other streets should be gained only directionalized traffic movements in the form of grade separated interchanges by virtue of design these thoroughfares should be capable of moving traffic faster and safer than any other type of road 2 major arterials should provide direct access across the community as well as to neighboring communities these streets should have controlled signalized intersections wherever possible 3 collector streets should collect traffic from minor streets and direct it to major thoroughfares collector streets should not extend uninterrupted for long distances otherwise they might take on the traffic characteristics of major arterial routes 4 local or minor streets should be designed primarily as service streets for carrying the traffic that contiguous land uses generate since they are required to carry only low volumes traffic their design is primarily oriented to providing the best possible building sites rather than providing an alignment for the greatest volume of traffic local streets should be designed to discourage b land use proposals should result in a minimum of traffic across dangerous atgrade railroad crossings and along stretches of road which due to alignment grade or other safety features could not be made suitable for carrying large volumes of traffic without unreasonable expense 8 1992 replacement lodi development policy plan 121201 c land use proposals should be in general harmony with the existing transportation network in the lodi area highdensity proposals should be served directly by an existing major arterial or limited access thoroughfare while low density residential areas should be served directly by minor or local streets this strategy will prevent conflicts from development between existing or future land use and the streets which serve particular areas 5 community facilities a adequate fire and police protection facilities and government administrative offices should be provided which will serve the existing and future population of the village of lodi b maximum community use should be made of existing and planned public school facilities c outdoor recreation facilities and open space areas should be developed and preserved which will provide a full range of outdoor recreation opportunities for lodi area residents and which will preserve those unique environmental features of the lodi area which are of significant value to residents of the lodi area and medina county as a whole d the extension of public utilities and services should follow urban development on the periphery of the lodi area urban services should be discouraged in areas where the cost of providing such services would be prohibitively high where natural characteristics of the area are such that development would negatively alter unique natural features or where development would be negatively affected to a significant extent by existing physical conditions such as flood hazard potential or slippage due to steep topography 9 1992 replacement planning and zoning code 121202 121202 development policy alternatives for the village of lodi editors note planning commission responses are underlined a urban growth extent of growth desired by the village 1 should growth be encouraged at increased densities within areas already developed at lesser densities no 2 should growth be encouraged to occur within areas presently undeveloped at densities similar to adjacent areas already developed yes 3 if increased urban growth density is desired what specific type and density is desired in rl districts four units per acre in r2 districts six units per acre in r3 districts eight units per acre the planning commission agreed that land in the eastern portion of the village should be developed for residential purposes the intent of allowing mobile home developments was to provide a good mix of housing types in the village 4 should growth be discouraged in general the planning commission feels that growth should be of a planned orderly nature 5 what type of community is desired bedroom community industrial center commercial center the planning commission would like to encourage balanced small town living with the conveniences of a city the commission also would like to encourage developing into a community where most of the residents live and work within the village b thoroughfares an increase in growth will subsequently necessitate an increase in the number of thoroughfares or an increase in the capacity of existing thoroughfares 1 what arterials if any need to be expanded from twolane to four lane none 2 what other thoroughfare improvements are needed buffham road two rd 72 along with greenwich road ch 97 and avon lake road sr 83 may need to be widened in the future 3 are the thoroughfares in lodi adequate the major problem is deadend streets in the northeast section of the village additional residential growth in this area will increase the need to tie in residential streets with existing streets 10 1992 replacement lodi development policy plan 121202 c public services as the village grows additional services will also become necessary 1 is the existing sewer and water facility adequate the existing sanitary sewer facility has been designed for a population of  with the present village population being approximately  the location of the present treatment facility is felt to be excellent improvements to the storm water drainage system have been undertaken in the eastern portion of the village where drainage problems exist and more improvements are planned in this area 2 what is the present school capacity should any new school facilities be considered the cloverleaf school district encompasses five townships and includes five grade schools one junior high school and one high school 3 is the present status of police and fire protection adequate what are their shortcomings what improvements or expansion if any should be considered to adequately service anticipated growth quality and quantity of police protection are felt to be good quality of fire protection is also good the addition of a fire station on the west side of the village would be desirable due to potential crossing problems created by the norfolk and western railroad tracks running from the northwest to the southern portion of the village d open space the need for open space either as passive or active will become more apparent as the village grows hi size and density 1 if new areas of open space are desired should these areas be left in their natural state and developed for passive uses such as hiking and picnic facilities the planning commission has gone on record for open space in the village current open space areas consist of two community parks lodi community park and central park plus letha house field 2 is there a need for active recreational uses such as ball fields swimming pools playgrounds etc if so in what areas of the village is the need greatest two outdoor ball parks one outdoor basketball court and two outdoor tennis courts presently exist the need also exists for a swimming pool although the possibility of one being built in the near future is quite slim letha house field is the most logical place for further development of active recreational activities 11 1992 replacement planning and zoning code 121203 3 should the village incorporate the frequent use of green belt areas throughout the community three areas for future consideration were mentioned a the arch of the black river west of the village on sr 421  b the whetstone creek area  and c gravel pit areas e other the village might consider developing some unique community features into a primary focal point this could involve physical features such as unusually scenic topographic areas streams large trees etc a unique focal point could also be the development of the village center into a quaint and unusual shopping area with numerous specialty shops utilizing a similar architectural theme the central park was felt to be an appropriate focal point for the village being the location of outdoor concerts the indian statue etc 121203 summary of existing development patterns in the village a in general the village of lodi consisting of approximately two square miles in area is situated within the southwestern portion of medina county accessibility to and from the village is provided by two state highways sr 83 and sr 421 that traverse the corporation and one federal divided highway us 224 that bypass a mile north of lodi a survey of the land use in the village was carried out in january 197 to provide information needed for the future development of a policy plan among the major purposes it serves are the following 1 to acquire information about the size and actual use of each parcel of property the use and occupancy of each building and the yard and other open spaces about it  2 to gain a broad overview and understanding of the entire planning area in terms of predominant uses and activities  3 to acquire an understanding of relationships between the various types of land uses and activities  4 to help establish the proper general location and approximate size of needed public facilities and services  and 5 to gain a clear insight into existing conditions and relationships which are a prerequisite to the best practical application of sound growth policies and the 12 subsequent zoning districts 1992 replacement lodi development policy plan 121203 b physical characteristics of the village and its surrounding area 1 the village of lodi is interlaced with numerous drainage courses that eventually drain into the east fork tributary of the black river two branches of the east fork cut significant ravines within the village before turning northward to empty into the black river due to these precipitous ravines the lodi area experiences topographic variations that range from the lowest elevation in medina county of 860 feet above sea level occurring northwest of the village to elevations in excess of 1100 feet above sea level occurring in the northeast section of the community 2 the physical development and basic shape of lodi can be related directly to the extensive muck lands lying south of the village one may assume that the availability of these productive muck lands influenced lodis early location as an agricultural center the village center developed upon relatively level ground where major transportation routes junction skirting the impenetrable muck lands to the south later when the railroad also passed same area skirting the muck lands the village location was further strengthened the village gradually grew using up the original level area and proceeded to extend development onto the adjacent hills and plateaus between the numerous drainage courses consequently due to these muck lands lodis physical growth having been directed northward and westward in the past will in all probability continue to do so in the future as new growth occurs also having an effect on lodis future growth is the fia flood hazard boundary map recently published by the department of housing and urban development this map shows significant areas of the village designated as special flood hazard areas which will be affected by the new flood insurance program see map following the text of this chapter in short these designated areas will be restricted as to what types of development might occur in the future 3 soil types within the general area range from a chiliurban land complex located within the village center to extensive areas of carlisle muck located south of the village the following list describes the primary soil types occurring within the planning area 13 1992 replacement planning and zoning code 121203 a bennington silt loam this soil occurring in irregular five to seventyfive acre shapes is concentrated throughout the west and northwest sectors of the planning area seasonal wetness and slow permeability are common characteristics of this soil type b cardington silt loam this soil occurring in irregular five to 300acre shapes occupies much of the uplands of the northern portions of the lodi area surface runoff is moderate to rapid  consequently erosion is a moderate hazard like the bennington soils seasonal wetness and slow permeability create limitations to many nonfarm uses c carlisle muck this soil ranging in size up to approximately 400 acres is located primarily south of the village this extremely wet soil must be drained to be utilized crop production on this soil if well managed is well suited for vegetable and sod production due to the excessive instability of this soil it is limited to crop production d chiliurban land complex this gently sloping soil is located primarily within the village center it consists of areas of chili soils that have been partly disturbed as a result of grading and digging operations the fill areas are characterized by approximately one to three feet of fill material overlying chili soils these areas are commonly low in organic matter and available water capacity  consequently few limitations to most nonfarm uses exist e jimtownurban land complex this nearly level soil area is one that also has been disturbed as a result of grading and digging operations these soil areas consist of thin layers of sand and gravel having good drainage qualities f wallkill silt loam this soil occurring in oblong shapes of twentyfive acres or less is located immediately south of the village approximately sixteen inches of alluvium cover the lower organic matter in this soil  consequently excessive wetness and flooding hazard exist creating limitations for many nonfarm uses c major land use patterns within the village the village of lodi covers an area of approximately 1337 acres of this acreage only 525 acres of 393 percent has been developed for urban or urbanrelated purposes the remaining acreage is open and exists as either developable vacant land or areas of undevelopable steep topography and marshlands 14 1992 replacement lodi development policy plan 121203

effect of i71 is to influence residential building nearest the us 224i71 interchange seven miles east of the village 1992 replacement planning and zoning code 121203 primary development patterns within the village consist of residential uses utilizing the greatest amount of developed land two hundred twentyfive acres or 168 percent of the total village area is developed with either singlefamily twofamily multifamily or mobile homes although the primary concentrations are still within the village center new development is occurring to the east and northeast of the village commercial development is concentrated in two areas the village square and the medina streethighland road vicinity the latter being more recent will in all probability realize further expansion due to its accessibility to us 224 and the availability of land for expansion industrial uses comprise the second greatest user of land in lodi approximately seventyfive acres or 56 percent of the village is utilized for light and heavy industrial purposes industrial lands are concentrated within the western and southern sections of the village future expansion will be restricted to these same areas due primarily to excessive topographic variations throughout the remainder of lodi transportation is a predominant land use in lodi street and railroad right of ways entail approximately 117 acres of land within the village alone consequently these facilities provide a good base for future growth access to interstate 71 and us 224 can be easily attained from lodi good railroad accommodations exist within the west and southwest sectors of the village where the need is greatest to facilitate existing and future industrial activity land occupied by community facilities entails approximately fiftyone acres or 46 percent of the village community facilities for the purpose of this report include schools the fire station water towers the hospital cemeteries sewage treatment and public parks and recreational facilities several of these items such as sewer and water facilities will require future detailed study and planning due to their direct relationship to future growth the cost of these expanded facilities will have to be carefully evaluated when determining the desired growth and types of growth throughout the village of lodi the map titled generalized land use patterns following the text of this chapter presents in a generalized graphic form the major land use patterns within the village the land uses indicated on the map have been restricted to three basic uses residential commercial and industrial 16 1992 replacement 17 lodi development policy plan 121204 d conclusion the land use patterns within the lodi planning area can be directly related to the physical makeup of the area as previously discussed particular physical features such as the extensive muck areas and the varying topography have played a prominent role in the general shape of the village of lodi the map titled areas with severe limitations for development following the text of this chapter shows in a generalized form the three major types of physical restraints to development these physical restraints muck soils flood hazard areas and steep topography not only restricted past development to specific areas but will in all probability do so in the future consequently these physical data are utilized in the lodi development policy plan as formulated there has been no significant change in the percentage of land use the small amount of development in the last sixteen years has not changed the percentage of land use except for minor adjustments 121204 population and housing data for the lodi area a population growth and trends the following tables illustrate

of major rehabilitation the need for additional housing exists for the village of lodi a survey of housing needs within medina county was recently performed relative to a medina county housing policy program this survey which utilized the fourth count summary data from the 1970 census of housing indicated among other things that the county is in need of an additional 743 occupied units and 1358 rental units for lowerincome households although this need is countywide significant concentrations on this housing need were indicated for the harrisville township and village of lodi area the recently approved fortyeight unit apartment being processed by the farmers home administration for the northern sector of lodi indicates that the need does exist in this area and is being partially

the water is stored in three elevated storage tanks totaling 310000 gallons water is provided to the customers with a fourinch to eightinch line distribution system the lodi water system is a twolevel service system based on the ground elevation with a ground elevation of approximately 1000 feet being the break point between the two systems the high level system services the major residential area in the northeast portion of the village as of november 199 the lodi water system had approximately 1475 customers average daily consumption in1990 was 450000 gallons per day gpd by the year 200 consumption can be expected to total approximately 565000 gpd less than forty percent of the capacity of the three existing wells consideration in the future will need to be given to ensuring adequate fire flows with anticipated population and economic growth 22 1992 replacement planning and zoning code 121205 d wastewater the original lodi wastewater treatment plant consisting of an imhoff tank and sand filters was replaced by a mechanical aeration system in the early 1950s regulations regarding the quality of treated wastewater entering streams and lakes led to the addition of secondary tertiary and chlorination facilities to the lodi wastewater treatment facility in 1973 and 1988 a future expansion is expected to be completed in 1993 the present facility located at the end of grandview drive discharges into the east fork tributary of the black river the plant will be capable of biologically treating the wastes from a population equivalent of 6000 the average design flow will be 510000 gpd after the 1993 expansion the plant normally operates at 97% efficiency in the reduction of bod biochemical oxygen demand and 95% efficiency in the removal of suspended solids e

problem of fire protection south of the railroad tracks where industry is concentrated if a train happens to be blocking access to the area south of the tracks where a fire is underway fire trucks must take an alternative route using the us routes 42 and 224 bypass to reach the fire site this potential delay in fire response time could be critical especially for the industries located in the southwestern portion of the village the village should assess the degree of seriousness of this problem and the relative cost of alternative measures necessary to correct it as noted in the analysis of existing public services the southwest quadrant of the lodi planning area where industry is concentrated can be cut off from direct fire protection service in the event a train is crossing the n & w railroad tracks at bank street fire equipment in these circumstances must travel north on sr 421 west of us 224 and 42 south on richman road and east on bank street to reach a fire one alternative to consider is the construction of a fire substation on bank street west of the n & w tracks to serve this section of the lodi planning area g library services the lodi library opened officially in 196 the result of the efforts of various organizations and volunteers in 1989 the present location at 226 wooster street was extensively remodeled the lodi library is one of five community libraries which comprise the medina county district library system in 1989 the medina county district library finished automating the circulation system connecting lodi library with the other four community libraries as well as with seventeen other library systems in northern ohio which are part of the clevnet automation system the lodi library offers a variety of materials and services adult young adult and childrens books fiction and nonfiction  large print books  magazines and newspapers  video cassettes  and audio cassettes and compact disks programs and activities for all ages are offered throughout the year services to the homebound are also available services the lodi library has a collection of 24000 items with the use of the librarys reserve and fax systems however patrons have access to many more books magazines and newspapers than can be found on the librarys shelves the lodi library employs a staff of five and is open every day except friday and sunday for more information call 9481885 h hospitals the lodi community hospital a thirtybed accredited medicalsurgical hospital is located on a nine acre site on the west side of elyria street in lodi near the central area of the village care provided includes inpatient outpatient and twentyfour hour emergency room physicians service additional services include specialized diagnostic capabilities  an industrial health program  respite care for 25 dependent adults  surgery  and community education the hospital also owns centuryoflove preschool located at 411 medina street in lodi 1992 replacement lodi development policy plan 121206 the medical staff at lodi community hospital includes twenty physicians there are thirtyeight persons on the courtesy and consulting staff including dental podiatric and allied health professionals a specialty physicians clinic provides the services of additional visiting specialists on a regular basis there are a total of 140 additional hospital employees approximately twentyfive percent of whom are from lodi emergency ambulance service to the facility is provided emt and communities surrounding lodi including westfield center west salem chatham burbank sullivan spencer chippewa lake and seville an emergency air transport system also services the hospital on a call basis i cemeteries lodis main cemetery woodlawn cemetery is located on the northwest side of medina street sr 421 north of the central area of the village the facility is managed by an independent cemetery board 121206 lodi development policy plan recommendations a introduction development policy plan recommendations for the lodi planning area include recommendations for future development of the village of lodi and the key areas of harrisville township which surrounds lodi these recommendations were originally developed by the lodi planning commission with assistance from the staff of the medina county regional planning commission after a review of the characteristics of the lodi planning area pertinent to the development of a guide for future growth in 1978 existing development the natural features of the land the relationship of the planning area to the cleveland and akron metropolitan areas and the advice of local officials were analyzed in developing plan recommendations a total review of these recommendations was completed in 1992 and the same are set forth below the following recommendations are a summary of the final land use recommendations of the lodi planning commission these final recommendations are the result of several meetings during which a draft land use policy plan map was discussed and modified at the same time a draft zoning districts map was discussed and modified also in the following text a footnote with an a references a modification to the draft land use policy plan map while a footnote with a b references a modification to the draft zoning districts map a summary of these referenced modifications is provided in appendix a following the text of this chapter 26 these modifications are reflected in the generalized village of lodi development policy plan map one inch equals 1000 feet at the end of this chapter and the more detailed map one inch equals 400 feet on file at the village hall 1992 replacement planning and zoning code 121206 b general concepts of the lodi policy plan the development policy plan embodies the objective of maintaining the small town atmosphere in the village of lodi while providing appropriate urban services to urbanizing areas at the periphery of the village in a planned orderly fashion residential development is proposed in a range of densities each density based on existing residential development the suitability of the land for development and the efficiency with which services can be provided several varieties of commercial development are proposed at locations convenient to the market area the commercial activities would serve locations for industrial development are recommended based on existing industrial development pending development availability of transportation facilities the potential availability of water and sewer facilities and the suitability of land for industrial growth the following subsections describe the plan proposals in more detail c open space and planned development areas areas described in the lodi development policy plan as open space areas include lands which because of their unique natural characteristics and severe physical limitations for development should remain predominantly open low land susceptible to flooding or having soils which are saturated most of the year are appropriate in the open space category the lands bordering the east fork and the west fork of the black river clear creek and little killbuck creek are examples of areas which should experience very limited development also much of the land on both sides of garden isle road should experience only very limited development due to the marshy conditions and due to the lands high value for agricultural purposes lands having slopes of fifteen to twenty percent and over also pose significant problems for development these areas including land along the east fork of the black river and a portion of the drainage area west of harris road are recommended as open space areas open space areas should be used for extensive recreational activity eg wooded parks trails golf courses agriculture and selective planned larger lot residential development d rural residential areas the area surrounding the village of lodi is predominately agricultural or vacant with scattered singlefamily residential development as shown on the development policy plan map this general area surrounding the village should develop at a density of at least one dwelling unit du per two acres this scale of development is also recommended in the medina county development policy adopted  which states that in the rural agricultural or rural residential western portion of the county  in all but unique cases residential lot 27 sizes of two acres or perhaps considerably more should be required at this density individual lot sizes are large enough so that individual 1992 replacement lodi development policy plan 121206 septic systems and wells will be adequate for the indefinite future should the designated rural density areas fully develop in addition development at this density will not create an unmanageable demand on harrisville townships road system in the foreseeable future with present knowledge and the resulting expectations encouraging the maintenance of a rural character of development in the general area surrounding the village of lodi seems desirable the lodi planning area is not affected by the cleveland or akron metropolitan area to the extent of brunswick medina or wadsworth cities as a result development pressures will not be as intense as in the northern and eastern portion of medina county it is appropriate therefore that the general area surrounding the village of lodi retain its ruralagricultural pattern of development e urban service low density residential areas this recommended residential land use category consists of land that is or can be served with central sewer water and storm drainage facilities from the village of lodi in addition these areas are accessible to highways which can accommodate traffic that could be expected from residential development at urban densities the density of development recommended for these urban service low density residential areas is one to three du per acre al four general areas in the lodi planning area are recommended for this lower density residential development as follows 1 an area between prospect streetredfield street and harris road this area which is partially developed in singlefamily homes has fairly irregular topography and has a high potential for additional attractive home sites several streets currently deadend at the eastern end of the site a steeplysloped gully runs northsouth along the eastern end of the site 2 selected areas on the periphery of the village these areas are suitable for low density residential development due to their distance from local shopping facilities and services provided in the central area of the village in addition they are an appropriate transition area between outlying areas and the denser development near the core of the village 3 an area north of the hospital on both sides of elyria street a2 4 an area north of the n & w railroad tracks on the west side of the village this area was proposed for development as part of an application to the us department of housing and urban development in 1977 a3 28 1992 replacement planning and zoning code 121206 it can be anticipated that residential development in the above areas will consist of singlefamily homes however the potential exists for planned development which incorporates areas of open space or unique natural features as an integral component of the development in particular portions of the currently undeveloped area east of prospect and redfield streets could develop in such a fashion carefully integrating the steeplysloped gully area paralleling harris road as an open space component and accessible to persons living in the general area f urban service medium density residential areas the medium density residential area comprises most of the existing residential area in the central portion of the village and includes an area on the north side of highland avenue in the northeast portion of the planning area an additional medium density residential area is proposed in the northeast area of the lodi planning area served by redfield street vandemark road medina street and buffham road the recommended density of development for these areas is from three to six dwelling units per acre a4 it can be anticipated that future residential development in these areas may consist of a mix of singlefamily and twofamily units as with the urban service low density residential areas potential exists for larger scale planned unit developments which might incorporate clustered units of singlefamily homes or duplexes with selected open space areas while still keeping the overall development densities at a relatively low level as indicated on the lodi development policy plan map urban service medium density residential areas are located with easy access to existing or proposed general and local commercial areas thereby clustering higher density development in a relatively compact area g urban service high density residential areas the area on the west side of the junction of medina street and redfield street is proposed for high density residential development portions of this area have already been developed as mobile home parks the recommended density for this area is from six to twelve dwelling units per acre a5 for mobile home development the recommended density is six to eight dwelling units per acre with careful site planning incorporating open spacerecreation areas this density of development can be accommodated this area is easily accessible to shopping facilities and police and fire protection services and is adequately buffered from adjacent development which may occur locally in the future 29 a high density residential area is proposed along the south side of highland drive in the vicinity of the existing water tower an existing apartment development is located on this site like the previously mentioned high density residential site this area is close to shopping and other local services natural buffers should be provided between this high density area and the lower density residential area to the south 1992 replacement lodi development policy plan 121206 finally a high density area is proposed for eventual development north of the n & w tracks north of lee drive on the west side of the village this area was proposed for development as part of an application to the us department of housing and urban development h central commercial area the central commercial area in the village of lodi is really the core or heart of the lodi planning area most of the area consists of existing businesses with several interspersed dwelling units this commercial center provides a business and shopping area of significance for southwestern medina county and portions of wayne and ashland counties concentrations of comparison shopping facilities financial and business services personal services and entertainment facilities should be encouraged here care needs to be taken in this area in developing regulations designed to facilitate pedestrian movement and to enhance the villages smalltown atmosphere the lodi planning commission has indicated that central park in the downtown area should remain the focal point for the village i local commercial areas the purpose of this type of development in the lodi planning area is to provide for uses principally to accommodate the sale of convenience retail goods and personal services purchased frequently for daily or weekly needs it is intended that the design of these commercial areas will encourage groupings of establishments located on a unified site providing adequate offstreet parking facilities as well as efficient and safe vehicular and pedestrian access these areas are intended to serve primarily residents of the lodi area rather than a regional market in addition to existing local commercial areas several other local commercial areas are suggested on the lodi development policy plan map including the following 1 a small area located at the intersection of bank street and west drive this area is currently developed in mixed light manufacturing and commercial uses because it is adjacent to a high density residential area on sunset street the best use for this land is probably as a commercial center rather than for manufacturing uses as lodi develops residentially to the north along west drive a cluster of carefully designed personal service and retail shops at the above intersection would be of significant value 30 2 the roughly triangular parcel of land on the south side of bank street between sunset street and archer street this parcel includes a marshy area that should not be developed existing uses are commercial and residential 1992 replacement planning and zoning code 121206 3 an area along the south side of bank street from archer street east to the n & w railroad tracks which currently is developed in mixed residential and commercial uses also the area on the north side of bank street from the east boundary of the mabry property to the east boundary of the mong property near the railroad b6 4 the area on the north side of wooster street from market street east to approximately the intersection with greenwich road including the small triangle formed by sr 83 harris road and wooster street access to the developing residential area to the north from wooster street should be reserved commercial area also an area of land from the west side of richman field to the east side of the donald dearth property is designated for eventual commercial use b7 5 the area of the intersection of buffham road medina street and redfield street this is a key area for carefully planned commercial development in that significant residential growth is occurring and planned in this northeast quadrant of the lodi planning area several commercial uses already exist in the area without careful controls however this area could develop into a hazardous unattractive area j light industrial areas the purpose of this land use is to accommodate light industrial uses such as repair storage manufacturing processing wholesaling and distribution free from the encroachment of nonindustrial uses the uses allowed are those which because of their normally unobjectionable characteristics can be in relatively close proximity to residential retail and institutional uses several areas are suggested as light industrial districts in the lodi planning area as follows 1 the general southern area of the village expansion could occur to the south toward new archer street 2 an area in the southeast section of the lodi planning area in the vicinity of sr 83 harris road greenwich road and the b & o railroad tracks an 31 existing light manufacturing plant on the site has potential for limited expansion to the southeast towards harris road k heavy industrial areas the purpose of this land use is to provide for certain manufacturing assembling and fabricating activities including large scale or specialized industrial operations which generate large volumes of truck or rail traffic these activities have external physical characteristics which will significantly affect surrounding areas 1992 replacement lodi development policy plan 121206 1 two areas are designated for heavy industrial use in the lodi planning area as follows a an existing heavy industrial area east of garden isle road north of the old nickel plate railroad tracks and a small section south of the tracks the remaining area south of the railroad tracks is poorly drained with muck soils evident b the general area west of billman street to west dr 2 the area south of the village surrounded almost entirely by the b & o and n & w railroad tracks has soils with severe limitations for industrial use and fire equipment access problems and is therefore recommended to remain undeveloped the area is currently farmed 3 the above recommendations for industrial land are based on a detailed analysis of fifty potential sites in the lodi planning area sites were rated against the following set of industrial development factors a site configuration b topography c soils d flooding potential e air and water pollution impact potential f sewer and water potential g proximity to major transportation corridors h existing land useadjacent land use i existing natural cover j unique physical features l highway improvements 1 the lodi development policy plan map specifies two major improvements to roads in the lodi planning area that should be 32 considered in the near future these improvements include a construction of a northsouth collector street serving the eastern portion of the village several eastwest local streets currently deadend in this area b as discussed earlier fire equipment access to present industries in the ohio street area could be delayed by trains using the n & w tracks across bank street there is not apparent short term inexpensive solution to this problem providing access to land north of ohio street across the n & w tracks at ohio street will compound the accessibility problem for fire equipment 1992 replacement 33 planning and zoning code 121206 c consideration should be given to analyzing the potential of providing emergency access to this site from the property on the north side of bank street adjacent to the n & w tracks a second alternative would be to provide emergency access to this site off richman road parallel to and north of the n & w tracks a third alternative is the extension of railroad street north and west eventually to richman road to open up this land area these access provisions should be considered in conjunction with the eventual elimination of truck traffic in the ohio street area it is suggested that billman street be connected with bank street to provide a new truck access to the existing and future industries in this area 3 other areas for future transportation analysis include congestion in the area of the intersections of medina and redfield streets south along medina street to the entrance to woodlawn cemetery as commercial and residential growth occurs in this section of the lodi planning area consideration will need to be given to signalizing this intersection and adding turn lanes on medina street to reduce congestion from turning traffic 4 additional improvements may be necessary in the near future in two areas proposed for clustered commercial development a the developing area along wooster street in the vicinity of the emerald health care office if the proposed collector street is built to the north and if additional businesses locate along the north side of wooster street an additional turning lane would alleviate potential congestion also traffic hazards may increase at the intersection of sr 83 and greenwich road to the point where signalization may be necessary as a safety measure access drives to businesses in this area will need to be carefully located to minimize potential site distance problems especially in the vicinity of the intersection of sr 83 and greenwich road b the proposed local commercial area on the south side of bank street east of sunset street additional commercial development in this area may create a need for an additional turn lane the congestion problem may be compounded if the proposed industrial access road is considered off the north side of bank street north to billman street 4 special attention needs to be given to establishing a proper street classification system see b4 currently the lodi subdivision regulations classify only local and culdesac streets 1992 replacement 34 lodi development policy plan 121206 major arterials and collector streets need to be considered for future addition to the existing street classification system the suggested street classification system for existing streets is as follows a limited access thoroughfare  us 224 and 42 b major arterials  sr 83 elyria street and wooster street  sr 421 medina street and bank street c collector streets  prospect streetredfield street  railroad streetacademy street  garden isle road buffham road  harris road ch 149 richman road ch 69 d local streets  all remaining existing streets in the village of lodi 5 growth can be more effectively managed by coordinating this local thoroughfare planstreet classification system with appropriate land uses as suggested in the zoning the subdivision regulations m community facilities 1 local and regional parks a four major areas for expansion of lodis existing park system are recommended as discussed in an earlier section of this chapter lodi has approximately onehalf the recommended acreage for public outdoor recreation areas this shortfall can be alleviated acquisition of land in the following general areas 1 rugged topography and dense woods make the drainage area west of harris road a suitable location for a neighborhood park serving the residential area developing to the east 2 extension of lodis community park to the northeast to roughly surround the mobile home park area developing off medina and redfield streets is recommended 3 potentially a linear park following the drainage area of the east branch of the black river north to letha house park part of the medina county park district system could be established phased development program involving local state andor federal cooperation 4 a potential linear park following the east branch of the black river serving the area proposed for residential development in a recent application to the us department of housing and urban development is recommended 35 1992 replacement planning and zoning code 121207 b as part of the subdivision review process special consideration should be given to requiring that land be set aside from well designed recreation areas tot lots or playgrounds these types of recreation areas would be most appropriate in existing or new higher density residential areas including mobile home parks 2 fire and police protection as noted in the analysis of existing public services the southwest quadrant of the lodi planning area where industry is concentrated can be cut off from direct fire protection service in the event a train is crossing the n & w railroad tracks at bank street fire equipment in these circumstances must travel north on sr 421 west of us 224 and 42 south on richman road and east on bank street to reach a fire one alternative to consider is the construction of a fire substation on bank street west of the n & w tracks to serve this section of the lodi planning area 3 village hall the current facility is in an ideal central location to serve the residents of the lodi planning area handicap access is limited to the entrance to the police department and the council chambers 121207 implementing the lodi development policy plan a all areas of medina county are facing development pressures which are scattering urbantype land use over the landscape a little bit at a time  for the most part on a lot by lot basis along existing roads the rural atmosphere is thereby being obliterated bit by bit and we are creating the need for public health and welfare related services and facilities in the most expensive and inefficient way the changes and demands that population increases create need to be continuously identified and analyzed by the lodi planning commission in its efforts to guide land use in the village b the development policy plan is one of many tools that can be used by village officials and citizens in the land use planning process it is important in making development decisions that the community officials realize the difference between a plan and the planning process a plan is usually thought of as a definite course of action which may be set out in formalized policy statements a map of future land use and public improvements a definite program of capital improvement or an actual budget for capital improvements these plans all vary in the degree of specificity with which they treat local problems with the exception of the goals and objectives statements they all have a static character which if misunderstood can lead to problems in the use of plans as working tools in the decisionmaking process of government a plan embodies judgments of what is one desirable future development pattern for an area and what public improvements and regulations are necessary to achieve that pattern however sound these judgments may be they nevertheless are made at a given point in time with imperfect knowledge of the cause and effect relationships of the past and only educated projections of the nature of future events consequently a plan cannot account for all contingencies 36 1992 replacement lodi development policy plan 121207 competing interests in the community and events that affect the community but which are beyond its powers of control will result in a need to alter the plan at periodic intervals so that it may remain a realistic development guide this is not to say that the plan should not be a strong development guide  it is vital to accept the plan as a firm but adaptable tool too often a plan is viewed as an inflexible course of action which is an effective tool only so long as no deviations from it occur such an attitude will lead to the plan being discarded as no longer realistic when deviations from the plan recommendations do take place c the approach that must be developed is to treat the lodi development policy plan as a tool in a continuing planning process planning should be a philosophy of approaching problems and of considering the broad spectrum of shortrange and longrange development implications of every change in legislation every public improvement and every proposed private development subject to review by lodi officials treating planning as an integral part of all decisions is one of the most significant contributions officials can make in creating a community that can be transmitted with pride to succeeding generations future residents of lodi will be affected by development decisions made today a systematic and rational approach to public decisions affecting community development in the lodi area must be taken the lodi development policy plan which should be revised periodically should serve as a guide for making development decisions it should be looked upon as a reference point against which the desirability of alternatives to plan recommendations and innovations in land development can be evaluated when specific development proposals occur that do not coincide with lodi development policy plan recommendations a number of questions should be asked by officials responsible for guiding land development as follows 1 does the specific proposal differ only in detail from lodi development policy plan proposals and substantially conform to the concepts and relationships guiding the lodi development policy plan in reference to topography adequacy of roads soils existing and proposed land use and community goals and objectives 2 would the realization of the proposal work toward the goals of the lodi area have the perceived objectives of the community changed since preparation of the lodi development policy plan 3 what would be the possible detriment to the lodi area as a result of the specific development would the desirable attributes of the development outweigh the undesirable 4 are the public improvements and utilities necessary to the proposed development available or can they be made available without placing an undue burden on lodis financial resources 37 1992 replacement planning and zoning code 121207 5 have marketing considerations or unexpected trends in the rate or type of development made lodi development policy plan recommendations unrealistic or undesirable 6 is the proposed departure from the plan a precedent that is desirable for lodi in view of the possibility of similar proposals in the future 7 is the proposal desirable from an overall land planning standpoint both in a shortrange and a longrange sense 8 have the many side effects of the proposed development on the lodi area been considered objective advice sought and opinions gathered from residents does the proposed development continue to seem to be an asset to the community and sufficient reason to amend the lodi development policy plan if the answer to these questions in each case is yes then the flexibility of the lodi development policy plan probably should be recognized the most important point is that indiscriminate departures from the lodi development policy plan with no evaluation of overall consequences should be avoided again the vital considerations in approaching land development decisions are 1 to take a comprehensive approach to community development in the lodi area whereby the many implications of one development on other systems in the community can be evaluated and 2 to treat planning as a continuing process rather than an activity that begins and ends with a program or a project d other tools besides the lodi development policy plan are available to the lodi planning commission in its land use planning efforts these include those tools and powers that are currently available for use and those that could be initiated in the future as follows 1 lodi zoning subdivision regulations in conjunction with the lodi development policy plan these two tools are the key to the arrangement and quality of future land uses in the village it is s zoning subdivision regulations that recommendations contained within the lodi development policy plan can be implemented by requiring for example that a collector street right of way be dedicated by a subdivision developer or that a proposed commercial development be located only in an appropriate section of 38 the village 1992 replacement lodi development policy plan 121207 special notes should be made here of the administrative zoning responsibilities of the planning commission and zoning inspector vs the legislative zoning responsibilities of the village council of the ohio revised  the legislative authority of a municipal corporation may create an administrative board to administer the details of the application of the regulations and may delegate to such board    the power to hear and determine appeals    and to permit exceptions to and variation from the district regulations in other words the village council being a lawmaking body is ultimately responsible for enacting or establishing the local zoning ordinance and approving any amendments or rezonings which may be proposed whereas the village planning commission is responsible for implementing the ordinance the lodi planning commission has been charged with the responsibilities of 1 administering the zoning 2 acting a as a board of zoning appeals the planning commission is also responsible for the issuance of conditional use permits the lodi planning commission acting as a board of zoning appeals has powers very similar to those of the courts under the ohio revised the board of zoning appeals is given three basic powers a to hear and decide appeals  b to grant variances  and c to grant conditional zoning permits appeals and variances only go to the board of zoning appeals upon appeal by an applicant whereas the board of zoning appeals is directly presented applications for conditional uses it is recommended however in the state of ohios model zoning regulations that the board of zoning appeals be composed of different individuals from the planning commission if the planning commission does function as the board of zoning appeals separate records must be maintained the duties of the zoning inspector designated by the mayor lie in the administration and enforcement of zoning as with the planning commission the inspectors duties are administrative only these responsibilities do not include 39 determining whether conditions of the law such as density land use etc are or are not proper these are legislative responsibilities 1992 replacement planning and zoning code 121207 the zoning inspector is the key individual in the administration of zoning he or she is the person the public will most directly associate with zoning also the inspectors work is essential in the fair and impartial enforcement of the regulations of the zoning 2 housing purpose of a housing code is to correct existing unsafe or substandard housing conditions and to prevent future deterioration due to improper maintenance housing codes may apply retroactively to existing dwelling units the village of lodi may benefit from the adoption of a housing code 3 federal and state assistance a a vast array of federal and state programs are available for potential funding of many kinds of local improvement projects these federal and state programs often are in the form of grants inaid whereby the federal andor state government provides a grant or loan for a portion or share of the project cost and the local community shares the remaining cost of the project federal andor state funding for projects is rarely for an extended period of time usually funding is provided for initial or frontend costs of a project with the local community expected to pay the longterm cost of operating the project caution must be exercised by a local community not to overextend itself in these types of projects which have hidden long term costs the state of ohio has a broad range of financing tools available for local community improvements including the following 1 community improvement corporations a community improvement corporation cic is a nonprofit corporation organized for the sole purpose of advancing encouraging and promoting the industrial economic commercial and civic development of a community or area a cic can serve as the conduit taxexempt public financing is made available to private enterprise the ohio revised cics with a wide range of powers such a corporation may borrow money issue bonds and secure them make loans acquire lease and otherwise dispose of real and personal property and other assets acquire real estate 40 acquire construct operate lease and dispose of industrial plants or business establishments acquire and dispose of stock etc and mortgage or otherwise encumber property it acquires 1992 replacement lodi development policy plan 121207 a cic may also become a member or a stockholder of an ohio development corporation formed under ohio rc by resolution or ordinance any political subdivision or combination of subdivisions may designate a cic as the agency of the subdivisions for industrial commercial distribution and research development and may enter into an agreement with the cic to provide for such development 2 nonprofit corporations a nonprofit corporation may be formed for any purpose or purposes for which natural persons lawfully may associate themselves the law defines nonprofit corporation as a corporation which is not formed for the pecuniary gain or profit of its members trustees officers or other private persons and whose net earnings or any part thereof is not distributable to them in general the authority of nonprofit corporations subject to limitations prescribed by law or in its articles of incorporation includes the following powers to take property by gift devise or bequest  to make donations for charitable and other purposes  to acquire use lease and dispose of property  to form or acquire control of other corporations whether nonprofit or for profit  to become a member of another corporation  to borrow money and to issue bonds etc and to secure such obligations  to invest its idle funds  and to do all things permitted by law and to exercise its authority in this state and elsewhere historically nonprofit corporations have provided valuable benefits and services to many communities for example numerous low and moderate income housing developments throughout ohio are a direct result of nonprofit sponsorship for a variety of development and redevelopment projects the nonprofit corporation may serve as a highly advantageous tool when used in various combinations with more specialized organizations 3 ohio development financing commission the ohio development financing commission was established by statute to promote the welfare of the people of the state to 41 stabilize the economy

time maintain adequate provision for the security of the health safety convenience comfort prosperity or general welfare of the communitys inhabitants in order to accomplish such a dual objective provision is made in this chapter for a more detailed consideration of each conditionally permitted use as it relates to location design size method of operation and intensity of land use which in
