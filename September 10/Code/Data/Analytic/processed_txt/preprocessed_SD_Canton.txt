by resolution of the city commission fees established in accordance with this section shall be paid upon submission of a signed application subdivision plan exemptions  minor plats the purpose of this section is to provide for the timely review of minor plats and replats including plats for transfer of ownership that do not discernibly impact surrounding properties environmental resources or public facilities no concept plan preliminary plan or development engineering plans are required minor plats and replats are administratively approved by the authorized official and city engineer and must comply with all requirements of a plat in the plat any request for new or additional public infrastructure or facility services after the land has platted may be required to comply with development engineering plans at the request of the city engineer a minor plats 1 a minor plat is a plat containing not more than three lots fronting on an existing street and meets all of the following requirements a does not require the dedication of rightofway or construction of new streets  b does not require the creation of easements or has existing services that do not require additional easement size  c does not create a lot or tract eligible for any public or private improvements other than sidewalks  d does not landlock or otherwise impair convenient ingress or egress to or from the rear side of the subject tract or any adjacent property  e does not change the grades from the grading plan which was submitted and approved with the original plat or if the grades are going to be changed then a grading plan shall be submitted and approved for the minor plat or replat  f does not significantly change any plans that have been prepared for the placement of any other utilities in

process designed to help a developer save time and expense in preparing a preliminary plan and a plat a concept plan does not have a requirement for engineering information  however the more engineering design work that is done the developer will be more likely to avoid rezonings or major amendments because of lot and block reconfigurations due to drainage and other utility requirements the advantage of a concept plan is that city staff will provide important information upfront that may significantly affect lot and block layout and utility plans it is recommended that at least some preliminary drainage engineering be completed during the concept plan stage all concept plans for review shall be submitted to the authorized official a prior to the submission of the preliminary subdivision plan and if needed rezoning to the planning commission the developer shall submit a concept plan to the authorized official which will also be routed to the city engineer city staff comments on the concept plan shall be sent to the developer within 15 working days the requirement for a concept plan may be waived by the authorized official and city engineer if access permits have been approved and it is a residential subdivision with less than ten acres or a nonresidential subdivision with less than five acres a developer may choose to submit a concept plan for comments that has all elements of a preliminary subdivision plan b the concept plan shall contain the following information 1 the general layout of streets and access points to adjacent street systems  location of

considerations permit 2 streets should be designed to convey residents conveniently throughout the neighborhood and to the parks schools and shopping areas of the neighborhood and to adjacent neighborhoods when a subdivision is designed or constructed in conjunction with another use such as retail office apartments park or school of a neighborhood scale the local andor collector road system should be designed to provide roadway connections between the various uses 15 c arterial streets in order to maintain the traffic carrying capacity of the arterial streets by limiting access to it from individual lots and in order to protect the residents of property adjacent to arterial streets from the high traffic volumes associated with the street property along such arterials shall be

side or rear yards are adjacent to the arterial street to an arterial street shall have an additional width to provide for an extra setback to offset the impact of high traffic volume this design will be accepted only for a limited distance due to the number of streets which would intersect with the arterial 3 access roads access roads may be used as the city grows into the areas in the county where they have been required under some circumstances they would also be appropriate for commercial and industrial development access roads shall be constructed to city standards with a rightofway width of 50 feet 4 rear access roads rear access roads are recommended for commercial developments in this way the access can serve two tiers of lots and alleviate the dangerous turning movements onto and off of arterial streets 5 nonresidential land uses and higher density residential land uses including multiple family units and townhouses are particularly suitable for the intersection of two
