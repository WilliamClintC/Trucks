tests indicate the presence of alcohol or any illegal controlled substance in the system of the employee it will be presumed that the employee is impaired the presumption of impairment will result in the suspension with pay pending discharge investigation of the employee pursuant to procedures set forth in of these rules and regulations 5 during the period the employee is suspended with pay an investigation shall take place this investigation will be completed within five eighthour work days saturday sunday and holidays excluded unless extended by the human resources director during this investigation the employee may own effort attempt to rebut the presumption of impairment for example the employee may submit to a blood test within three hours of the cityblwadministered test for the presence of alcohol or controlled substances if such blood test produces a negative result the presumption of impairment may be considered rebutted depending upon such factors as the timing of the blood test and other circumstances surrounding the impairment 6 if after the investigation is completed and if it has been determined that a violation of the alcohol and controlled substance policy

a handbook entitled drug abuse and alcohol misuse training guide for cdl drivers which will include 1 the identity of the person designated to answer questions about the materials 2 the categories of drivers who are subject to the provisions of 49 cfr  sufficient information about safety sensitive functions performed by those drivers to make clear what period of the work day the driver is required to be in compliance 4 specific information concerning driver conduct that is prohibited 5 the circumstances under which a driver will be tested for alcohol andor controlled substances 6 the procedures that will be used to test for the presence of alcohol and controlled substances protect the driver and the integrity of the testing process safeguard the validity of the test results and ensure that

reasonable suspicion test shall receive an initial 60 minutes of training on controlled substance use and 60 minutes of training on alcohol use which will include the physical behavioral speech and performance indicators of probable use of controlled substances and alcohol d the cityblw recognizes that alcoholdrug abuse andor dependency are medicalbehavioral conditions that can be successfully treated employees with alcoholdrug problems are encouraged to voluntarily request assistance from the employee assistance program eap participation in an eap is totally voluntary and completely confidential  however a request for assistance or actual participation in an eap does not excuse an employee from violation of this policy the only exception to the eap confidentiality provision occurs when an employee is referred to the eap by cityblw authorized management personnel   1296  9200  10  11200  1 4426070  referral for rehabilitation a the alcohol and controlled substance policy allows a supervisor to refer an employee for assessment and rehabilitation as an option other than termination for a violation of this policy however this option is only available if the employee has not committed an act or omission which presented an immediate danger to the public himself or other employees or if he has not committed any felony or a misdemeanor related to his job or acts or omissions which could reasonably impact his ability to do his job effectively b all referrals will be coordinated cityblw human resources department factors to take into account when this decision is made include 1 the employees length of service  2 the employees position and performance in that position prior to and during impairment  3 the severity of the policy violation  4 the publicity concerning the violation including the loss of credibility or believability of an employee who exercises discretionary judgment in the duties of his position  5 whether the violation involved substance dependence or an incidents motivated by reasons other than substance dependence for example the sale of drugs to other employees c after a decision to refer the employee for rehabilitation has been made the employee will be counseled by the department head and a representative of the human resources department at this counseling session the policy shall be reviewed with the employee the employee shall sign the employee consent and referral form it must be made clear to the employee at this time that the referral is his last chance and that he must make the firm choice between rehabilitation or termination d if an employee must take time off to take part in a rehabilitation program the absence will be treated as sick leave e upon returning to work the employee will be subject to unannounced alcoholcontrolled substance screening tests for a minimum period of 36 months with an emphasis on postweekend mondays testing or after vacations however a fixed schedule will not be established unless circumstances clearly require more frequent testing there shall be no more than one screening test per month   1296  9200  11  11200  1 4426080  screening test program a testing quality and techniques to be utilized 1 the cityblw will establish a professional relationship with a professional laboratory which shall comply with all current national institute of drug abuse standards an assessment of the laboratory will be performed which will include a review of how samples are actually tested  all procedures involved chain of custody of sample notation of time and place sample was taken the amount of turn around time that will elapse before a result is reached etc  qualifications of the laboratory personnel  and a check of the internal quality control records of the laboratory 2 all samples will be collected at the laboratory hospital or other city designated testing facility including but not limited to any law enforcement agency that has an intox 5000 or similar device the samples will be carefully checked and marked with the name of the employee the date and time the sample was collected and the location where the sample was collected a chain of custodycontrol will be established so that samples are properly handled before testing occurs every effort must be made to assure that the sample being tested is the sample actually collected from the employeeapplicant in question 3 when testing for alcohol a breathalyzer such as the intox 5000 or other similar device any measurable amount of alcohol found will be sufficient for a presumption of impairment unless such measurement is the result of consumption of alcohol or an alcohol related product that is prescribed by a licensed physician some departments may require more restrictive standards than described herein the employee has the right to request a blood test if he so desires this test will be at the employees expense 4 the cityblw will use urine samples for controlled substance testing even though the presence of foreign metabolites in urine does not necessarily indicate impairment but rather recent exposure to the substance however alternatives such as blood tests and hair analysis may be interpreted as more intrusive but may be used if necessary 5 the cityblw will utilize the testing standards of the department of transportation regulations as provided in 49 cfr as amended and as may be hereafter amended the following is a brief outline of the methods to be used the cityblw will utilize the technique known as immunoassay technique of chemical testing the immunoassay technique has a high degree of reliability under optimal conditions however all positive immunoassay tests on current employees shall be confirmed by another more elaborate and thorough test method confirmatory methods include any one of the following techniques thin layer chromatography gas chromatography and gas chromatographymass spectrometry all positive immunoassay tests on samples from applicants will be confirmed with a repeat administration of the immunoassay technique on the sample b testing procedure the alcohol and controlled substance policy provides for testing in six different situations the preemployment or promotiondemotiontransfer screen  the screen as part of any required annual physical examination  the reasonable suspicion screen  post accident screen  random test program for safety sensitive positions and drivers of cityblw vehicles  and random test program after return to work after an alcohol andor controlled substance policy violation 1 post employment offer or promotiondemotiontransfer screen a after an employment offer has been made to a prospective employee but before employment has begun or any employee who has applied for and is offered a safety sensitive position a position requiring driving of a cityblw vehicle or any other position with the cityblw not prohibited by law will be sent to the human resources department and scheduled for a post employment offer alcohol and controlled substance test the applicant when sent to the testing facility will be asked to sign consent and notice form job candidate applicants including current employees are required to provide truthful statements to the questions asked any false statements provided will result in rescission of the employment offer and in the case of current employees could result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment b should the applicant refuse to sign the consent form the application process will continue on the application it will be noted only that the applicant refused screen it will not mention suspected alcohol or drug use by the applicant the applicant has a right to refuse to consent to the test but the cityblw has a parallel right to refuse to hirepromotetransfervoluntarily demote the applicant however should an inquiry as to that specific application be made by the applicant or a third party at a later date the city will protect the confidentiality of the application process for instance if another employer contacts the cityblw in the context of a reference check the only information that will be supplied is that the applicant did apply and that the applicant failed to meet the qualifications necessary for employment it will never be revealed that the applicant refused to consent to an alcoholcontrolled substances screen unless required to defend answer andor litigate a suit or other legal action c if the applicant being considered for the position has consented to the test and the test results are negative the applicant will continue with the hiring process however should the test results come back positive the test must be confirmed utilizing the same sample originally provided d all test results are confidential except as provided herein if a preemployment test is confirmed a positive result all inquiries as to why the applicant who is not a current cityblw employee was not hired will be answered by stating the applicant failed to meet the qualifications necessary for the position however the cityblw reserves the right to notify the current department head of any employee who tests positive on any alcoholdrug screen conducted as a part of any application process for another position within the cityblw organization all applicants with a confirmed positive result may reapply at a later date at which time heshe will submit to another alcoholcontrolled substance screening test 2 medical examination screen a at the time the employee is to undergo a required medical examination the alcohol and controlled substance policy should be explained to the employee and heshe will sign the employee consent and notice form at the testing facility alcohol testing may be performed by the use of the standard breathalyzer intox 5000 or any similar device approved by the state crime lab director at a city designated testing facility including but not limited to any law enforcement agency that has such equipment b should the employee refuse to sign the consent form the medical examination will proceed after the examination has been completed the employee will be suspended with pay following the procedure set forth in of these rules and regulations the employee may be terminated for insubordination pursuant to the procedure set forth in of these rules and regulations the stated reason for terminating an employee will never be refusal to submit to urinalysis but rather insubordination or failure to follow the legitimate instructions of supervisors or other reason listed in c if the employee consents to the test and the test results are negative the employee can return to work if he has passed the rest of the medical examination however should the test results indicate the presence of alcohol or controlled substances that test result must and will be confirmed by one of the more specific confirmatory tests cited above utilizing the same sample originally provided if the confirmatory test also indicates the presence of alcoholcontrolled substances the employee will be assumed to be impaired and may be suspended with pay pending investigation for discharge in accordance with the alcohol and controlled substance policy and of this chapter d during the period of suspension an intensive investigation into the employees employment background and the circumstances behind the alleged policy violation will take place after the investigation is completed and there is sufficient cause to believe that a policy violation has occurred the employee will be either 1 disciplined up to and including termination  or 2 referred for assessmenttreatment by his department head e if after the investigation has been completed it is determined that a policy violation has not occurred for example if the employee successfully rebuts the assumption of impairment by submitting to a blood test within three hours after the original test and the results of which are negative the employee will be reinstated to his former position 3 reasonable suspicion screen a the screen upon reasonable suspicion involves a great deal of discretion on the part of supervisory personnel the supervisory training program will provide precise guidelines as to what is involved with identifying a potential alcohol or controlled substance abuser the task of identifying potential abusers does not include diagnosing a worker the fact that a problem exists is all that is to be discussed when dealing with an employee  that is demonstrated employee behavior it is not the position of the supervisor to act in the role of a diagnostician when it is suspected that an employee has violated the alcohol and controlled substance policy the employee will only be told that jobrelated problems have developed and that it is suspected that these jobrelated problems are the result of alcohol andor controlled substance abuse the underlying cause of such abuse should not be a concern of the supervisor b the phrase reasonable suspicion means that a screening test should be administered if it is reasonable to suspect that an employee has violated this policy c a suspicion must be based upon objective indications of substance abuse or other policy violations therefore forms have been developed to provide guidance to supervisors in assessing whether a reasonable suspicion exists as well as providing documentation of the basis of a decision to require an alcohol or controlled substance test thorough documentation of all steps of an investigation for a possible violation of this policy is a must including the date and time of any discussion with the employee for further information see above procedural guide for violations 4 post accident screen after an onthejob accident involving injury to the employee or others or property damage the department head with approval of the human resources director may require testing for alcohol andor controlled substances 5 random testing for safety sensitive positions the random testing program shall include all employees who 1 perform safety sensitive functions see d above which shall include but is not limited to those employees who regularly drive a cityblw vehicle as part of the required duties of their position  or 2 are required by the federal highway administration fhwa 49 cfr to maintain a commercial drivers license employees in safety sensitive positions as described above are subject to random alcohol and controlled substance testing at an annual percentage for the calendar year as prescribed by the federal highway administration for all cdl holders the tests will be unannounced and will be reasonably spaced throughout the year drivers chosen for a random test must proceed immediately upon notification of the random test to the designated test site 6 return to duty after policy violation if an employee has been relieved of duty for

the board of zoning appeals shall not issue and are not granted the authority to issue variances to any of the regulations relating to vehicle use areas as contained in this paragraph  all such variance requests must be submitted to city council for consideration h encroachment most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of critical root zone loss if encroachment is anticipated within the critical root zones of specimen trees stands of trees or otherwise designated protected tree zones the following preventative measures shall be employed 1 clearing activities roots often fuse and tangle among trees the removal of trees adjacent to tree save areas can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees wherever possible it is advisable to cut minimum 2footdeep trenches eg with a ditchwitch along the limits of land disturbance so as to cut rather than tear roots trenching may be required for the protection of specimen trees 2 soil compaction where compaction might occur due to traffic or materials storage the tree protective zone must first be mulched with a minimum 4inch layer of processed pine bark or wood chips or a 6inch layer of pine straw 3 trenching the installation of utilities protective zone should occur by way of tunneling rather than trenching 4 grade changes moderate fill can be tolerated within a trees critical root zone with the prior installation of an aeration system a decrease in grade is best accomplished use of retaining walls or terracing 5 when irreparable damage has occurred to trees within the tree protective zones the trees must be removed and replaced with new trees of comparable unit value i remediation remedial site reclamation and tree care procedures shall be implemented when encroachment within protective zones has caused damage to either the tree or the trees growing site and the damage is reparable if encroachment is anticipated these horticultural practices should be employed as preemptive measures to improve tree survival 1 once a tree has been damaged it is advisable to delay pruning until the deadwood becomes evident 13 years pruning for deadwood removal is then recommended the removal of live plant tissue from a damaged tree can accelerate decline pruning of root severed trees may reduce the possibility of wind throw trees which have not been affected by construction activities can be pruned for maintenance of the trees health appearance and safety 2 fertilizer applications will enhance the vigor of trees stressed by site disturbances thereby promoting root development 3 a trees adequate root development and ultimately its chances for survival is improved with reclamation of the growing site whenever possible the soil should be brought back to its natural grade compacted soils within the critical root zones of trees should be aerated the air exchange nutrient and water holding capacities of soils can be improved with soil amendments a 4 to 6inch layer of mulch material such as pine bark or wood chips spread within the critical root zones of trees on construction sites is extremely beneficial 4 the availability of water to trees on construction sites should be monitored if grade changes or excessive rain cause the accumulation of water near trees steps must be taken to improve drainage conversely if grade changes or prolonged periods without rain cause a drought situation then irrigation may be necessary j revegetation 1 the replacement of trees must occur if the edf does not meet the calculated sdf the quantity of replacement trees must be sufficient so as to produce a

and landscaping ordinance is to insure that a minimum density of trees is maintained on all developed sites occasionally this intent cannot be met because a project site will not bear the required density of trees to provide an alternative in such cases contributing to the city of marietta tree replacement fund according to the tree replacement fund requirements is acceptable see  the following standards have been established for administering the alternative compliance method a the department of development services must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance in no instance shall more than 75% of the required density units be met compliance documentation from a certified arborist or licensed landscape architect must be provided to assure that as many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site in question b the land disturbance permit will only be issued after the department of development services has approved the request for alternative compliance and received the necessary documentation andor funds 2 tree replacement fund as an alternative method of compliance the city of marietta will accept donations that will be used for the purposes of purchasing planting and maintaining trees on public property funds may be used for the purchase of forested green space funds may also be used for the creation of landscape

as set out herein former div 714  7140171409 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from  adopted dec 11 2013 71401  findings and purpose the city of marietta makes the following findings of fact a the city of marietta finds that signs are a proper use of private property are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment as such signs are entitled to the protection of the law in the absence of regulation however the number of signs tends to proliferate with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares in addition the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises b regulation of the size height number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses to enhance the business and economy of the city to protect the public investment in the streets and highways to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas to promote industry and commerce to eliminate visual clutter and blight to provide an aesthetically appealing environment and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the citys citizens c the city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either control of traffic or of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going as such nearly all governmental signs are erected purely for public safety purposes moreover their use in the public rightofway is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public the mayor and city council finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations even where signs serve a propriety purpose such as identifying markings on utility poles public utility signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally of locations where there may be temporary losses of power d the city finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function for instance address numerals are used for the sole purpose of providing addresses which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies signs at the entrances to subdivisions or major developments favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls while such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this division the provisions of this division are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners the city further finds that holiday decorations such as strings of light are not signs but rather seasonal ornamentation not controlled by this division e in considering the appropriate level of sign regulation for the city the mayor and city council has considered planning studies reports news articles and related information from a variety of sources the mayor and council has determined that digital signs pose unique and substantial hazards to traffic caused by a higher level of distractibility than nondigital signs in addition digital signs are inconsistent with the aesthetic standards established for the city these standards are intended to a promote signs that are subordinate to and in aesthetic harmony with their location on buildings and their surrounding environment  b identify requirements that safeguard life public health aesthetic quality and welfare by regulating the location size number illumination construction maintenance and quality of materials of all signs and eliminate visual clutter and blight within the city c promote the safety of persons and property by providing that signs do not create traffic or other hazards due to collapse fire visual obstruction decay or abandonment d promote and encourage designs that reflect the appropriate scale historic character and pedestrian orientation of the city as well as encourage designs that reflect the architectural scale aesthetic quality and vehicular and pedestrian orientation of commercially zoned districts within the city 13201  1 71402  permit requirements the following requirements and limitations shall apply with regard to signs in addition to provisions appearing

our scenic beauty  that tourism and trade from both resident and nonresident roadway users is an essential part of our economy  that touristoriented directional signs and logo signs erected pursuant
