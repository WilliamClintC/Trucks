wastewater treatment capacity from its inventory of available capacity on a first in  first served basis to development projects receiving preliminary plan approval the date to be used in determining the development applications first in date shall be the date the city executes a letter of completion evidencing successful completion of the development permit application for review and processing bexempted from the wastewater treatment allocation process are developments having received preliminary plan approval prior to the effective date of this policy included within this exception are previously approved developments where wastewater treatment capacity was a key finding in multiple development phases or in the overall planned unit development approval for a property this exemption is consistent with city code and reflects the fact that preliminary plan approval includes a finding and establishment of sufficient sewer capacity to serve the development calso exempted from the wastewater treatment capacity allocation process are development permit or building permit applications requiring three or fewer equivalent dwelling units of wastewater treatment capacity the city will endeavor to maintain in reserve sufficient unallocated wastewater treatment capacity to serve such exempted developments  policy implementation  establish priority date priority for allocation of available wastewater treatment capacity will be based on the date the letter of completion for a development application is executed by the city planning department   applicant to establish wastewater treatment capacity required ait is the responsibility of the development applicant to file a statement with the planning department expressing in equivalent dwelling units the total wastewater treatment capacity required by the development the statement must be accompanied by supporting engineering evidence of same which is acceptable to the city at the express written discretion of the city the requirement to submit acceptable supporting engineering evidence may be waived for residential developments or the residential portion of mixed use developments the applicants statement of required capacity and accompanying engineering evidence unless waived must be received and accepted by the city before a letter of completion may be executed bthe public works director will establish in writing the definition of an equivalent dwelling unit and express the result in terms of the unit of wastewater treatment capacity measurement used in the citys lease for additional capacity the definition of an equivalent dwelling unit will be provided to each applicant along with notification that the application process is not complete until the city has received the applicants statement of required capacity and has accepted the supporting engineering evidence   reserving and assigning capacity aassignment of capacity will be a two stage process not later than the date a letter of completion is to be prepared the planning director will compare the then available wastewater treatment capacity with the amount of capacity required by the applicant development if sufficient capacity is available the required capacity will be tentatively reserved for the development but not yet permanently assigned assignment occurs only after preliminary development approval by the planning commission or planning department for expedited land divisions etc bif less than the required capacity is available the applicant will be notified and given the option of reserving up to the available amount and subject to this wastewater treatment capacity limitation proceeding to planning commission review however this will require a new application submittal with the development proposal scaled down or phased accordingly cif there is no available treatment capacity or the applicant refuses the option to proceed with an application scaled to meet available capacity the development permit review process stops due to the lack of capacity to serve the development dif additional capacity becomes available for allocation it will be offered for reservation or assignment to developments previously receiving a reservation or assignment of less than the full amount required offers of such additional available capacity will be made to developments in chronological order based on the date of their letter of completion ecapacity reserved for a development is held only for the period in which the development application is under active review by the planning commission or while a planning commission decision is under legal appeal if the development application is approved the reserved quantity is assigned to the development fif the development application does not receive final approval the reserved capacity reverts to the inventory of available wastewater treatment capacity for reallocation gshould the planning commission require changes in the development plan that reduces the amount of wastewater treatment capacity required the reserved amount will be reduced if the planning commission requires changes that increase the amount of capacity required the additional amount will be reserved subject to the availability of the added amount required at the time of the planning commission action and assigned upon preliminary approval hcapacity assigned to a development continues only as long as the development permits andor building permits are valid if the permits lapse and are not administratively renewed the assigned but unused capacity reverts to the inventory of available capacity   transferability of assigned capacity consistent with existing city policy practice and legal framework the wastewater treatment capacity assigned to a development is transferable and runs with the land any owners wishing to transfer capacity to a different owners must provide notice of such a transfer to the city the purpose of the notice requirement is to permit the city to maintain accurate ownership records to use for future communication with owners regarding the assigned capacity   inventory and record keeping athe planning director will establish and maintain an ongoing inventory of available wastewater treatment capacity in establishing the amount of capacity available the director will calculate and set aside from the total treatment capacity an amount sufficient to accommodate anticipated requests for capacity for subsequent development phases of previously approved developments as defined in the wastewater treatment allocation policy bthe director will also calculate and set aside an amount for anticipated requests for development approval or sewer hookup from developments of three or fewer equivalent dwelling units the amount set aside for this type of use must be projected to last for the entire term of the citys lease of treatment capacity to determine a reasonable amount of capacity to set aside for this type of use we recommend that the planning director annually calculate a threeyear moving average of actual sewer hookup requests to serve developments of three or fewer equivalent dwelling units this average annual projected requirement times the number of years or fraction thereof remaining in the lease is the amount to setaside each year for projected demand from this type of exempt use cthe total treatment capacity remaining after combining setasides for previously approvedreviewed development plus the amount for three or fewer equivalent dwelling unit hookups is the total available capacity for reservation and assignment to new development dthe planning department will promptly record in writing and provide to the planning director a record of 1each amount reserved  2amount moved from reserved to assigned  3amounts allocated under the exempt setaside provisions  and 4any reserved or assigned amounts reverting to the treatment capacity inventory enot less than monthly the current

citys neighborhoods this chapter provides standards for the orderly expansion and improvement of neighborhoods based on the following principles 1make efficient use of land and public services implement the comprehensive plan and provide minimum and maximum density standards for housing 2accommodate a range of housing needs including owneroccupied and rental housing 3provide for compatible building and site design at an appropriate neighborhood scale 4reduce reliance on the automobile for neighborhood travel and provide options for walking bicycling and transit use 5provide direct and convenient access to schools parks and neighborhood services 6utilize subdistricts to add additional allowed uses to the uses in the r singlefamily residential base district 7utilize overlay districts to limit uses in the underlying base district bthe old town and low density residential overlay zones are established to reflect the unique history and character of those two areas of the city old town was originally platted with lots 50 feet by 150 feet 7500 square feet in size the maintenance of that open character and density is important to maintaining the identity of that area the low density overlay zone area is a portion of fairview that has had historically large lots of an acre or more while it is anticipated that the area will eventually change to a higher density zone changes initiated by property owners the city will wait until those changes are proposed to consider the appropriateness of increasing the density in that portion of fairview     permitted land uses

the minimum density of the zoning district in which they are located projects proposed at less than the minimum density must demonstrate on a site plan or other means how in all aspects future intensifications of the site to the minimum density or greater can be achieved without a variance for the purposes of this subsection new development shall mean intensification of the site by adding new primary dwelling units other than accessory dwelling units or land division of the property new development is not intended to refer to additions to existing structures rehabilitation renovation remodeling or other building modifications or revisions of existing structures bminimum density calculation multiply the total gross site area by 80 to obtain total net site area divide the total net site area by the maximum lot size and multiply that figure by 80 to determine the minimum density or the minimum number of required units for example density for a fiveacre parcel would be calculated in the following manner net site area   total site area 217800 sq feet  multiplied by 80 for streets and roads 174200 sq feet  density   net site area 174200 sq feet  divided by 6000 sq feet  minimum lot area 2903 minimum density   2903 multiplied by 80 2322 therefore 23 units is the minimum number of units which must be placed on the site this is only one example  actual lot sizes will vary based on the proposed building type and the lot area standards in fmc  the flag pole portion of the flag lot shall be considered buildable for the purpose of calculating densities see figure b figure b

variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense creation of a nuisance cause fraud on or victimization of the public nor otherwise conflict with existing local laws or regulations jvariances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare kvariances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry floodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria except subsection d of this section and otherwise complies with fmc  lany applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation mupon consideration of the factors of

habitat functions by making a public dedication or executing a restrictive covenant ebuffer averaging buffer averaging is permitted for new development activities excluding any existing building footprint area already encroaching into the riparian resource area reductions from the standard buffer setback distances shall be accomplished the buffer distance on a site buffer averaging involves decreasing a portion of the riparian buffer within the proposed development site and increasing the buffer in another area the new buffer area will need to provide equivalent or enhanced protection of

residential uses as well as retailoffice commercial and business park uses these uses are located in the areas where suitable services and facilities are currently provided or can be provided as development occurs in addition this plan area allows for pedestrianoriented development with good connections via the sidewalks trails and street system from residential areas to parks schools open spaces retail and office uses   village concept this section describes the desired feel and texture of a mixed use community development fairview village is designed to be a functioning mixed use neighborhood with a range of housing types and commercial stores chapters  are intended to implement this objective and to ensure a successful livable neighborhood the village will provide a commercial core or downtown area to provide the daily necessities of nearby residents the village main street should be architecturally unified with wide landscaped pedestrianfriendly sidewalks retail and office buildings are brought to or near the sidewalks with parking located to the rear of the site the design of the streets should slow the flow of automobile traffic and allow pedestrians to easily cross at intersections principal retail uses such as grocery anchors and hardware stores will have adequate parking and walkways that encourage pedestrian travel to the branch bank dry cleaners video store and other retail stores and residences this commercial core will be located south of ne halsey a major bus route the commercial core is immediately surrounded by high density housing apartments and townhouses are located to ensure a two to fiveminute walk for basic necessities this segment of the village which will provide the fabric and feel of urban living is intended to encourage a diminished reliance on the automobile for transport to basic services as the streets move away from the grid of the commercial core they begin to meld with the topography of the land and fairview creek the housing becomes less dense with small and larger lot singlefamily homes all still within walking distance of the village center a network of pedestrian ways and trails will provide

standards administration design standards administration purpose applicability types of design standards  design standards administration these guidelines provide sufficient guidance relating to new developments to enhance an area and provide sufficient services   purpose the design guidelines provided in this article protect the city by requiring sufficient access circulation landscaping parking etc that not only provides sufficient services but also buffers uses and creates livable and accessible neighborhoods   applicability all developments within the city must comply with the provisions of chapters  some developments such as major projects requiring land division andor site design review approval may require detailed findings demonstrating compliance with each chapter of the code for smaller less complex projects fewer code provisions may apply though some projects will not require land use or development permit approval they are still required to comply with the provisions of this article   types of design standards the citys development design standards are contained in both land use districts and design standards it is important to review both articles and all relevant code sections within the articles to determine which standards apply the city may prepare checklists to assist property owners and applicants in determining which sections apply aeach land use district provides design standards that are specifically tailored to the district for example the residential district contains building design guidelines that are different than those provided in the town center commercial district due to differences in land use building types and compatibility issues in addition each district provides special standards that are meant to address the impacts or characteristics of certain land uses bthe design standards contained within the following chapters apply throughout the city for all land use types   access and circulation   landscaping street trees fences and walls   vehicle and bicycle parking   public facilities standards   sign regulations  and circulation purpose vehicular access and circulation pedestrian access and circulation  purpose the purpose of this chapter is to ensure that developments provide safe and efficient access and circulation for pedestrians and vehicles fmc  provides standards for vehicular access and circulation fmc  provides standards for pedestrian access and circulation standards for transportation improvements are provided in   vehicular access and circulation aintent and purpose the intent of this section is to manage vehicle access to development connected street system while preserving the flow of traffic in terms of safety roadway capacity and efficiency access shall be managed to maintain an adequate level of service and to maintain the functional classification of roadways as required by the citys transportation system plan major roadways including highways arterials and collectors serve as the primary system for moving people and goods access management is a primary concern on these roads local streets and alleys provide access to individual properties if vehicular access and circulation are not properly designed these roadways will be unable to accommodate the needs of development and serve their transportation function this section attempts to balance the right of reasonable access to private property with the right of the citizens of the city and the state of oregon to safe and efficient travel it also requires all developments to construct planned streets arterials and collectors and to extend local streets to achieve this policy intent state and local roadways have been categorized in the transportation system plan by function and classified for access purposes based upon their level of importance and function see  regulations have been applied to these roadways for the purpose of reducing traffic accidents personal injury and property damage attributable to access systems and to thereby improve the safety and operation of the roadway network this will protect the substantial public investment in the existing transportation system and reduce the need for expensive remedial measures these regulations also further the orderly layout and use of land protect community character and conserve natural resources by promoting welldesigned road and access systems and discouraging the unplanned subdivision of land bapplicability this section shall apply to all public streets within the city and to all properties that abut these streets caccess permit required access to a public street requires an access permit in accordance with the following procedures 1permits for access to city streets shall be subject to review and approval by the city engineer based on the standards contained in this chapter and the provisions of the transportation standards an access permit may be in the form of a letter to the applicant or it may be attached to a

existing landscaping new landscaping street trees fences and walls  purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote community health safety and welfare by protecting natural vegetation and setting development standards for landscaping street trees fences and walls together these elements of the natural and built environment contribute to the visual quality environmental health and character of the community trees provide climate control during summer months and wind screening during winter trees and other plants can also buffer pedestrians from traffic walls fences trees and other landscape materials also provide vital screening and buffering between land uses landscaped areas help to control surface water drainage and can improve water quality as compared to paved or built surfaces the chapter is organized into the following sections  landscape conservation this section prevents the indiscriminate removal of significant trees and other vegetation including vegetation associated with streams wetlands and other protected natural resource areas this section crossreferences which regulates development of sensitive lands  new landscaping this section sets standards for and requires landscaping of all development sites that require site design review this section also requires buffering for parking and maneuvering areas and between different land use districts note that other landscaping standards are provided in of this title land use districts for specific types of development  street trees this section sets standards for and requires planting of trees along all streets for shading comfort and aesthetic purposes  fences and walls this section sets standards for new fences and walls including maximum allowable height and materials to promote security personal safety privacy and aesthetics     landscape conservation aapplicability all development sites containing significant vegetation as defined below shall comply with the standards of this section the purpose of this section is to incorporate significant native vegetation into the landscapes of development and protect vegetation that is subject to requirements of the significant environmental concern and riparian buffer overlay zones the use of mature native vegetation within developments is a preferred alternative to removal of vegetation and replanting mature landscaping provides summer shade and wind breaks and allows for water conservation due to larger plants having established root systems bsignificant vegetation significant vegetation means 1significant trees and shrubs individual trees

chapter is to provide basic and flexible standards for development of vehicle and bicycle parking the design of parking areas is critically important to the viability of some commercial areas pedestrian and driver safety the efficient and safe operation of adjoining streets and community image and livability historically some communities have required more parking than is necessary for some land uses paving extensive areas of land that could be put to better use because vehicle parking facilities can occupy large amounts of land they must be planned and designed carefully to use the land efficiently while maintaining the visual character of the community this chapter recognizes that each development has unique parking needs by providing a flexible approach for determining parking space requirements ie minimum and performancebased standards this chapter also provides standards for bicycle parking because many people use bicycles for recreation commuting and general transportation children as well as adults need safe and adequate spaces to park their bicycles throughout the community   applicability all developments subject to site design review including development of parking facilities shall comply with the provisions of this chapter   vehicle parking standards athe minimum number of required offstreet vehicle parking spaces ie parking that is located in parking lots and garages and not in the street rightofway shall be determined based on the standards in table a there is no minimum number of offstreet parking spaces required in the town

areas sanitary sewer and water service improvements storm drainage utilities easements construction plan approval and assurances installation  purpose and applicability apurpose the purpose of this chapter is to provide planning and design standards for public and private transportation facilities and utilities streets are the most common public spaces touching virtually every parcel of land therefore one of the primary purposes of this chapter is to provide standards for attractive and safe streets that can accommodate vehicle traffic from planned growth and provide a range of transportation options including options for driving walking bus transit and bicycling this chapter is also intended to implement the citys transportation system plan bwhen standards apply unless otherwise provided the standard specifications for construction reconstruction or repair of transportation facilities utilities and other public improvements within the city shall occur in accordance with the standards of this chapter no development may occur unless the public facilities related to development comply with the public facility requirements established in this chapter the street cross sections found in the fairview transportation system plan may be modified to accommodate alternative stormwater management methods in accordance with the adopted stormwater design manual subject to the approval of the public works director the public works director may require modification of the typical cross section to accommodate alternative stormwater management methods when associated with development proposals such modifications may be applied as conditions of development approval cstandard specifications the city engineer shall establish standard construction specifications consistent with the design standards of this chapter and application of engineering principles they are incorporated in this code by reference dconditions of development approval no development may occur unless required public facilities are in place or guaranteed in conformance with the provisions of this code improvements required as a condition of development approval that require a dedication of property for a public use when not voluntarily accepted by the applicant shall be roughly proportional to the impact of development findings in the development approval shall indicate how the required improvements are roughly proportional to the impact of the proposed development on public facilities erough proportionality report where the applicant objects to the imposition of any applicable development standard under this chapter that required a dedication of property for a public use the applicant must provide a rough proportionality report justifying an alternative level of improvements including 1the estimated extent on a quantitative basis to which the improvements will be used by persons served by the building or development whether the use is for safety or convenience  2the estimated level on a quantitative basis of improvements needed to meet the estimated extent of use by persons served by the building or development  3the estimated impact on a quantitative basis of the building or development on the public infrastructure system of which the improvements will be a part  and 4the estimated level on a quantitative basis of improvements needed to mitigate the estimated impact on the public infrastructure system exh 1 1    transportation standards transportation standards are necessary so that the fairview street system remains intact and well connected streets are critical to the connection of neighborhoods businesses schools etc it is important to regulate roadway sizes locations and rightofway dimensions the street standards are based directly on the fairview transportation system plan traffic calming measures are addressed in the adopted transportation system plan the city of fairview has no formalized trafficcalming plan but has recently adopted a speed hump management program the street alignment illustrations used in the proposed code are taken directly from the transportation system plan   transportation improvements adevelopment standards no development shall occur unless the development has frontage or approved access to a public street in conformance with the provisions of access and circulation and the following standards are met 1streets within or adjacent to a development shall be improved in accordance with the transportation system plan and the provisions of this chapter  2development of

agrees not to remonstrate object against the formation of a local improvement district in the future in lieu of street improvements if one or more of the following conditions exist aa partial improvement may create a potential safety hazard to motorists or pedestrians  bdue to the developed condition of adjacent properties it is unlikely that street improvements would be extended in the foreseeable future and the improvement associated with the project under review does not by itself provide increased street safety or capacity or improved pedestrian circulation  cthe improvement would be in conflict with an adopted capital improvement plan  or dthe improvement is associated with an approved land partition on property zoned residential and the proposed land partition does not create any new streets bvariances variances to the transportation design standards in this section may be granted by means of a class b variance as governed by of this title exceptions to a variance may be granted under this provision only if a required improvement is not feasible due to topographic constraints or constraints posed by sensitive lands ccreation of rightsofway for streets and related purposes streets shall be created approval and recording of a final subdivision or partition plat  except the city may approve the creation of a street by acceptance of a deed  provided that

section do not apply to a structure that was lawfully established or to a permit that was lawfully issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section an application for a permit to alter expand or otherwise modify a lawfully permitted structure that is submitted after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section is subject to the provisions of this section 2normal maintenance and repair of an existing legal dock is permitted 3legal nonconforming docks are subject to nonconforming uses and developments att 1 introduction  introduction this chapter provides standards and procedures for variances and nonconforming situations ie existing uses or development that do not comply with the code this code cannot provide standards to fit every potential development situation the citys varied geography and complexities of land development requires flexibility this article provides that flexibility while maintaining the purposes and intent of the code the variance procedures provide relief from specific code provisions when they have the unintended effect of preventing reasonable development in conformance with all other codes the standards for nonconforming uses and development are intended to provide some relief from code requirements for older developments that do not comply  purpose class a variances class b variances class c variances variance application and appeals  purpose the purpose of this chapter is to provide flexibility to development standards in recognition of the complexity and wide variation of site development opportunities and constraints the variance procedures are intended to provide flexibility while ensuring that the purpose of each development standard is met because some variances are granted using clear and objective standards they can be granted by means of a type i procedure other variances as identified below require a type ii or iii procedure because they involve discretionary decisionmaking   class a variances aclass a variances the following variances are reviewed using a type i procedure as governed by of this title using the approval criteria in subsection b of this section 1front yard setbacks up to a 10 percent change to the front yard setback standard in the land use district 2interior setbacks up to a 10 percent reduction of the dimensional standards for the side and rear yard setbacks required in the base land use district 3lot coverage up to a 10 percent increase of the maximum lot coverage required in the base zone 4landscape area up to a 10 percent reduction in landscape area overall area or interior parking lot landscape area bclass a variance approval criteria a class a variance shall be granted if the applicant demonstrates compliance with all of the following criteria 1the variance requested is required due to the lot configuration or other conditions of the site  2the variance does not result in the removal of trees or it is proposed in order to preserve trees if trees are present in the development area  3the variance will not result in violations of of this title or other design standards   class b variances aclass b variances due to their discretionary nature the following types of variances shall be reviewed using a type ii procedure in accordance with of this title 1variance to minimum housing density standard  the city may approve a variance after finding that the minimum housing density provided in of this title cannot be achieved due to physical constraints that limit the division of land or site development physical constraint means steep topography sensitive lands  unusual parcel configuration or a similar constraint the variances approved shall be the minimum variance necessary to address the specific physical constraint on the development 2variance to vehicular access and circulation standards  where vehicular access and circulation cannot be reasonably designed to conform to code standards within a particular parcel shared access with an adjoining property shall be considered if shared access in conjunction with another parcel is not feasible the city may grant a variance to the access requirements after finding the following athere is not adequate physical space for shared access or the owners of abutting properties do not agree to execute a joint access easement  bthere are no other alternative access points on the street in question or from another street  cthe access separation requirements cannot be met  dthe request is the minimum adjustment required to provide adequate access  ethe approved access or access approved with conditions will result in a safe access  and fthe visual clearance requirements will be met 3variances to street tree requirements  the city may approve approve with conditions or deny a request for a variance to the street tree requirements in of this title after finding the following ainstallation of the tree would interfere with existing utility lines  bthe tree would cause visual clearance problems  or cthere is not adequate space in which to plant a street tree  and dreplacement landscaping is provided elsewhere on the site eg parking lot area trees 4variance to parking standards athe city may approve variances to the minimum or maximum standards for offstreet parking upon finding the following ithe individual characteristics of the use at that location require more or less parking than is generally required for a use of this type and intensity  iithe need for additional parking cannot reasonably be met of onstreet parking or shared parking with adjacent or nearby uses  and iiiall other parking design and building orientation standards are met bthe city may approve a reduction of required bicycle parking if the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed use by its nature would be reasonably anticipated to generate a lesser need for bicycle parking cthe city may allow a reduction in the amount of vehicle stacking area required in for driveif such a reduction is deemed appropriate after analysis of the size and location of the development limited services available and other pertinent factors bvariance to maximum or minimum yard setbacks to reduce tree removal or impacts to wetlands the city may grant a variance to the applicable setback requirements of this code for the purpose of preserving a tree or trees on the site of proposed development or avoiding wetland impacts modification shall not be more than is necessary for the preservation of trees on the site cvariances to transportation improvement requirements the city may approve approve with conditions or deny a variance to the transportation improvement standards based on the criteria for granting variances when a variance request cannot be supported by the provisions of that chapter then the request shall be reviewed as a class c variance   class c variances apurpose the purpose of this section is to provide standards for variances which exceed the class a and class b variance criteria in this article class c variances may be granted if the applicant shows that owing to special and unusual circumstances related to a specific property the literal application of the standards of the applicable land use district would create a hardship to development which is peculiar to the lot size or shape topography sensitive lands or other similar circumstances related to the property over which the applicant has no control and which are not applicable to other properties in the vicinity eg the same land use district  except that no variances to permitted uses shall be granted bapplicability 1the variance standards are intended to apply to individual platted and recorded lots only 2an applicant who proposes to vary a specification standard for lots yet to be created subdivision process may not utilize the class c variance procedure 3a variance shall not be approved which would vary the permitted uses of a land use district capprovals process and criteria 1class c variances shall be processed using a type iii procedure using the approval criteria in subsection c2 of this section in addition to the application requirements contained in this code the applicant shall provide a written narrative or letter describing hisher reasoning for the variance why it is required alternatives considered and compliance with the criteria in subsection c2 of this section 2the city shall approve approve with conditions or deny an application for a variance based on finding that all of the following criteria are satisfied athe proposed variance will not be materially detrimental to the purposes of this code to any other applicable policies and standards and to other properties in the same land use district or vicinity  ba hardship to development exists which is peculiar to the lot size or shape topography sensitive lands or other similar circumstances related to the property over which the applicant has no control and which are not applicable to other properties in the vicinity eg the same land use district  cthe use proposed will be the same as permitted under this title and city standards will be maintained to the greatest extent that is reasonably possible while permitting reasonable economic use of the land  dexisting physical and natural systems such as but not limited to traffic drainage natural resources and parks will not be adversely affected any more than would occur if the development occurred as specified by the subject code standard  ethe hardship is not selfimposed  and fthe variance requested is the minimum variance which would alleviate the hardship   variance application and appeals the variance application shall conform to the requirements for type i ii or iii applications as applicable in addition the applicant shall provide a narrative or letter explaining the reason for hisher request alternatives considered and why the subject standard cannot be met without the variance appeals to variance decisions shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of this code  uses and developments nonconforming uses nonconforming development  nonconforming uses where at the time of adoption of this code a use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this code and was lawful at the time it was established the use may be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful provided aexpansion prohibited no such nonconforming use is enlarged increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land or space than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code no additional structure building or sign shall be constructed on the lot in connection with such nonconforming use of land blocation no such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code cdiscontinuation or abandonment the nonconforming use of land is not discontinued for any reason for a period of more than 12 months for purposes of calculating the 12month period a use is discontinued or abandoned upon the occurrence of the first of any of the following events 1on the date when the use of land is physically vacated  2on the date the use ceases to be actively involved in the sale of merchandise or the provision of services  3on the date of termination of any lease or contract under which the nonconforming use has occupied the land  or 4on the date a request for final reading of water and power meters is made to the applicable utility districts dapplication of standards if the use is discontinued or abandoned for any reason for a period of more than 12 months any subsequent use of land shall conform to the applicable standards and criteria specified by this code for the land use district in which such land is located   nonconforming development where a structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this title that could not be built under the terms of this title by reason of restrictions on lot area lot coverage height yard equipment its location on the lot or other requirements concerning the structure  and the structure was lawful when constructed the structure may remain on the site so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions ano such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity  but any structure or portion thereof may be enlarged up to 10 percent or altered in a way that satisfies the current requirements of the development code or will decrease its nonconformity  bshould such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed by any means to an extent more than 75 percent of its current value as assessed by the multnomah county assessor it shall be reconstructed only in conformity with the development code  and cshould such structure be moved for any reason and by any distance it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the development code   the fairview municipal current passed
