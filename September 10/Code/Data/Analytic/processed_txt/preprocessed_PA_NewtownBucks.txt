this minimize and control the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of its citizens  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of blight the board of supervisors has determined that licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to insure that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to insure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation the board of supervisors does not intend this suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment but intends to enact a content neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses legislative findings the board of supervisors finds sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects which should be regulated to protect the public health safety and welfare these secondary effects include but are not limited to the spread of communicable diseases performance of sexual acts in public places presence of discarded sexually oriented materials on public and private property sexual harassment obscenity prostitution and other illegal sexual activities crime and neighborhood deterioration a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the township it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein removal of doors on viewing booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths advances a substantial governmental interest in discouraging the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidents of certain types of  newtown township ecode360  231567 e f g h i j 1 2 criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business will help limit and control the adverse secondary effects of such businesses it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this barring of such individuals from the management of sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the township will be promoted by the enactment of this of operating hours sexually oriented businesses to  am to  pm mondays closure of such businesses on sunday and holidays reduces the adverse secondary effects of such businesses including particularly but not limited to late night noise levels crime and sexually offensive materials and activities in public areas and promotes the public health safety and welfare  13602 definitions 25200  602 as used in this

shall obtain funds for the township which are necessary to provide and coordinate roadway and intersection improvements which are necessary as the result of future development in the township the fee program was developed in order to prevent significant degradation of the level of traffic service as a result of new development throughout the township the program is designed to generate funding for future township road improvements necessary to accommodate in a safe and reasonable manner the traffic from new development throughout the township the program is not designed to solve existing traffic problems or to be a substitute for other ordinances pertaining to other required improvements definitions average daily trip generation rate the highest rate set forth in the latest edition of

township has caused an extensive townshipwide traffic circulation study to be prepared by the delaware valley regional planning commission which study has been adopted and approved by the board of supervisors of the township on the first day of august 198 as an amendment to the townships comprehensive plan the circulation study has confirmed that existing traffic flows in the township and those which are projected to be caused by developments which have already obtained final land development approval are adequate or will be made adequate as a result of funding previously obtained or to be obtained by the township in connection with said approvals or from other sources including but not limited to funds from federal state and local government the study has shown however comprehensive analysis of the projected townshipwide growth of residential and nonresidential uses and the traffic impact of such growth that specific traffic improvements will be required as a result of future development in the township the study has listed the need for and recommended specific improvements has estimated the construction cost and benefits to the traffic flows and otherwise identified issues affecting implementation of this offsite road improvement program in performing the study the traffic consultant has projected the offsite traffic improvements that will be required townshipwide as a result of future development in the township both residential and commercial and has allocated a fair prorata share of the needed additional offsite improvements among the projected future developments on a peak hour generation basis using this method and an adjustment factor for location the consultant has developed a fair share of contribution to be made by future developers to accommodate the need for offsite road improvements caused by said developments on a residential per unit basis and on a square footage basis for office andor retail space imposition of assessment there is hereby imposed upon all traffic generators in newtown township an assessment for the construction of necessary public improvements in accordance with the formula to be set forth below calculation of assessment the assessment imposed by this subsection upon all new traffic generators shall be determined by applying the unit improvement cost to the total new daily trips generated by a project to determine the fee for a specific use the total new daily trip generation for the proposed use shall be multiplied by the unit improvement cost the unit improvement cost will be set by resolution by the township board of supervisors and shall be updated at least every other year the resolution shall include the calculations necessary to determine the unit improvement cost special situations in the event a traffic generator is not sufficiently documented for traffic generation the assessment shall be determined estimation process using commonly accepted traffic engineering procedures an initial preliminary fee shall be calculated based upon estimated traffic and then adjusted not earlier than one year after the site is fully operational based upon actual daily traffic surveys establishment of fund there is hereby established a newtown township road improvement trust fund which shall be under the exclusive control of the board of supervisors of the township fees

419567 1 2 3 e f g h i the above equation assumes than one inch of rainfall falling on one acre of land falls at the rate of one cubic foot per second thus the total quantity of water falling on an area is represented by ia it is necessary to adjust the total quantity of water falling on an area ia because certain percentage of the water is dissipated by evaporation transpiration percolation ponding and physical characteristics such as sinkholes therefore the runoff factor c is introduced into the rational equation to account for the dissipated water the runoff factor c is a percentage factor which represents the proportion of the total quantity of water falling on the area that remains as runoff consideration should be given to future land use changes in the drainage area in

instance will an increase in gross or net density be permitted to exceed that which is obtainable under the standard provisions of the zoning roads standards for roads expressed in this are intended to provide for safe and intelligent layout of streets which can be maintained easily at minimum cost there are several aspects which may lead to the varying of size or design of specific streets road width the width of roads has been established to insure adequate movement of traffic in times of greatest parking loads where a road is designed so that all units face on secondary streets or courts and where overflow offstreet parking of at least 03 spaces per dwelling unit is provided nearby and contiguous to the roadway the road width may be reduced with this reduction the width may be no less than 28 feet on feeder streets or 20 feet on local streets curbs curbs are used to channel water to storm sewers protect pavement edges and keep vehicles off of grass in certain cases however natural drainage should be encouraged where topography and soils permit roadside swales may be substituted for curbs provided that the alternate design insures adequate means for the protection of pavement edges  handles storm water in a manner to insure against erosion or other conditions detrimental to the public health safety or welfare  and has the approval of the township engineer rightofway width rightofway width is intended to provide enough land for streets sidewalks walls and utilities it is intended to provide an additional buffer between the dwelling unit and the street where sidewalks are not run along streets cartways are reduced utilities are located outside of the rightofway or houses will not front on the street a reduction in the width of the rightofway may be permitted sidewalks sidewalks are intended to provide a separate means of movement for pedestrians in doing so the function of the sidewalk must be kept in mind the following provisions shall be met the walks shall be allweather and easily cleared of snow  they shall be convenient for the most frequent trips such as children walking to school bus stops  and the walks shall remain as private property and the responsibility for their maintenance shall be clearly established such as by a homeowners association in order for the township to waive the requirement for sidewalks to be within a street rightofway all the above provisions for locating sidewalks shall be met building spacing the requirement for building spacing or side yards as they are often defined is based on several related factors privacy the minimum building spacing requirement is intended to provide privacy within the dwelling unit where windows are placed in only one of two facing walls or there are no windows  or where the builder provides adequate screening for windows or where the windows are at such a height or location to provide adequate privacy the building spacing may be reduced at the discretion of the board of supervisors light and air the building spacing provides one method of insuring that each room has adequate light and air building spacing may be reduced at the discretion of the board of  newtown township ecode360  445567 3 d e f g h i supervisors where there are no windows or very small window areas and where rooms have adequate provisions for light and air from another direction or where building orientation layout and shapes are such that adequate light and air are available use areas between buildings are often used as service yards for storage of trash clotheslines or other utilitarian purposes where this use is similar for adjacent buildings a reduction of building space permitting effective design of a utility spacing may be permitted at the discretion of the board of supervisors kitchens and garages are suitable uses for rooms abutting such utility yards front yards the minimum front yard is intended to provide privacy and usable yard area for residents in practice however front yards are rarely used so that only the privacy factor is important where the developer provides privacy by reducing traffic flow layout such as culsdesac or by screening or planting or by facing the structure toward open space or a pedestrian way or arrangement of rooms and design of the front of the building it is possible to reduce the front yard requirement at the discretion of the board of supervisors lot width a minimum lot width is intended to prevent the construction of long narrow buildings with inadequate privacy light and air there are situations as in culsdesac steep slopes or offset lots where because of lot configuration or topography narrow or irregular lots provide the best possible design where the design is such that adequate light air and privacy can be provided especially for living spaces and bedrooms a narrower lot width may be permitted at the discretion of the board of supervisors building size or number of units in structure these requirements are intended to prevent monotony in developments in fact these requirements often prevent the land planner from utilizing interesting types of layout and working with unique site conditions  or they lead to a dull repetition of similar units where it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board of supervisors by presenting alternative plans that a superior and less monotonous plan will result by granting relief from these standards this may be done height limitations on height are often used to regulate the light available in limited yard areas and to prevent fire losses where inadequate firefighting equipment is available for the individual dwelling unit types only the former is important where unique site conditions and design permit height standards to be relaxed without adverse effects on light and air or privacy then this may be done at the discretion of the board of supervisors parking parking requirements are set for typical family situations only where subsidized housing for the elderly is being built shall these standards be relaxed where these standards are relaxed the township shall insist that adequate parking be provided at the owners expense if the buildings use is changed a notation to this effect shall be required on the plot plan lot size and coverage the required lot area for individual dwelling units is small to encourage the provision of housing at reasonable costs where larger dwellings or garages are provided larger lots are required if the plan and lot layout are good and the parking problem is properly solved then the onlot impervious surface ratio may be relaxed at the discretion of the board of supervisors  however the impervious surface ratio for the total site shall not be changed mobile home

newtown township finds that inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development and redevelopment throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including minimization of impacts of development redevelopment and activities causing accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the residents of newtown township and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment stormwater is an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality groundwater recharge stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems the most cost effective and environmentally advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is project design that minimizes impervious surfaces and sprawl avoids sensitive areas ie stream buffers floodplains steep slopes and considers topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime public education on the control of
