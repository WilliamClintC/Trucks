a new enlarged or replacement foundation is constructed under a nonconforming structure the structure and new foundation must be placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board or its designee basing its decision on the criteria specified in c3 relocation below 3 relocation a nonconforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board or its designee and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of state law and the state of maine subsurface wastewater disposal rules rules or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said rules in no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be more nonconforming in determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the planning board or its designee shall consider the size of the lot the slope of the land the potential for soil erosion the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties the location of the septic system and other onsite soils suitable for septic systems and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation when it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure the planning board shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation in accordance with s in addition the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation replanting shall be required as follows a trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree three 3 feet in height for every tree removed if more than five trees are planted no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland than the trees that were removed other woody and herbaceous vegetation and ground cover that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be reestablished an area at least the same size as the area where vegetation andor ground cover was disturbed damaged or removed must be reestablished within the setback area the vegetation andor ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation andor ground cover that was disturbed destroyed or removed b where feasible when a structure is relocated on a parcel the original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses shrubs trees or a combination thereof 4 reconstruction or replacement any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed or damaged or destroyed regardless of the cause by more than 50% of the market value of the structure before such damage destruction or removal may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained within eighteen 18 months of the date of said damage destruction or removal and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the water body tributary stream or wetland setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board or its designee in accordance with the purposes of this no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its nonconformity if the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure except as allowed pursuant to c1 above as determined by the nonconforming footprint of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location if the total footprint of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure when it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with c3 above any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value or damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the market value of the structure excluding normal maintenance and repair may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained from the officer within one year of such damage destruction or removal in determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the planning board or its designee shall consider in addition to the criteria in c3 above the physical condition and type of foundation present if any 5 change of use of a nonconforming structure the use of a nonconforming structure may not be changed to another use unless the planning board after receiving a written application determines that the new use will have no greater adverse impact on the water body tributary stream or wetland or on the

which is superseded by a conforming use may not again be devoted to a nonconforming use except that the planning board may for good cause shown by the applicant grant up to a one year extension to that time period this provision shall not apply to the resumption of a use of a residential structure provided that the structure has been used or maintained for residential purposes during the preceding five 5 year period 3 change of use an existing nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the proposed use has no greater adverse impact on the subject and

criteria specified in c3 relocation below 3 relocation a nonconforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board or its designee and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of state law and the state of maine subsurface wastewater disposal rules rules or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said rules in no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be more nonconforming in determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the planning board or its designee shall consider the size of the lot the slope of the land the potential for soil erosion the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties the location of the septic system and other onsite soils suitable for septic systems and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation when it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure the planning board shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation in accordance with s in addition the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation replanting shall be required as follows a trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree three 3 feet in height for every tree removed if more than five trees are planted no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland than the trees that were removed other woody and herbaceous vegetation and ground cover that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be reestablished an area at least the same size as the area where vegetation andor ground cover was disturbed damaged or removed must be reestablished within the setback area the vegetation andor ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation andor ground cover that was disturbed destroyed or removed b where feasible when a structure is relocated on a parcel the original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses shrubs trees or a combination thereof 4 reconstruction

cause by more than 50% of the market value of the structure before such damage destruction or removal may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained within eighteen 18 months of the date of said damage destruction or removal and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the water body tributary stream or wetland setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board or its designee in accordance with the purposes of this no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its nonconformity if the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure except as allowed pursuant to c1 above as determined by the nonconforming footprint of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location if the total footprint of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure when it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with c3 above any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value or damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the market value of the structure excluding normal maintenance and repair may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained from the officer within one year of such damage destruction or removal in determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the planning board or its designee shall consider in addition to the criteria in c3 above the physical condition and type of foundation present if any 5 change
