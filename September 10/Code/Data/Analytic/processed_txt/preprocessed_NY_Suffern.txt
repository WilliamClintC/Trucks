is hereby determined that a land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species c clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality g stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities h the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety i regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development 112 editors note this local law was originally adopted as a new ch 241 but was included as art i of ch 233 to maintain the organizational

see that a procedure is developed and carried out to notify and protect users of this piping system during the emergency and that special precautions are taken to disinfect thoroughly and flush out all pipelines which may become contaminated before they are again used to furnish drinking water in the event the means of protection of water consumers is by disinfection of the auxiliary firefighting supply the installation and its use shall be thoroughly reliable the public water supply must be protected against backflow from such dual domestic fire systems as detailed in of this

these regulations is not to transcend local plumbing regulations but only to deal with those extraordinary situations where sewage may be forced or drawn into the drinking water piping these regulations do not attempt to eliminate at this time the hazards of back siphonage valves on all toilets but deal with those situations where the likelihood of vacuum conditions in the drinking water system is definite and there is special danger to health devices suited to the purpose of avoiding back siphonage from plumbing fixtures are roof tanks barometric loops or separate pressure systems separately piped to supply such fixtures recognized approved vacuum or siphon breakers and other backflow protection devices which have been proved by appropriate tests to be dependable for destroying the vacuum 3 inasmuch as many serious hazards of this kind are due to water supply piping which is too small thereby causing vacuum conditions when fixtures are flushed or water is drawn from the system in other ways it is recommended that water supply piping that is too small be enlarged whenever possible f marking safe and unsafe waterlines 1 where the premises contain dual or multiple water systems and piping the exposed portions of pipelines shall be painted banded or marked at sufficient intervals to distinguish clearly which water is safe and which is not safe all outlets from
