general offenses seven  business regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that

from the duty to permit public inspection or copying from an item that otherwise meets the definition of a record in ohio rc  examples of redaction are blacking out or whiting out or cutting out portions of a document b when a public record contains information that is not within the definition of a public record as defined by law or is exempt by law the public records custodian or department will make available that portion of the public record that does meet the definition of a public record the public records custodian or department shall make a copy of the public record perform the redaction then make a copy of that sheet and make the second copy available to the requestor the requestor will not be charged for the first copy made if practical the first copy will be retained by the public records custodian or department 2 requests that are ambiguous overly broad or are difficult to identify the public records requested at times a requestor may make a public records request from which the public records custodian or department cannot determine which public records are being sought in such circumstances the public records custodian or department will inform the requestor that the public records request is denied but will give the requestor an opportunity to more accurately describe the public records sought if the requestor is seeking public records organized in a certain way but the public records are not organized in that way the public records custodian or department will inform the requestor of the manner that the public records of the office under discussion are maintained and accessed the requestor may then submit a public records request that more accurately reflects the actual organization of the public records sought d compliance the public records custodian or department reserves the right to consult with legal counsel prior to the release of any public records this is to allow the village to comply with laws regarding the release of
