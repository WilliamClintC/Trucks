forth in mmc  numerical values such as those listed in mmc  or a combination of both expressed as best management practices bmps 40 cfr 4035c4 historically bmps only applied to groups of lowflow discharges that had similar processes and discharged similar types of wastewater eg photo processors and dentist offices however with the recent lowering of indirect discharge limitations and improved analytical methods the city will begin using bmps in cases where it is not practical or economically feasible for an industrial user to monitor for or attain specific numerical pretreatment limits this section gives the city the ability to shift from numerical endofpipe chemical controls on an industrial user to bmps and pollution prevention as an effective way for the city to achieve compliance with npdes permit limits bmps are enforceable under 40 cfr 4035d b bmp use examples 1 there is insufficient flow from an industrial user or a category of industrial users to obtain a representative wastewater sample eg dentist offices photo processors 2 the proposed local limit is less than the detection limit andor quantification level 40 cfr  of the most stringent analytical procedure 3 the bmp is clearly the most economically feasible method for regulating the pollutant of concern c bmp removal from permit the city may consider a request to remove the bmp requirement from the indirect discharge permit if the permittee can demonstrate that the discharge is reasonably expected to meet the numeric local limit in cases where the numeric local limit is calculated to be negative and where the industrys effluent sampling results for pollutants with bmp requirements are below the quantification level the city may also consider a permit modification request relaxation of the permit conditions does not allow the industry to return to its previous methods of operation d inspections monitoring and numeric effluent limits may still be required by the city to verify that the industry remains in compliance at a minimum a certification statement is required certifying that the industry is operating under its approved bmp and no changes have been implemented e bmps may be used in the discretion of the city where appropriate to meet such pretreatment standards in a practical and economic fashion f industrial users subject to bmps as a means of complying with standards of this part shall maintain documentation to demonstrate compliance with all bmp standards for the term of the permit or five years whichever is longer   industrial wastewater discharge

average monthly consumption for the four months of january february march and december all for 1987 3 allocation goals for irrigation service accounts accounts classified for irrigation will be forty percent of the actual consumption for the same period in 1987 where 1987 actual consumption data are not available the director shall establish an appropriate allocation using relevant parameters and reflecting the equivalent of a sixty percent reduction from normal irrigation 4 allocation goals for new accounts initial allocations for new singlefamily residences and duplex accounts will be established at twelve units per billing cycle initial allocations for new multiplefamily accounts such as apartments condominiums triplexes and others will be established at ten units per billing cycle final allocations for singlefamily residence accounts will be calculated on the number of documented residents within a household allocations for the first two residents for singlefamily residence accounts will be established at seventyfive gallons per day each and fiftyfive gallons per day for each subsequent resident final allocations for multiplefamily residences will be established at fiftyfive gallons per day for each documented resident in the case of commercial or industrial customers business data supplied to the director will be the basis for establishing the allocation 5 allocation goals where no past history exists when water records for calendar year 1987 are not available do not exist for all or various portions of the year or do not allow or provide

only   1976 22  variance procedure the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structures its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council of the city of millbrae to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring structures built below the flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate   1976 23  variance appeal board a in passing upon applications for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and all of the following 1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner and future owners of the property  4 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 the availability of alternate locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the san mateo county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land the notice shall indicate that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property c the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appealvariance actions including justification for their issuance and report any variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency   1976 24  condition for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures in mmc  have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in mmc  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall only be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if no increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to elevation requirements this means the city council of the city of millbrae need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local chapter e variances shall only be issued upon 1 a showing of good cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in mmc  to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance would not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in mmc   see public nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in mmc  of the public or conflict with local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependant use provided that the provisions of mmc  satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance g upon consideration of the factors of mmc  and the purposes of this chapter the city council of the city of millbrae may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter   1976 25  administrative policy and procedure 119 this policy and

that are reasonably necessary because of the local climatic geological andor topographical conditions the foregoing amendments to the building code are based on the following findings and local conditions which make the changes in the building code reasonably necessary 1 the unique characteristics of topography and the balance of industrial commercial and residential property in the city of millbrae require modifications to the california building to protect the health safety and welfare of the residents and property in the city by setting standards and requirements and to give the city more control in ensuring these standards and requirements are met 2 millbrae is located in an earthquake zone has a moist climate and the land throughout millbrae involves large quantities of fill because of these and other factors the land in the city is subject to instability furthermore millbrae generally has hilly terrain high winds and buildings in close proximity to each other which can increase the risk of the spreading of fires millbraes tight traffic patterns and poor access to fires limit fire fighting capabilities when fires start 3 more specifically the amendments to the following sections of the building code are based on these particular findings a this section has been added to balance the interests of construction contractors in performing construction contracts and the interests of the residents in the community from being disturbed in the early morning and late evening hours b this section has been added to meet the requirements of the noise insulation standards established by the federal aviation administration the standards are intended to reduce the noise level produced from the san francisco international airport and to ensure that future residential new construction additions and remodels comply with these standards c this section has been added to meet the requirements of the consent decree between the city and the san francisco baykeeper with an effective date of  4 climatic conditions the city on an average experiences an annual rainfall of sixteen inches to eighteen inches this rainfall can be expected between october and april of each year however during the summer months there is little if any measurable precipitation during this dry period the temperatures are usually between seventy and ninety degrees with light to gusty westerly winds these drying winds mixed with natural vegetation and neighborhoods of predominately wood and wood shingle residential dwellings create a hazardous fuel condition with more and more development winddriven fires would have severe consequences as has been demonstrated on several occasions in other areas of the state because of the weather patterns a normal rainfall cannot always be relied upon this can result in water rationing and water allocation systems as demonstrated by the drought years of 1987 water shortages can also be expected in the future due to the current water storage capacities and increased consumption 5 geological conditions the citys western boundary is within a few miles of the san andreas fault one of the major seismic faults running an earthquake along the san andreas fault or along any of the other numerous seismic faults elsewhere in the bay area could break gas electrical and water lines increasing the chance of fires and impairing the ability to fight them experts have cautioned that one or more major earthquakes in the bay area are inevitable and will probably happen sometime in the next several decades 6 topographical conditions the findings of fact for the topographical elements as would be expected are closely associated with the geographical element the elevation in the city changes from sea level on the east boundary to six hundred eightyfive feet on the west because of these elevation changes narrow streets with steep grades weave upper residential sections of the city onstreet parking and excessive setbacks create long narrow driveways which extend the response time of fire equipment and other emergency services as a result of the findings of fact which define the various climatic geological and topographical elements those additional requirements as specified in these amendments by the city of millbrae are considered reasonable and necessary modifications while it is clearly

 findings health and safety 5 and 179587 authorizes the city to make more restrictive amendments that are reasonably necessary because of the local climatic geological andor topographical conditions the foregoing amendments are based on the following findings and local conditions that make the changes in the fire code reasonably necessary a the unique characteristics of the topography and the balance of industrial commercial and residential property in the city requires modifications to the 2016 fire code to protect the health safety and welfare of the residents and property in the city b specific amendments more restrictive than in those adopted by the state of california have been established to address the fire problems concerns and future direction by which the city can establish and maintain an environment which will afford a level of fire and life safety to all who live and work within its boundaries these amendments are based on specific climatic geographical and topographical conditions present in the city as more specifically described below 1 climatic conditions the city on an average experiences an annual rainfall of sixteen inches to eighteen inches this rainfall can be expected between october and april of each year however during the summer months there is little if any measurable precipitation during this dry period the temperatures are usually between seventy and ninety degrees with light to gusty westerly winds these drying winds mixed with natural vegetation and neighborhoods of predominately wood and wood shingle residential dwellings create a hazardous fuel condition with more and more development winddriven fires would have severe consequences as has been demonstrated on several occasions in other areas of the state because of the weather patterns a normal rainfall cannot always be relied upon this can result in water rationing and water allocation systems as demonstrated by the drought years of 1987 water shortages can also be expected in the future due to the current water storage capacities and increased consumption 2 geological conditions the citys western boundary is within a few miles of the san andreas fault one of the major seismic faults running an earthquake along the san andreas fault or along any of the other numerous seismic faults elsewhere in the bay area could break gas electrical and water lines increasing the chance of fires and impairing the ability to fight them experts have cautioned that one or more major earthquakes in the bay area are inevitable and will probably happen sometime in the next several decades 3 topographical conditions the findings of fact for the topographical elements as would be expected are closely associated with the geographical element the elevation in the city changes from sea level on the east boundary to six hundred eightyfive feet on the west because of these elevation changes narrow streets with steep grades weave upper residential sections of the city onstreet parking and excessive setbacks create long narrow driveways which extends the response time of fire equipment and other emergency services as a result of the findings of fact which define the various climatic geological and topographical elements those additional requirements as specified in these amendments by the city of millbrae are considered reasonable and necessary modifications while it is clearly understood that the adoption of such regulations may not prevent the incidence of disasters the implementation of these amendments to the code may reduce the severity and potential of loss of life and property  amended by    formerly  california green building code adoption of the california green building edition s note of provides this ordinance shall be in full force and

mixed use zoning districts where residential developments of five or more dwelling units are proposed and where the applicant seeks and agrees to provide low very low senior or moderate income housing units in the threshold amounts specified in state density bonus law such that the resulting density is beyond that which is permitted by the applicable zoning this chapter and state density bonus law shall apply only to the residential component of a mixeduse project and shall not operate to increase the allowable density of the nonresidential component of any proposed project 2 nothing in this chapter requires the provision of direct financial incentives for the residential development including but not limited to the provision of financial subsidies publicly owned land fee waivers or waiver of dedication requirements the city at its sole discretion may choose to provide such direct financial incentives 3 financial and certain other incentives may require payment of prevailing wages by the residential development if required by state law 4 unless otherwise specified in this chapter the definitions found in state density bonus law shall apply to the terms contained herein c procedure 1 application requirements a any applicant requesting a density bonus incentives andor waivers pursuant to state density bonus law shall provide the city with a written proposal the proposal shall be submitted prior to or concurrently with filing the planning application for the housing development and shall be processed in conjunction with the underlying application b the proposal for a density bonus incentives andor waivers pursuant to state density bonus law shall include the following information i the specific requested density bonus proposal shall demonstrate that the project meets the thresholds for the state density bonus law the proposal shall also include calculations showing the maximum base density the numberpercentage of affordable units and identification of the income level at which such units will be restricted additional market rate units resulting from the density bonus allowable under state density bonus law and the resulting unit per acre density the density bonus units shall not be included in determining the percentage of base units that qualify a project for a density bonus pursuant to state density bonus law ii requested incentives the request for particular incentives shall include a pro forma or other report demonstrating that the requested incentives results in identifiable financially sufficient and actual cost reductions that are necessary to make the housing units economically feasible the report shall be sufficiently detailed to allow the city to verify its conclusions if the city requires the services of specialized financial consultants to review and corroborate the analysis the applicant will be liable for all costs incurred in reviewing the documentation iii requested waivers the written proposal shall include an explanation of the waivers of development standards requested and why they are necessary to make the construction of the project physically possible any requested waivers shall not exceed the limitations provided by subsection c5 of this section and to the extent such limitations are exceeded will be considered as a request for an incentive iv fee payment of the fee in an amount set by resolution of the city council to reimburse the city for staff time spent reviewing and processing the state density bonus law application submitted pursuant to this chapter 2 density bonus a a density bonus for a housing development means a density increase over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the applicable zoning and land use designation on the date the

council may approve a density bonus andor incentives in accordance with state density bonus law for a project that does not maximize the underlying base zoning density additionally nothing herein prevents the city from granting a greater density bonus and additional incentives or waivers than that provided for herein or from providing a lesser density bonus and fewer incentives and waivers

combined with the density bonus provided pursuant to any other provisions of this chapter 3 incentives a the number of incentives granted shall be based upon the number the applicant is entitled to pursuant to state density bonus law b an incentive includes a reduction in site development standards or a modification of zoning code requirements or architectural requirements that result in identifiable financially sufficient and actual cost reductions an incentive may be the approval of mixed use zoning eg commercial in conjunction with a housing project if the mixed use will reduce the cost of the housing development and is compatible with the housing project an incentive may but need not be the provision of a direct financial incentive such as the waiver of fees c a requested incentive may be denied only for those reasons provided in state density bonus law denial of an incentive is a separate and distinct act from a decision to deny or approve the entirety of the project 4 discretionary approval the granting of a density bonus or incentives shall not be interpreted in and of itself to require a general plan amendment zoning change or other discretionary approval if an incentive would otherwise trigger one of these approvals when it is granted as an incentive no general plan amendment zoning change or other discretionary approval is required however if the base project without the incentive requires a general plan amendment zoning change or other discretionary approval the city retains discretion to make or not make the required findings for approval of the base project 5 waivers a waiver is a modification to a development standard such that construction at the increased density would be physically possible modifications to floor area ratio in an amount equivalent to the percentage density bonus utilized shall be allowable as a waiver requests for an increase in floor area ratio above that equivalent percentage shall be considered a request for an incentive other development standards include but are not limited to a height limitation a setback requirement an onsite open space requirement or a parking ratio that applies to a residential
