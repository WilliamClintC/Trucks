interest beginning with supplement no 14 municipal will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation during original codification the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of book publishing company under the direction of douglas barnes city attorney the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 14 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a subjectmatter index with complete crossreferencing locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers

code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the

the purpose of this chapter is to regulate adult businesses to promote the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city of montebello the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials it is recognized that adult businesses have a serious deleterious effect upon adjacent areas as well as the areas in which they are located it is therefore the purpose of this chapter to establish standards for the conduct of adult businesses which will protect the public health safety and welfare preserve locally recognized values of community appearance minimize the potential for nuisances related to the operation of adult businesses and maintain local property values in approving the licensing regulations contained in this chapter the city council has reviewed detailed studies reports and letters prepared by other jurisdictions and its own staff with respect to the detrimental social health and economic effects on persons and properties surrounding adult businesses these studies included upland california 1992  garden grove california 1991  tucson arizona 1990  seattle washington 1989  austin texas 1986  oklahoma city oklahoma 1986  indianapolis indiana 1984  houston texas 1983  beaumont texas 1982  minneapolis minnesota 1980  phoenix arizona 1979  whittier california 1978  amarillo texas 1977  cleveland ohio 1977  los angeles california 1977  state of minnesota attorney general report 1989  newport news virginia 1996  st paul minnesota 1987  corpus christi texas 1995  and national law center 1995 collectively studies the studies substantiate the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses a based on the foregoing studies and the other evidence presented the city council finds that 1 adult businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates in those areas in which they are located and that surround them  and 2 both the proximity of adult businesses to sensitive land uses and the concentration of adult businesses tend to result in the blighting and downgrading of the areas in which they are located 3 unregulated adult businesses create serious public health concerns and hazards since the studies and cases demonstrate that such businesses have been linked to the spread of communicable and sexuallytransmitted diseases 4 special regulation of adult businesses is necessary to ensure that their adverse secondary effects will not contribute to an increase in the crime rates or the blighting

safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss  1998 prior code  90012   purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote public

ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  1998 prior code  90013   content and provisions in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve as such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channel and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas  1998 prior code  90014   applicability this chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards and areas of

in this section are based on the general principal of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristics must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners b it is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if the variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  1998  part 1992 prior code  90061   variancesappeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of use and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency  1998  part 1992 prior code  90061 part   variancesconditions a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in this chapter to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance g upon consideration of the factors of the purpose of this chapter the city may attach such

larger parcels of land in residential commercial and manufacturing zones where the existing underlying development standards do not functionally allow for reasonable development this master planning mechanism allows for a comprehensive approach to development on a single parcel or contiguous parcels of land under single or joint ownership and allow for flexibility in land use controls typically required by another zoning designation the planned development mechanism encourages the use of modern planning and development techniques thereby ensuring more efficient utilization of land in the community an approved planned development will be designated on the official zoning map with a pd designation a precise plan of development the plan shall be adopted along with the pd designation as the implementation tool for the planned development  part 2006   purpose a plan development district designation is a reasonably flexible development tool that a provides for sound and efficient development of a parcel or parcels of land with unique topographic land features andor having irregular shape andor parcels affected by incompatible land uses on adjacent properties  b insures the preservation of natural land features open space and other valuable and desirable environmental features of a particular area  c allows the development of large residential commercial and industrial projects in such a manner to insure that such proposed development is consistent with the elements of the general plan any applicable specific plan and to assure that such development will be compatible with surrounding existing and proposed land uses  d reduces or eliminates the rigidity delays and inequities that otherwise may result from the application of land use regulations and administrative procedures designed for small parcels of land  e allows for mixeduse commercialresidential development in such a manner as to insure that such proposed development is consistent with the elements of the general plan any applicable specific plan and to assure that such development will be compatible with surrounding existing and proposed land uses  f encourages architectural design diversity and avoids monotony in large developments by allowing greater freedom in the design of architectural elements to provide access light open space and amenities in an aesthetically pleasing manner  g provides for maintenance of the open space for those who will directly benefit from it  h encourages the assembly of properties that might otherwise be developed in unrelated increments to

regulations   findings it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to provide for the reasonable and uniform regulation of adult businesses in the city it is recognized that adult businesses have a serious deleterious effect upon adjacent areas as well as the areas in which they are located it is therefore the purpose of this chapter to establish criteria and standards for the establishment and conduct of adult businesses which will protect the public health safety and welfare preserve locally recognized values of community appearance minimize the potential for nuisances related to the operation of adult businesses and maintain local property values it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to establish proper regulations and to provide for a reasonable number of approximately located sites for adult businesses within the city based upon the following findings a the city council has reviewed the detailed studies reports and letters prepared by other jurisdictions and its own staff with respect to the detrimental social health and economic effects on persons and properties surrounding adult businesses these studies included upland california 1992  garden grove california 1991  tucson arizona 1990  seattle washington 1989  austin texas 1986  oklahoma city oklahoma 1986  indianapolis indiana 1984  houston texas 1983  beaumont texas 1982  minneapolis minnesota

 st paul minnesota 1987  corpus christi texas 1995  and national law center 1995  collectively studies the studies substantiate the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses b based on the foregoing studies and the other evidence presented the city council finds that 1 adult businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates of those areas in which they are located and that surround them  and 2 both the proximity of adult businesses to sensitive land uses and the concentration of adult businesses tend to result in the blighting and downgrading of the areas in which they are located c the studies conducted in various communities in other jurisdictions have demonstrated that the proximity and concentration of adult businesses adjacent to residential recreational religious educational or other adult businesses can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere d the studies conducted in various communities in other jurisdictions have demonstrated that adult businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates and blighting of those areas in which they are located and that surround them e the special regulation of adult businesses is necessary to ensure that their adverse secondary effects will not contribute to an increase in the crime rates or the blighting or downgrading of the areas in which they are located or surrounding areas the need for the special regulation is based on the recognition that adult businesses have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or located in direct proximity with sensitive uses such as residential zones and uses parks schools churches or day care centers thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas f it is the purpose and intent of these special regulations to prevent the concentration or location of adult businesses in a manner that would create such adverse secondary effects thus in order to protect and preserve the public health safety and welfare of the citizenry especially including minors the special regulation of the time place and manner of the location and operation of adult businesses is necessary g the protection and preservation of the public health safety and welfare require that certain distances be maintained between adult businesses and residential uses and zones churches schools day care centers parks and other adult businesses h the need to regulate the proximity of adult businesses to sensitive land uses such as residential religious educational recreational and other adult businesses are documented in studies conducted by other jurisdictions as listed elsewhere in this section i the report of the state of minnesota attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses dated  indicated that 1 community impacts of sexually oriented businesses are primarily a function of two variables proximity to residential areas and concentration property values are directly affected within a small radius typically one block of the location of a sexually oriented business concentration may compound depression of property values and may lead to an increase of crime sufficient to change the quality of life and perceived desirability of property in a neighborhood  and 2 the impacts of sexually oriented businesses are exacerbated when they are located near each other when sexually oriented businesses have multiple uses ie theater bookstore nude dancing peep booths one building can have the impact of several separate businesses j in consideration of the findings of the report of the state of minnesota attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses dated  it is appropriate to prohibit the concentration of multiple adult businesses within one building in order to mitigate the compounded adverse secondary effects associated with such concentrations as described above k the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexuallyoriented materials that are protected by the first amendment of the united states constitution and the relevant provisions of the california state constitution l the proposed parking standards are necessary in the interests of the public health safety and welfare to provide for an appropriate amount of offstreet parking m the city council takes legislative notice of the penal authorizing local governments to regulate matter that is harmful to minors eg penal et seq the city council further takes legislative notice of cases that recognize that protection of minors from sexually explicit materials is a
