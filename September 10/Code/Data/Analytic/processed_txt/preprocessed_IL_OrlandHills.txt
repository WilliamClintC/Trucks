document has been prepared by the flood protection planning committee to identify ongoing public information activities and recommend new ones to better inform our residents on how they can protect themselves from flood and drainage problems res 9825 passed 7198  15341 flood hazard aorland hills drainage system is subject to four flood problems these were described in the 1995 flood protection plan 1a overbank flooding from tinley creek and its tributary highview ditch tinley creek is the main drainageway hills when orland hills was developed in the 1960s the channel was straightened and deepened so it would carry water more efficiently in one section it was rerouted to follow lot lines much of the creeks flood problems can be traced to the alterations made to what was once a natural drainageway bproperty lines run to the middle of the channel most property owners maintain their parts of the channel bank although some do not in some areas weeds and brush have been allowed to grow rocks placed as rip rap on the banks have been moved to the channel bottom apparently by children the worst problem in the channel is the condition of some of the culverts they are so small that they act as dams even when clear over time debris collects in them rip rap is moved to block them and they suffer from wear and tear call of these factors mean that the carrying capacity of the channel has been reduced it takes less water to fill the channel and cause overbank flooding than it used to the result has been street and yard flooding erosion of the channel banks and some building flooding 2overbank flooding from midlothian creek headwaters the southeast portion of orland hills drains into the headwaters of midlothian creek the mapped 100year floodplain is substantially on public property streets or back yards however the floodplain does fill with water and has caused nuisance flooding in streets and yards 3underdesigned or obstructed storm sewers storm sewers have been installed in some areas of town to augment the surface drainage system storm sewers wont work if they are underdesigned or when they are blocked there are several known examples of blockages the prime impact of storm sewer problems is water in the streets and yards 4a yard drainage problems when subdivisions are laid out for development a five or ten foot easement or set back is established when the lot is built on there should be no construction in this easement a shallow depression or swale is kept along the lot lines the swale guides stormwater runoff to the street or storm sewer bover the years this drainage system has been disrupted many property owners are not aware of the need to keep their easements and swales open they installed sheds planters railroad ties or swimming pools in the easements they built fences right on their lot lines to enclose the largest part of their properties cearly homes in orland hills especially homes on crawl spaces were built at the original ground level later home builders especially for trilevels added fill around the lots this provided positive drainage from the lot protected the lower areas from drainage problems and improved the appearance of the site dnow when it rains the runoff goes downhill to the lowest point the older buildings that did not backflow or raise their lots directing downspouts and sump pump discharge pipes toward the property line aggravates the water problem that the lower owner receives often the first property developed becomes the recipient of runoff as later builders fill in their lots ein at least one new area the back yards were set aside as detention areas property owners have already cut into the berms built fences and otherwise modified these detention areas not only is their future effectiveness in question but the owners may start complaining when they see a lot of water staying in their yards even though that is where it is supposed to be fbad yard drainage occurs throughout orland hills in new subdivisions and in the original town it can have as much of an impact as overbank flooding sometimes the result is a nuisance such as a soaked backyard however either shallow water on the surface or saturated ground can cause flooding several feet deep on a floor that is below grade some trilevels in orland hills do not have finished lower areas because of chronic flooding from bad yard drainage bin sum the villages flood and drainage problems occur throughout town they are primarily the result of manmade alterations to or a lack of maintenance of the drainage system usually on the part of the adjacent property owners the village has done a lot to improve this system since 1995 we have initiated a formal drainage maintenance program and installed larger culverts we have a better permit enforcement program than before we have distributed information and staff talks to residents about flooding and drainage cas a result of these efforts the number of complaints has decreased and residents have become more aware of how problems occur and what their role should be since the bulk of the problem is caused by people andor negligence a public information program directed to residents can go a long way to prevent and reduce flood problems res 9825 passed 7198  15342 flood safety and protection measures aflooding in orland hills usually comes quickly during or after a heavy storm flood depths are shallow but people should take safety precautions such as staying out of flooded areas and turning off the electricity in a flooded house bpeople can best protect themselves and their properties by maintaining their yards drainage swales ditches and streets reporting violations of the dumping regulations and carrying flood andor sewer backup insurance cother protection measures depend on the type of foundation 1split levels trilevels and buildings with basements can be protected with sump pumps and sewer backup protection measures such as overhead sewer lines 2slab foundation buildings subject to shallow flooding can be protected by dry floodproofing or low barriers 3buildings on crawlspaces can be protected by barriers wet floodproofing or elevation res 9825 passed 7198  15343 current public information activities the villages public information activities were recommended by the flood protection plan and formalized as part of its community rating system crs program the following activities are conducted athe building department provides map information based on the flood insurance rate map and the engineers gis version of it barticles on flooding and flood protection are carried periodically in the village newsletter over the period of a year 9 of the 10 crs credited topics are covered 1flood hazard 2flood hazard map 3flood safety 4flood insurance 5property protection 6permit requirements 7substantial improvement regulations 8drainage maintenance 9natural and beneficial floodplain functions cthe village has two 12page booklets guide to flood protection and guide to basement flooding copies of guide to flood protection are sent out to all 132 floodplain residents each april it covers the same nine topics as the newsletter articles dcopies of guide to flood protection and guide to basement flooding are on display in the village hall for anyone to take eadditional references are on file at the library fthe building commissioner is advertised as available to talk to residents who want help with flood drainage or sewer backup protection he talks to five to ten residents each month gthe village assisted with a floodproofing open house held in the next community in may 1997 three faces registered two of whom had been flooded in february 1997 and july 1996 res 9825 passed 7198  15344 goals the goals of this public information program strategy are in order of importance ahave all residents familiar with the causes of local flood and drainage problems and the steps they can take to prevent or reduce the problems bhave all residents familiar with the reasons for and regulations about dumping and alterations to watercourses and yard swales chave all residents familiar with basic flood safety and health precautions dhave all residents familiar with flood and sewer backup insurance res 9825 passed 7198  15345 recommended public information activities athe villages public information program is based on three guiding principles 1face to face communication is more effective than distributing written materials or using electronic media it allows for sitespecific explanations and examples and it provides feedback on whether the recipient understands the message 2prevention is better than correction flooding and drainage in the village are currently well managed as long as people realize how problems are caused and they dont create more problems the more staff contacts there are on flood or drainage issues the more staff will find out about potential problems before they are created 3the program should focus on one or two simple messages at a time it should not overwhelm residents with complicated explanations of many different aspects about flooding and flood protection bwith these guiding principles in mind the following activities are recommended 1the activities currently being implemented and receiving crs credit should be continued they have proved useful 2each year the village will identify the major flood protection message that will be disseminated during staff contacts with residents athese contacts include but are not limited to applications for building permits site inspections inquiries on flood map information and resident complaints about water or sewer problems bvillage trustees are encouraged to repeat the message in their contacts with the public ca onepage flyer will be prepared for each message to reinforce the verbal message and provide an explanation that people can take with them the flyers will be provided to school children too dthe message will be repeated periodically on the public access cable tv channel 3the message for 1998 is dont forget your drainage athe message will advise residents 1of the causes and effects of not caring for local drainage 2how their yard drains 3to not obstruct the drainage with sheds swimming pools planters and the like 4to keep their storm sewer inlets cleared and 5to call the village if they see a problem bthe building department puts stickers on permits to remind the applicant of key permit requirements permits for sheds swimming pools and other projects that can alter yard drainage will have a sticker that reads there shall be no alteration of any drainage system or swales on the permit property andor surrounding properties cthe onepage flyer on the message will be included with building permits and other appropriate village communications to residents 4the message for 1999 will be on protecting basements from sump pump failure and sewer backup messages for future years will be decided during the february evaluation meeting of the flood protection planning committee 5at its february evaluation meeting the flood protection planning committee will finalize plans for an annual spring flood awareness month aduring that month the new flood protection message will be introduced and repeated media including cable tv notices and the village newsletter bthe annual mailing to floodplain residents will be done during the month cthe village hall counter the library and the schools will be encouraged to set up displays on flood protection and distribute the flyer on the years message res 9825 passed 7198  15346 monitoring and evaluation the building commissioner will report on the implementation of the recommended public information activities to each meeting of the flood protection planning committee at its february meeting the committee will evaluate their effectiveness and include its findings and recommendations with its annual progress report to the board of

security for the guarantees passed 4677 penalty see  15699 appendix d storm water detention  standard specifications ageneral it is recognized that the receiving streams and storm sewers within the area of the village do not have the capacity to receive and convey the increased storm water runoff resulting from rapid urbanization occurring in the village and adjacent areas these receiving streams and storm sewers are subject to frequent flooding which results in a growing rate of property damage it is the intent of this specification that detention storage of storm water be provided to eliminate the excessive storm water runoff caused by the reduction or elimination of previous land surfaces construction of buildings parking lots streets and other improvements to real estate brequirements a building permit will not be issued unless the applicant provides onsite detention of storm water runoff or participates in the provision of a village approved regional detention facility as set forth in the following criteria 1a combination of storage and controlled release of storm water runoff is required for all residential developments exceeding five acres in the area for all residential developments of less than five acres which have an impervious area of 50% or greater for all nonresidential developments exceeding two acres in area and for all nonresidential developments of less than two acres which have an impervious area of 50% or greater however a residential development of five acres or less and a nonresidential development of two acres or less must have an adequate outlet as signified by the village engineer if the outlet is not adequate then detention as determined by the village engineer will be required to store that portion of the runoff exceeding the outlet capacity 2the release rate of storm water from all developments requiring detention shall not exceed the storm water runoff rate from the area of 015 cfs per acre abecause of the flat conditions of the land in this area channel configurations cut by nature are generally unable to handle the runoff from high intensity rainfalls and results in flood plain storage or spreading of runoff over the land areas during the larger storm periods in order not to increase the runoff from such areas after development the release rate must be limited to carrying capacity of these natural channels bthe village will accept the release rate of not greater than that calculated from a storm of threeyear frequency with a runoff rate coefficient of 015 threeyear frequency storm of two hour duration or 100year frequency storm of fourhour duration unless the applicant can show by his detail calculations which are acceptable by the village that the discharge rate of the natural outlet channel serving the area is greater in the event the downstream channel capacities are less than the above specified release rates the release rates from the proposed area shall be reduced to match that available downstream capacity 3drainage systems shall have adequate capacity to bypass development the flow from all upstream areas for a storm of design frequency assuming that the land is in a fully developed state under present zoning or zoning proposed under the official plan the bypass flow rate shall be computed utilizing a runoff coefficient of not less than 035 an allowance will be made for upstream detention when such upstream detention and release rate has previously been approved by the village and evidence of its construction can be shown 4the detention volume required shall be that necessary to handle the runoff of a 100year rainfall for any and all durations from the fully developed drainage area tributary to the reservoir less that volume discharged during the same duration at the approved release rate the live detention storage to be provided shall be calculated on the basis of the 100year and threeyear frequency rainfalls as published by the us weather bureau for the chicago area 5detention facilities for developments within the village shall be subject to the approval of the metropolitan sanitary district of greater chicago the approval of the village
