growth is expected to occur in the areas that are provided water and wastewater utility services by the city 2 growth within the service area has resulted in the need to expand the water production and distribution system to expand the wastewater transmission system and to negotiate available treatment purchased capacity with the city of hollywood to accommodate the demands imposed by such growth without decreasing the current level of utility services at the cost of existing users 3 expansion of water and wastewater utility services to accommodate new growth shall promote and protect the interests and general welfare of the residents of hallandale beach 4 in order for future growth to pay more equitably the cost of expanding the water production and distribution system and the wastewater system to meet the demands imposed by such growth the city commission finds that the adoption of water and wastewater impact fees to be levied as onetime charges upon new users connections or new demand on the system created or renovations is an appropriate and equitable method of capital cost recovery 5 the intent of the water and wastewater impact fees is to recover only the pro rata

logic imagination innovation and variety in project design to preserve protect and supplement the existing natural environment to ensure that urban services delivery systems are not unduly overburdened by excessive or premature development and to determine that all development occurs in full conformity to the county land use plan and when adopted the city comprehensive plan and elements of the plan app a art vii  1 applicability a review procedures all applications for a development permit within the city shall be subject to development review procedures including both site plan review and impact evaluation applications shall be classified as either of a minor or major nature for the purposes of determining procedural review and approval responsibilities the following classifications are established 1 minor development minor developments shall include those which contain less than ten residential dwelling units or less than 4000 square feet of nonresidential gross floor area and shall be subject only to staff review and approval 2 major development major developments shall include those which contain ten residential dwelling units or more or 4000 square feet of nonresidential gross floor area or more and shall be subject to review by staff and the planning and zoning board and review and approval by the city commission 3 major development with administrative review certain development applications in the central rac zoning district that would otherwise qualify as major developments are subject only to staff review and approval  see section 32205a 4 division of proposed developments prohibited applicants may not divide or phase developments to avoid being subject to major development classification if an applicant obtains approval for a minor development and within two years from that approval that applicant or his successor in interest submits another application for a development permit on the same parcel of property that together with the previously approved development would qualify as a major development then the entire project including that portion previously approved shall be subject to the requirements for major developments b development permits other than building permits the purpose of this subsection is to provide a process for conducting the required development review of applications for development permits that do not contain a complete specific site development proposal for example applications for rezoning or plat approval frequently do not submit detailed site plans and specific site development information however the impact evaluation portion of the development review process must review a specific development proposal therefore applications for development permits that do not include a complete specific site development proposal shall for impact evaluation purposes be presumed to be the most intense development permitted under the applicable land development regulations if different permitted uses in the applicable regulations have different impacts upon the services or facilities to be evaluated the most intense impact on each separate service or facility shall be presumed the applicable land development regulations may refer where the context is appropriate to either the current regulations or as in a rezoning or variance the regulations as proposed to be amended or varied if the applicant submits a complete specific site development proposal meeting all submission requirements for both site plan approval and impact evaluation as part of his application for a development permit that application will be evaluated on the basis of that proposal if the applicant for a rezoning variance or plat approval submits a specific proposed use but does not submit a complete site development proposal impact evaluation of the rezoning shall focus on that proposed use if he subsequently submits an application for building permits for a use other than and in any aspect more intense than that submitted proposed use he shall be subject to a new complete impact evaluation process as well as full site plan review further if the requested development permit is granted based upon a complete specific site development proposal then a subsequent application for building permits shall not be subject to a new site plan and impact evaluation process and approval subject to the following 1 the director may approve that subsequent application if he determines that a there has not been any material and substantial change in the conditions existing at the time of the development permit approval  b the building permit application is in strict conformity with the complete specific site development permit  and c the subsequent application for a building permit is made within one year from the date of final development permit approval 2 if the directors determination as to any of these conditions is negative then a new complete site plan review and impact evaluation process must be completed prior to issuance of any building permits subject to the following a if that determination is based upon a material or substantial change in conditions then the new development review process shall consider only those changed conditions b if that determination is based on a change in the site development proposal then the new development review process shall consider only those items in the proposal that are changed 3 the costs and expenditures incurred by the applicant in accompanying his application for development permit with a complete specific site development proposal and in meeting all site plan review and impact evaluation requirements shall not in any way create for the applicant any expectation of or reliance on development approval this is especially true with respect to rezoning or variance requests which must be evaluated on factors such as conformity with the comprehensive plan compatible land uses and many other factors in addition to impact evaluation 4 if an applicant has had his rezoning variance or plat application reviewed in absence of a complete specific site development proposal and approved on the basis of the presumption of the most intense development permitted under the applicable regulations then if the applicant submits a complete specific site development proposal within one year from the date of approval he shall be subject only to site plan review and not impact evaluation 5 if an applicant has had his rezoning variance or plat application reviewed in the absence of a complete specific site development proposal and approved on the basis of his submission of a specific proposed use then if the applicant submits a complete specific site development proposal reflecting that proposed use within one year from the date of approval he shall be subject only to site plan review and not impact evaluation if he submits a complete specific site development proposal for a different and in any aspect a more intense use the application shall be subject to a new complete site plan review and impact evaluation process app a art vii  2   1152014 review procedures a staff review 1 all

for specified public facilities and services the cms also includes a monitoring system for determination of the availability of adequate capacity of public facilities and services to meet the adopted level of service standards  adopted levels of service shall not be degraded a general rule all applications for development orders shall demonstrate that the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service in the city b exception notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a of this section the prescribed levels of service may be degraded during the actual construction of new

service shall be two years unless extended by the city commission  determination of available capacity a method for purposes of this article the available capacity of a facility shall be determined by 1 adding together a the total capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service  and b the total capacity of new facilities if any that will become available on or before the date of occupancy of the development the capacity of new facilities may be counted only if one or more of the following is shown 1 construction of the new facilities is under way at the time of issuance of the final development order 2 the new facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for the construction of the facilities or the provision of services at the time of issuance of the final development order 3 the new facilities are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement an enforceable development agreement may include but is not limited to development agreements pursuant to fs   et seq or an agreement or development order pursuant to fs ch 380 such facilities shall be consistent with the capital improvements element of the city comprehensive plan 2

facility created by the anticipated completion of other approved developments redevelopment or other development activity b action upon failure to show available capacity where available capacity cannot be shown the following methods may be used to maintain adopted levels of service 1 the project owner or developer may provide the necessary improvements to maintain level of service in such case the application shall include appropriate plans for improvements documentation that such improvements are designed to provide the capacity necessary to achieve or maintain the level of service and recordable instruments guaranteeing the construction consistent with calculations of capacity all improvements necessary to achieve or maintain adopted levels of service shall be in place prior to
