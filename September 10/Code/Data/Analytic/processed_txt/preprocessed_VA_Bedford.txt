applicability the power cost adjustment pca shall be applicable to and become part of each electric rate schedule in the tariff except schedule ol b methodology the pca is an adjustment to each electric customers monthly bill that is applied to the customers individual kwh consumption in order to recover changing power costs when there have been increases in such costs and to reduce said charge when there have been decreases in power costs several conditions affect the cost of power including but not limited to weather demand transmission costs and contract stipulations when there are increases in power costs the pca allows recovery of those costs if the cost of power decreases decreased costs are passed along to the customer as well a sixmonth fixed average pca formula set forth in this schedule is designed to provide customers with a stable rate structure which will be adjusted every six months in order to reflect changes in power costs the sixmonth fixed pca calculation is based on the following eight considerations 1 base the pca on fixed sixmonth period of historical bedfords billing data  2 automatically adjust twice per year in order to include heavy use months of june july and august in one sixmonth period and heavy use months of december january and february in another sixmonth data period  3 differentiate pca charges by voltage level of service 4 allow for adjustments for known changes such as the increase in transmission costs for this year  5 make a provision for an emergency adjustment for unforeseen cost events storms equipment failures replacement power  6 provide for a trueup adjustment when the pca revenue received in a sixmonth period does not match actual power cost for the period  7 provide council with a report which calculates the pca prior to the automatic adjustments so that the town council may decide not to implement all or part of any pca increase  8 include a notice in bills to customers when the pca changes c calculation of pca under formula the amount charged for each kwh of energy sold by the town as set forth in the applicable schedules to this tariff shall be increased or decreased in accordance with the following pca adjustment procedure step 1identification of actual historical power costs pc the power source includes a the total amp bill b snowden operating costs c holcomb rock purchases d diesel fuel purchases e other power purchases such as solar power step 2adjustments a deduct amp administrative costs found on amp bill b add or deduct known and measurable changes anticipated in transmission rates or other material cost factors during the next six months step 3deduct amp related charges on amp bill or other quantities applicable to certain customers billed under rate schedules not subject to the pca step 4identify actual sales from the power reports for the most recent six months step 5calculate the total sales for the most recent sixmonth period and the total adjusted costs from the most recent sixmonth period step 6calculate the sixmonth average power cost by dividing the total adjusted sixmonth costs by the total sixmonth sales step 7 a compare the actual revenue recovered under the pca for the last six months with the actual power costs during that sixmonth period  b calculate the difference in over or under recovery during the sixmonth period  c trueup the over or under recovery by dividing the amount of over or under recovery by the anticipated sales for the next six months this calculation is intended to recapture actual costs not recovered during the sixmonth period under the pca by spreading such recovery over the next six months or by making corresponding reductions in the pca over the next six months to spread out over recovery step 8make emergency adjustments for unanticipated replacement power or other unforeseen conditions that may have a substantial impact upon power costs storms equipment failures replacement power costs any emergency adjustments must be approved by town council step 9add the sixmonth average power cost from step 6 with the trueup value from step 7 and any emergency adjustment from step 8 note that all values are expressed in $kwh basis step 10subtract the amount of power cost included in the base rates from the adjusted power cost calculated in step 9 note loss adjustment is applied for customers taking service at primary voltages by multiplying the average pca calculated in step 10 by 98 d application of pca changes the electric department shall recalculate the pca at sixmonth intervals to become effective on november 1 and may 1 based upon actual data available from the most recent sixmonth period the town shall provide all electrical customers a notice of pca changes as part of monthly billings e review by council calculations of proposed automatic pca changes shall be reported to town council at its second meetings in april at which time council shall review the proposed pca for the next six months beginning on may 1 and at the second meeting in october for the next six months beginning november 1 the proposed pca for the next six months shall take effect immediately on november 1 or may 1 unless the council at the second meeting in october or april determines otherwise the town council retains at all times its authority to set electric rates including changes to

general principles outlined below 1 the operation and maintenance expenses are primarily related to the volume and strength of the wastewater these costs should be recovered from the current users of the system where all wastewater is the same strength ie domestic wastewater the costs shall be directly related to volume where the wastewater varies in strength ie strong wastes the difference in strength shall be considered when allocating costs 2 annual expenses for the collection system are primarily related to volume therefore that portion of the user charge for the collection system shall be based on volume or flow rate 3 annual expenses for the treatment facility are related to volume and wastewater strength with wastewater strength based on bod 5  suspended solids and in some cases nitrogen user charges and strong waste surcharges will incorporate these factors d the user charges will be based upon the methodology presented in a schedule which is not contained in this but will be found on file in the offices of the town clerk and the town manager the user charge will be reviewed annually in accordance with the procedures outlined in this section e all user charges surcharges and pretreatment program fees will be reviewed annually in conjunction with the establishment and approval of the town budget by the town council it shall be the duty of the town manager or his designated representative to notify the users of changes in the rate structure for such user charges surcharges and pretreatment program fees f the purpose of this annual review is to ensure that adequate revenues are generated to pay for the costs of operation and maintenance including replacement costs and that the rate structure continues to provide for the proportional distribution of recoverable costs among the users 3 billing a the industrial waste surcharge and pretreatment program fees provided for in this article shall be included as separate items and paid monthly in accordance with other water and sewer fees and charges surcharges and pretreatment program fees shall be paid at the same time as the water and sewer charges of the person become due and payment for

service when due or failure to pay the established sewer surcharge for industrial waste or pretreatment program fees when due or repeated discharge of prohibited waste to the sanitary sewer shall be sufficient cause to disconnect any and all services to the water andor sanitary sewer mains of the town and the same penalties and charges now or hereafter provided for by the ordinances of the town for failure to pay the bill for water and sewer service when due shall be applicable in like manner in cases of failure to pay the established surcharge for industrial waste discharged to the sanitary sewer mains or pretreatment program fees as established herein c each user shall pay for the services provided by the town based on his use of the treatment works as determined by water meter readings or other appropriate methods acceptable to and approved by the town d for residential industrial institutional and commercial users monthly user charges will be based on actual water usage if a residential commercial institutional or industrial user has a consumptive use of water or in some other manner uses water which is not discharged into the wastewater collection system the user charge for that contributor may be based on readings of wastewater meter installed and maintained at the users expense e a late payment penalty of 1 percent of the user charge bill will be added to each delinquent bill for each 30 days or portion thereof of delinquency f when any bill including interest and penalty remains unpaid for one year after the date due such bill shall be recorded in the land

while the granting of variances generally is limited to a lot size less than onehalf acre deviations from that limitation may occur however as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing a variance increases variances may be issued by the board of zoning appeals for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level in conformance with the provisions of this section variances may be issued for new

documentation pertaining to any request for a variance to any engineer or other qualified person or agency for technical assistance in evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights and velocities and the adequacy of the plans for flood protection and other related matters variances shall be issued only after the board of zoning appeals has determined that the granting of such will not result in a unacceptable or prohibited increases in flood heights b additional threats to public safety c extraordinary public expense  and will not d create nuisances e cause fraud or
