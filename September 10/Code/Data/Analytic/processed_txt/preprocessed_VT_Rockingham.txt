amended section generally  effective  amended   effective  3130 home occupations  home businesses the town of rockingham recognizes the need of some residents to use their place of residence for limited nonresidential activities however the town believes that this must be balanced with the need to protect the character of its residential areas and to protect these neighborhoods from the nuisances business activities in residential areas may lead to changing the dominant residential character to a partially commercial one this can result from altering traffic patterns police and fire service parking requirements noise and appearance including signs and lighting many home occupations which were once traditional or customary have evolved into commercial enterprises which are no longer compatible with residential neighborhoods while new occupations have developed which do not have any impact on a residential area homebased businesses that employ nonresidents may expand to the point that the business is no longer secondary to the residential use further home activities in more rural areas are less likely to disturb neighbors than those occurring in close proximity to an abutter this needs to be taken into account therefore two categories of nonresidential use are set forth in order to adequately provide for the needs and protection of residents  home occupation approval allows for resident occupants to conduct limited nonresidential activity if meeting the criteria set forth in the general standards  and category 1  home occupations  upon issuance of a zoning permit by the administrative officer home business approval is less restrictive and allows for limited outside employees for those uses meeting the criteria set forth in the general standards  and category 2  home businesses  a home business must be approved as a conditional use by the development review board it is the intent of this section to a ensure the compatibility of home occupations and businesses with other uses permitted in the residential districts  b maintain and preserve the character of residential neighborhoods 3131 general standards the general standards set forth below are applicable to both home occupations and home business a no home occupation or home business shall be permitted without the issuance of a zoning permit b the home occupation or home business shall be operated by a person for whom the property is a primary residence the permit is valid only while that persons resides thereon c the permit is not transferable from address to address

of five 5 years and shall be renewed by the applicant it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to renew a permit e a home occupation or home business permit once granted may be renewed without additional hearings subject to the provisions of this subsection by completing the renewal form provided by the zoning office and paying the renewal fee f notice of a request for renewal without

via telephone or mail 13 an activity which grows to exceed the definition and criteria of a home occupation will be required to relocate to a district in which the activity is a permitted or conditional use or apply and obtain a home business permit if applicable for example the need for additional employees is usually an indication that the home occupation has grown to such an extent that it should no longer be considered incidental to the residential use but rather has become a home business or a fullfledged commercial business c the following activities are some examples of activities which may meet home occupation requirements 1 dressmaking sewing tailoring millinery contract sewing 2 laundry ironing service 3 music or dance teaching provided that the instruction shall

for gainful employment involving the creation provision or sales of services andor goods wherein a limited number of persons in addition to the resident occupants may be employed because other than resident occupants may be employed in a home business this activity has a greater chance of disturbing a neighborhood waste disposal and use of hazardous materials are also of concern therefore more scrutiny is needed for these applications this classification also recognizes that in less populated areas home businesses are less likely to disturb the residential peace of adjacent properties thus

the proposed structure cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved tower or structure due to one of the following reasons b the propose antennas and equipment would exceed the structural or spatial capacity of the existing or approved tower or facility as documented by a qualified engineer licensed to practice in the state of vermont additionally the existing or approved tower cannot be reinforced modified or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost to provide coverage and capacity comparable to that of the proposed facility c the proposed antennas and equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usefulness of other existing or permitted equipment at the existing or approved tower or facility as documented by a qualified engineer

portions of the industrial and the central business expansion districts 47131 design subdistricts the following subdistricts have been established recognizing that each district will have different but related guidelines and criteria given the uses and existing buildings in the particular subdistrict the term subdistrict refers to that portion of the district that falls within the downtown district and therefore is subject to design review central business subdistrict zoning district cb 7 the central business subdistrict can be divided into three distinct neighborhoods the downtown commercial core a transitional area leading into the downtown core and a small residential area located on canal street the downtown core has the greatest concentration of traditional commercial storefronts aligned along the sidewalk of rockingham street canal street and bridge street in the area known as the square the  majority of the buildings were built during the late 19th century and display characteristics of the italianate second empire romanesque and queen ann style interspersed among those buildings are scattered examples of earlier vernacular federal and greek revival styles red brick is the predominant building material in the downtown core however there are buildings sheathed in wood tin and other materials most structures are two to three stories in height although an occasional onestory building can be found some of the upper stories are used for residential purposes there are little to no side setbacks roof forms in the downtown core appear predominantly flat reflecting horizontal cornices and moldings of traditional commercial structures unifying faade components include storefront display windows defined entrances and sign bands additionally the majority of upper story windows are vertically proportioned with wood frame and sash most upper story windows are spaced in a uniform pattern street trees line the sidewalks and onstreet parking is provided flush mounted signs and projecting signs represent the majority of signs found in the downtown core in the transition area the downtown core changes to wood frame commercial blocks along the incoming streets of rockingham canal and westminster streets there is a mix of wood vinyl and concrete block building materials used parking lots can be found on westminster street and on the west side of the rockingham street just north of the square on canal street a row of 19th century detached brick and wooden 1  story houses with gable ends facing the street align along the street small landscaped yards and residential parking areas are located on the sides of the residences industrial subdistrict zoning district ind 14 the industrial subdistrict encompasses the entire island as well as a portion of land of off of mill street red brick is the predominant building material however renovations and expansions to buildings have introduced other materials to the district the roofs are generally flat historically the island was a hub of manufacturing while industrial uses are still prevalent commercial activities including tourism have expanded into the district the parcels are large and there is open space due to demolition of buildings and municipal parking lots the island serves as an intermodal transportation center with rail transportation having a strong presence the east end of bridge street serves as a gateway to the central business subdistrict central business expansion subdistrict zoning district cbe14 and part of zoning district r7 the central business expansion subdistrict extends in a linear fashion to the north and south of the central business subdistrict these are areas that serve as transition zones between the central business subdistrict and residential areas they are areas with a mix of new commercial structures and large residential structures that have been or have the potential to be converted to commercial and institutional uses the
