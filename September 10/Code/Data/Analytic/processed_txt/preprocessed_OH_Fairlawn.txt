the numbering system used in these codified ordinances is similar to that used in the ohio revised is consistent with general practice each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 23802 indicates that the code number is 2 the chapter number is 238 or the 38th chapter within code 2 and the section number is 02 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the decimal the section number appears to the right of the decimal as another example 40801 indicates that the code number is 4 the chapter number is 408 or the 8th chapter within code 4 and the section number is 01 with this numbering system the codified ordinances may be expanded almost endlessly codes titles and chapters are initially evennumbered thus reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as in the revised are the traffic and general offenses codes where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter in each are included as part of the substantive sections newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 66006 and precede 66007 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code subsections without histories or with the words adopting  at the end thereof are or contain new matter ordained by the adopting enacts these codified ordinances the comparative is included to show the disposition of every ordinance and resolution included in these codified ordinances it indicates whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more sections cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter comparative editors note source material for the 1975 codified ordinances of
