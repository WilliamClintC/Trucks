findings and intent the eden prairie city council does hereby find that 1 numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing secondhand smoke also known as environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers including heart disease stroke respiratory disease and lung cancer the us surgeon general has determined that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of 65000 americans annually 2 the public health services national toxicology program has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen us dhhs 200 citing cal epa 1997 949 3 secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired respiratory function including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma respiratory infections sudden infant death syndrome developmental abnormalities and cancer 4 the americans with disabilities act which requires that disabled persons have access to public places and workplaces deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability 5 the us surgeon general has determined that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce but does not eliminate the exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke the environmental protection agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation air cleaners which are only capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke 6 a significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace employees who work in smokefilled businesses suffer a 2550% higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function 7 smokefilled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease lower productivity higher cleaning and maintenance costs increased health insurance

manager under this regulation of pet stores source effective date 5102018 subd 1 policy a the city council finds that a significant number of puppies and kittens sold at pet stores come from largescale commercial breeding facilities where the health and welfare of the animals are not adequately provided for  and b the city council finds that the documented abuses endemic to mass breeding facilities include overbreeding  inbreeding  minimal to noexistent veterinary care  lack of adequate and nutritious food water and shelter  lack of socialization  lack of adequate space  lack of adequate exercise  no or limited screening of genetic diseases  inadequate transportation and shipping protocols of puppies and kittens  and indiscriminate disposal of breeding dogs and cats who have reached the end of their profitable breeding cycle  and c the city council finds that inhumane conditions in mass breeding facilities lead to health and behavioral issues in the animals bred in those facilities which many consumers are unaware of when purchasing animals from pet stores due to both a lack of education on the issue and misleading tactics of pet stores in some cases these health and behavioral issues which may not present themselves until sometime after the purchase of the animals can impose exorbitant financial and emotional costs on consumers  and d the city council finds that current federal and state regulations do not properly address the sale of dogs and cats in pet stores while the city of eden prairie does not possess adequate resources to safeguard the health and wellbeing of dogs and cats at the point of sale  and e the city council finds that due in large part to pet overpopulation numerous dogs and cats are euthanized restricting the retail sale of puppies and kittens is likely to increase demand from animal shelters and rescue organizations  and f the city council finds that across the country thousands of independent pet stores as well as large chains operate profitably with a business model focused on the sale of pet services and supplies and not the sale of commercially bred dogs or cats many of these stores collaborate with local animal shelters and rescue organizations to offer space and support for showcasing adoptable homeless pets on their premises  and g the city council finds that it is in the best interest of the city of eden prairie to adopt reasonable regulations to help prevent inhumane breeding conditions promote community awareness of animal welfare and foster a more humane environment in the city h the city council finds that this will not adversely impact consumers ability to obtain a dog or cat of their choice directly from an animal shelter or breedspecific rescue organization or from a breeder where the consumer can see directly the conditions in which the dogs or cats are bred or can confer directly with the breeder concerning those conditions  and i the city council finds that it is in the best interest of the city of eden prairie to adopt reasonable regulations to help prevent inhumane breeding conditions promote community awareness of animal welfare and foster a more human environment in the city j

disfigurement of the places where they are carried on and thus may affect existing land uses in nearby areas discourage further permanent development of the surrounding properties impair adequate planning or municipal development and diminish public health safety and general welfare it is therefore desirable to regulate land alterations in the city b tree removal damage and destruction tends to endanger the natural character of the land from which the trees have been removed and surrounding lands and to diminish and impair the public health safety and general welfare the council desires to protect the integrity of the natural environment and finds that trees do so by providing for better air quality scenic beauty protection against wind and water erosion and natural insulation for energy preservation further the council finds that trees protect privacy and provide enhancement of property values it is therefore the further purpose of this provide regulations relating to the cutting removal or killing of trees with the consequent damage and destruction of the wooded and forested areas of the city to promote the orderly development of such areas and thereby minimize public and private losses  to insure maintenance of the natural vegetation and topography  to encourage protection and preservation of the natural environment and beauty of the city  to encourage a resourceful and prudent approach to urban development of wooded areas which provides for minimal tree loss and mitigation of tree removal resulting from development  to provide an objective method to evaluate a developments impact on trees and wooded areas and identify whether and how the impact may be reduced  to provide incentive for creative land use and good site design which preserves trees while allowing development in wooded areas with mitigation of tree removal and destruction  and to provide for enforcement and administration thereby promoting and protecting the public health safety

repealed source effective date 9152005 subd 7 dynamic displays a findings studies show that there is a correlation between dynamic displays on signs and the distraction of highway drivers distraction can lead to traffic accidents drivers can be distracted not only by a changing message but also by knowing that the sign has a changing message drivers may watch a sign waiting for the next change to occur additionally drivers are more distracted by special effects used to change the message such as fadeins and fadeouts time and temperature signs appear to be an exception to these concerns because the messages are short easily absorbed and become inaccurate without frequent changes despite these public safety concerns there is merit to allowing new technologies to easily update messages except as prohibited by state or federal law sign owners should have the opportunity to use these technologies with certain restrictions the restrictions are intended to minimize potential driver distraction and to minimize proliferation in residential districts where signs can adversely impact residential character the city finds that dynamic displays should be allowed on signs but with significant controls to minimize their proliferation and their potential threats to public safety b permitted sign type and locations dynamic displays are permitted solely as freestanding signs and only in the

no dynamic display may be of such intensity or brilliance that it interferes with the effectiveness of an official traffic sign device or signal 4 the owner or controller of the dynamic display must
