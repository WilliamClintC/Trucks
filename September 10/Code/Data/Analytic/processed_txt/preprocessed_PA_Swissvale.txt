allowed 4200 805 2625 appendix a low impact development practices alternative approach for managing stormwater runoff natural hydrologic conditions may be altered by poorly planned development practices such as introducing unneeded impervious surfaces destroying existing drainage swales constructing unnecessary storm sewers and changing local topography a traditional drainage approach of development has been to remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a detention basin this approach leads ultimately to the degradation of water quality as well as expenditure of additional resources for detaining and managing concentrated runoff at some downstream location the recommended alternative is to promote practices that will minimize postdevelopment runoff rates and volumes which in turn will minimize needs for artificial conveyance and storage facilities to simulate predevelopment hydrologic conditions forced infiltration is often necessary to offset the loss of infiltration by creation of impervious surfaces the ability of the ground to infiltrate depends upon the soil types and its conditions preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful alternative site design considerations site design practices include preserving natural drainage features minimizing impervious surface area reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces and protecting natural depression storage a welldesigned site will contain a mix of all those features the following describes various techniques to achieve the alternative approach preserving natural drainage features protecting natural drainage features particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels is desirable because of their ability to infiltrate and attenuate flows and to filter pollutants however this objective is often not accomplished in land development in fact commonly held drainage philosophy encourages just the opposite pattern  streets and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in the natural headwater valleys and swales thereby replacing natural drainage functions with a completely impervious system as a result runoff and pollutants generated from impervious surfaces flow directly into storm sewers with no opportunity for attenuation infiltration or filtration developments designed to fit site topography also minimizes the amount of grading on site protecting natural depression storage areas depressional storage areas have no surface outlet or drain very slowly following a storm event they can be commonly seen as ponded areas in farm fields during the wet season or after large runoff events traditional development practices eliminate these depressions by filling or draining thereby obliterating their ability to reduce surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants the volume and releaserate characteristics of depressions should be protected in the design of the development site the depressions can be protected by simply avoiding the depression or by incorporating its storage as additional capacity in required detention facilities avoiding introduction of impervious areas careful site planning should consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible building 2626 footprints sidewalks driveways and other features producing impervious surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces impervious surfaces are significantly less of a problem if they are not directly connected to an impervious conveyance system such as storm sewer two basic ways to reduce hydraulic connectivity are routing of roof runoff over lawns and reducing the use of storm sewers site grading should promote increasing travel time of stormwater runoff and should help reduce concentration of runoff to a single point in the development routing roof runoff over lawns roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns in most site designs the practice discourages direct connections of downspouts to storm sewers or parking lots the practice also discourages sloping driveways and parking lots to the street by routing roof drains and crowning the driveway to run off to the lawn the lawn is essentially used as a filter strip reducing the use of storm sewers by reducing use of storm sewers for draining streets parking lots and back yards the potential for accelerating runoff from the development can be greatly reduced the practice requires greater use of swales and may not be practical for some development sites especially if there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a reasonable time the practice requires educating local citizens and public works officials who expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event reducing street widths street widths can be reduced by either eliminating onstreet parking or by reducing roadway widths municipal planners and traffic designers should encourage narrower neighborhood streets which ultimately could lower maintenance limiting sidewalks to one side of the street a sidewalk on one side of the street may suffice in lowtraffic neighborhoods the lost sidewalk could be replaced with bicyclerecreational trails that follow backoflot lines where appropriate backyard trails should be constructed using pervious materials using permeable paving materials these materials include permeable interlocking concrete paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete such materials should be considered as alternatives to conventional pavement surfaces especially for low use surfaces such as driveways overflow parking lots and emergency access roads reducing building setbacks reducing building setbacks reduces driveway and entry walks and is most readily accomplished along lowtraffic streets where traffic noise is not a problem constructing cluster developments cluster developments can also reduce the amount of impervious area for a given number of lots the biggest savings is in street length which also will reduce costs of the development cluster development clusters the construction activity onto lesssensitive areas without substantially affecting the gross density of development in summary a careful consideration of the existing topography and implementation of a combination of the above mentioned techniques may avoid construction of costly stormwater control measures other benefits include reduced potential of downstream flooding water quality degradation of receiving streamswater bodies and enhancement of aesthetics and reduction of development costs beneficial results 2627 include more stable baseflows in receiving streams improved groundwater recharge reduced flood flows reduced pollutant loads and reduced costs for conveyance and storage 2628

and further that allegheny countys baseyear system as applied was unconstitutionally nonuniform  and whereas although the decision indicated that allowing thehaseyeat assessment system to stand indefinitely was a problem that needed to be addressed on a statewide basis the supreme court also acknowledged that there had been no actionby the general assembly and ordered the court to oversee a reassessment of property in allegheny county  and whereas the supreme court decision and the lack of actionhy the general assembly has resulted in allegheny county being unfairly singledout and soete6 to a cokyt_ ordered reassessment that is bringing uncertainty and fear to residents businesses govatments and school districts throughout the county  and whereas the specific targeting of allegheny

provides for uniformity among all counties in the commonwealth as you know allegheny county is in the midst of a courtordered reassessment in which only information for the city of pittsburgh and mt oliver borough has been released to date there have been numerous stories about the large numbers substantial increases and shocking values from just those properties this is the first update of values in a decade and the increases are simply terrifying to some property owners while allegheny county residents are dealing with the uncertainty and fear of fighting to ensure that a fair value is placed on their properties our neighboring counties have been able to keep their old numbers for decades there is no difference between the baseyear system that allegheny county has used and the baseyear system used by surrounding counties but the supreme court believes otherwise our county can no longer be discriminated against and targeted for these reassessments our county and its municipalities will again see residents and businesses migrate to our neighboring counties the hard work we have done to stabilize property assessments and promote economic growth during the last decade has shown results prior to 200 allegheny county lagged the nation in property value appreciation but we have seen those values stabilized during the last five years while national property
