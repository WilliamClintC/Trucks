titles in this separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time

value of the improvement fair market value shall be determined by the director based on credible evidence of the following 1 for dedicated lands value shall be based upon a written appraisal of fair market value by a qualified professional appraiser based upon comparable sales of similar property between unrelated parties in an armslength transaction  2 for a qualified public improvement value shall be approved by director based upon a detailed cost estimate for anticipated cost of construction including supporting cost documentation any such cost estimates shall be based on industry

evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this title and 1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4 the importance of

zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece or property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare g variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dryfloodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all

the metro esee analysis it is intended to resolve conflicts between development and conservation of habitat stream corridors wetlands and floodplains identified in the citys maps the nrod contributes to the following functional values a protect and restore streams and riparian areas for their ecologic functions and as an open space amenity for the community b protect floodplains and wetlands and restore them for improved hydrology flood protection aquifer recharge and habitat functions c protect upland habitats and enhance connections between upland and riparian habitat d maintain and enhance water quality and control erosion and sedimentation revegetation of disturbed sites and by placing limits on construction impervious surfaces and pollutant discharges e conserve scenic recreational and educational values of significant natural resources the nrod ecological functions listed above are planned for integration with existing neighborhoods and new residential and commercial

option the mitigation requirement is calculated based on the size of the disturbance area within the nrod native trees and shrubs are required to be planted at a rate of five trees and twentyfive shrubs per every five hundred square feet of disturbance area calculated by dividing the number of square feet of disturbance area by five hundred and then multiplying that result times five trees and twentyfive shrubs and rounding all fractions to the nearest whole number of trees and shrubs  for example if there will be three hundred thirty square feet of disturbance area then three hundred thirty divided by five hundred equals 66 and 66 times five equals 33 so three trees must be planted and 66 times twentyfive equals 165 so seventeen shrubs must be planted bare ground must be planted or seeded with native grasses or herbs nonnative sterile wheat grass may also be planted or seeded in equal or lesser proportion to the native grasses or herbs b option 2  plant size plantings may

and intent it is the intent of this chapter to foster the growth of major institutions and other largescale development while identifying and mitigating the impacts of such growth on surrounding properties and public infrastructure the city recognizes the valuable services and employment opportunities that these developments bring to oregon city residents the master plan process is intended to facilitate an efficient and flexible review process for major developments and to provide them with the assurance they need over the long term so that they can plan for and execute their developments in a phased manner to facilitate this the master plan process is structured to allow an applicant to address the larger development issues such as adequacy of infrastructure and transportation capacity and reserve capacity of the infrastructure and transportation system before expenditure of final design costs exh 1 772010   what is included in a master plan a a master plan is a twostep process that includes a general development plan and a detailed development plan a general development plan incorporates the entire area where development is planned in the next five to twenty years including the identification of one or more development phases the general development plan may encompass land that is not currently under the applicants control but which eventually may be controlled by the applicant during the duration of the master plan the plan shall have no effect for lands not currently controlled by the applicant controlled shall be defined as leased or owned by the applicant a detailed development plan is the phase or phases of the general development plan that are proposed for development within twoyears b a master plan identifies the current and proposed use of the development as defined by the general development plan boundary if approved the general development plan may be used to allow existing legal nonconforming uses if conditions of approval from a previous land use decision have not been completed they must be modified general development plan or completed with new development c a master plan identifies future development impacts thresholds for mitigation and mitigation improvements and implementation schedules a threshold for mitigation is the point that determines when or where a mitigation improvement will be required examples of thresholds include vehicle trips square feet of impervious surface area water usage measured in gallons per minute construction of a building within a general development plan and construction of a building within a certain distance of a residential lot mitigation improvements are improvements that will be made or constructed by an institution when a threshold for mitigation is reached examples include road dedication intersection improvement road widening construction of a stormwater or water quality facility installation of vegetative buffering and wetland restoration or

than the proposed site or on the proposed site in a manner which does not require an adjustment under this subsection 2 the planning commission may grant an adjustment to a standard when the proposed adjustment would utilize existing site characteristics to minimize demonstrated or potential impacts on the use of surrounding properties for the purposes of this subsection site characteristics shall include but need not be limited to the suitability of the proposed use considering size shape location topography existence of improvements and natural features applicants for an adjustment under this
