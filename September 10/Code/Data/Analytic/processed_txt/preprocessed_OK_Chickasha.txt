off and maneuvering of aircraft thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the airport and the public investment herein accordingly it is hereby declared that 1 the creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the community served by the airport  2 it is therefore necessary in the interest of the public health public safety and general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport hazards be prevented  and 3 the prevention of these airport hazards or obstructions should be accomplished to the extent legally possible by the exercise of the

which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage b statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area c methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes

require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains

development herein referred to as pud is a special zoning district category that provides an alternate approach to conventional land use controls the pud may be used for particular tracts or parcels of land that are under common ownership and are to be developed as one unit according to a master development plan the pud is subject to special review procedures once approved by the city council it becomes a special zoning classification for the property it represents b intent and purpose 1 it is the intent of this section to encourage unified design of residential commercial industrial or institutional areas and facilities or combinations thereof and to provide for integrated development having harmony of design and variety of function it is also the intent of this section to encourage the development of planned commercial and industrial sites to eliminate the adverse impacts of traditional strip zoning 2 the purpose of the pud provision is to a encourage innovative land development while maintaining appropriate limitations on the character and intensity of use ensuring compatibility with adjoining and proximate properties and following the guidelines of the comprehensive plan  b permit flexibility within the development to maximize the unique physical features of the particular site  c encourage efficient use of land facilitate economic arrangement of buildings and circulation systems and encourage diversified living environments and land uses  d achieve a continuity of function and design within the development  e encourage innovative development of smaller parcels and land that have been passed over  and f provide a vehicle for negotiating modifications in standard development requirements in order to both encourage innovative development and protect the health safety and welfare of the community c planned unit development authorized 1 a pud may be authorized by an amendment to the official zoning districts map after public hearing by the planning commission and city council a pud shall be considered a special zoning district and it may be authorized for any use or a combination of uses permitted in this chapter 2 a pud must comply with the following requirements a a pud zoning district shall have a minimum area of not less than one acre or the minimum area requirement of the zoning district which the pud is based upon whichever is greater b a pud master plan is required as the basis for review and approval of a pud application the pud master plan shall be adopted as a part of the ordinance of rezoning and shall be in conformance with the requirements of these regulations and the following 1 the pud master plan shall consist of two elements the design statement and the master development plan map  2 the pud master plan shall establish residential densities as well as amounts type and general location of all land uses  and 3 the pud master plan shall serve as the basis for review and approval of all subdivision plats and building permits within the pud d effect of planned unit development approval 1 approval of a zoning change to pud adopts the master plan prepared by the applicant and reviewed as part of the application the master plan establishes new and specific requirements for amount and type of land use residential densities development regulations and location of specific elements of the development such as open space landscaping and screening 2 the pud classification replaces any previous zoning district classification on a parcel 3 where there is no provision in the pud master plan for special development regulations the requirements of the most restrictive conventional zoning district in which a proposed use or a structure is permitted shall be applied to the development e criteria for planned unit development review and approval because the pud provides the opportunity for higher densities greater design flexibility mixed land uses and improved marketability the applicant should be prepared to provide amenities and services that might not be required or possible in a conventional development review and approval of a pud is therefore a process of negotiation between the city government and the applicant to achieve the intents and purposes of these regulations and the comprehensive plan the following factors should be specifically included as review criteria for the evaluation of a pud application other factors not listed herein may also be considered in the review process in order to respond to specific design and land use proposals the following design standards shall be specifically included as review criteria for the evaluation of a pud application 1 intent the proposed pud shall be designed to provide for the unified development of the area in accordance with the spirit and purpose of the comprehensive plan and the land uses and zoning districts adjacent to it 2 design design of the pud may provide for modification of

development is proposed to abut a lower intensity area 12 mixed land use development where a pud proposes a mix of uses which would generally be incompatible with a conventional development the pud master plan should specifically establish appropriate guidelines to ensure a harmonious development 13 common access in commercial or industrial developments the pud master plan should establish specific standards and locations for common access driveways both within the development and abutting arterial streets streets and alleys for puds shall be designed and constructed in accordance with city standards and specifications for rightofway width and paving cross sections f pud application 1 review procedure the developer or builder of a pud shall follow a fivestep application and review
