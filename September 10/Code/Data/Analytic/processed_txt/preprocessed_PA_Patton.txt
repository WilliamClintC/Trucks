consideration with regard to stormwater management  14714 performance standards a sensitive areas are defined as those areas that if developed have the potential to cause contamination of groundwater reservoirs of a water authority penn state university or regulated water association wellfield these areas consist of the delineated oneyear zone of contribution and direct upslope areas tributary to the wells see appendix b exhibits 1 and 2133 municipalities may update the sensitive area boundaries based on new research or studies as required b water quality sensitive wqs development is defined as a land development project that has a high potential to cause catastrophic loss to local water quality and could potentially threaten groundwater reservoirs the following is a provisional list of water quality sensitive developments 1 vehicle fuel stations 2 industrial manufacturing sites 3 salvage yards 4 recycling centers 5 hazardous material storage areas 6 interstate highways the municipal engineer will make the determination relative to what constitutes these classifications on a casebycase basis the pennsylvania dep wellhead protection contaminant source list shall be used as a guide in these determinations industrial manufacturing site and hazardous material storage areas must provide npdes sic codes a general postdevelopment rates of runoff from any regulated activity shall not exceed the peak release rates of runoff prior to development for the design storms specified b sensitive area district sad boundaries the location of sensitive areas or sensitive area districts within the watershed are illustrated on a map which is available for inspection at the municipal office a reduced scale copy of this map is included as exhibit 1 in appendix b of this chapter134 the exact location of the boundaries of sensitive areas are 133 editors note said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter  14713 reserved  14714  set by drainage areas tributary to each of the points of interest as illustrated in appendix b135 the exact location of these boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be determined using mapping at a scale which accurately defines the limits of the sensitive area if the project site is within the sensitive area in whole or in part twofoot contour interval mapping shall be provided to define the limits of the sensitive area if the project site is not immediately adjacent to but within 500 linear feet of a defined sensitive area a fivefoot contour interval map defining the limits of the sensitive area shall be included in the stormwater management plan to document the sites location relative to the sensitive area c sites located in more than one district for a proposed development site which is traversed by a sad boundary the design criteria for sensitive areas must be applied if postdevelopment runoff is directed towards the sensitive area d offsite areas offsite areas that drain from sensitive areas proposed development site that is located entirely in a nonsensitive area are not required to use or apply the sensitive area criteria e site areas where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity differs significantly from the total site area only the proposed impact area f downstream hydraulic capacity analysis any downstream or offsite hydraulic capacity analysis conducted in accordance with these standards shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow rates 1 natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the postdevelopment runoff associated with a twoyear return period event within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion acceptable velocities shall be based upon criteria included in the dep erosion and sediment pollution control program manual 2 natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the postdevelopment twentyfiveyear return period runoff without creating any hazard to persons or property 3 culverts bridges storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in accordance with dep regulations if applicable and at a minimum pass the posdevelopment twentyfiveyear return period runoff 4 it must be demonstrated that the downstream conveyance channel other stormwater facilities roadways or overland areas must be 134 editors note said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter 135 editors note said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter  14714 patton code  14714   14715 calculation methodologies design criteria and calculation methodologies have been classified by functional group for presentation as follows a peak runoff rate discharge requirements  b stormwater pond capture volumes  c recharge volumes  d storm drain design including conveyance channel protection and stability  and e water quality standards these criteria and calculation methodologies have been developed to simplify stormwater management designs unify methods remove model parameter subjectivity remove improperly used methods and to ensure stormwater management decisions are based more realistically on hydrologic processes in addition common sense should always be used as a controlling criteria prior to stormwater management and water quality design applicants should consult with the municipal engineer to verify stormwater quality criteria and present proposed features and concepts for the treatment of stormwater runoff following this meeting the municipal engineer shall define any needed support studies or documentation these standards provide consistent and processoriented design procedures for application by land development professionals it is recognized that in an attempt to generalize the computational procedures assumptions have been made which on some occasions may be violated if such a violation is identified alternate standards and procedures may be applied both the violation and the alternate procedures to be applied must be documented by a hydrologist or hydrogeologist any request for use of exemptions alternate standards or procedures under this chapter must be agreed to in wiring by the municipal engineer prior to formal submission of plans for consideration by the municipality a flow chart documenting the stormwater management design process is provided as exhibit 4 in appendix b136 of this chapter capable of safely conveying the onehundredyear design storm without causing damage to buildings or other infrastructure 5 where the downstream conveyance channel or other facility is located within a floodway it must be demonstrated that the limits of said flood hazard area are not increased by the proposed activity 6 stormwater management ponds that fall under the dep criteria of a dam must meet the criteria within a peak runoff rate control 1 exemptions a any site where the increase in postdevelopment peak runoff rates is determined to be negligible by the municipal engineer is exempt from the requirement to provide stormwater detention 136 editors note said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter  14714 reserved  14715   in support of this exemption it must be shown that the downstream conveyance systems have adequate capacity to convey the additional discharge without adversely affecting downstream properties this does not exempt the requirement for implementation of designs for water quality stormwater conveyance andor recharge as required a stormwater management plan and report documenting these design elements is also required the municipal engineer shall use a fivepercent increase as a general benchmark for defining negligible the final definition of negligible shall be at the municipal engineers discretion  prior to using this exemption and prior to any land development plan submission the design engineer must provide written documentation and computations as to why no peak runoff control should be required the municipal engineer has the right to reject any plan which uses this assumption without prior approval of the municipal engineer the intent of this exemption is to eliminate the need for multiple or piggyback detention facilities as a result of minor changes in imperviousness or land use upstream of existing stormwater control facilities b small sites less than one acre located directly adjacent to the main stem of creeks or within the floodplain are not required to provide stormwater detention unless directed to do so by the municipal engineer as a result of a documented drainage problem all other stormwater management standards must be implemented including water quality adequate stormwater conveyance andor recharge as required 2 stormwater management analysis must be performed using the following models the size criteria are based on drainage area size including site are and all offsite area draining across the development up to 100 acres in size nrcss tr55 or tr20 over 100 acres in size nrcss tr20 or hec1 hechms a the modified rational method using the gert aron curves may be used for any site less than or equal to two acres in size without prior authorization from the municipal engineer the modified rational method may also be used for sites between two and five acres in size where the municipal engineer has approved the methods use in this case the design engineer must make a written request to the municipal engineer explaining why the use of the modified rational method is more appropriate than the nrcss methods for the site in question  14715 patton code  14715  the design engineer should keep in mind that the modified rational methodology was not calibrated to account for the karst nature of the spring creek drainage basin and therefore its use should be limited to the special cases identified above in addition since the minimum discharge criteria are based on a calibration of the nrcs runoff mode their use is not appropriate if the modified rational method is used for runoff computations b the municipal engineer has the right to reject any swm design that uses hydrograph combinations with the modified rational method where the designer has not validated that the effects of the timing differences are negligible in addition the municipal engineer has the right to reject any swm design that improperly uses the method for determining runoff volumes or does not properly apply the method c more intensive physically based models may be used at the discretion of the municipal engineer but only for sites greater than 100 acres in size d commercial software packages that use the basic computational methods of tr55 or tr20 are permitted e the nrcs models and methods recommended above are based on data collected from actual watersheds in contrast to this stormwater management analysis for land development activities is often conducted using property lines to define drainage boundaries drainage areas based on property boundaries are not true watersheds and are referred to here as hypothetical drainage areas it is known that these hypothetical drainage areas do not respond like natural watersheds peak runoff rates from hypothetical drainage areas are much smaller than comparable runoff rates from natural watersheds of the same size therefore wherever possible pre and postdevelopment stormwater analysis should be conducted for watersheds that are as nearly natural as possible also conducting stormwater analysis for a lotbylot comparison as such as within residential developments is not permitted partitioning drainage areas into different subwatersheds for the postdevelopment scenarios is acceptable f it is noted that natural watershed boundaries should not be used where the relative size of the watershed compared to the site size would inappropriately distort the preto postdevelopment runoff comparison in these cases a hypothetical drainage area defined by the property boundary should be used because it will allow for a better estimate of runoff changes directly downstream of the site in addition the designer should recognize that within the spring creek  14715 reserved  14715  watershed typical hypothetical drainage areas in their predevelopment or natural condition do not produce surface runoff during minor to moderate rainfall events available hydrologic models do not accurately reflect this condition this often results in postdevelopment nuisance flooding since the models overestimate the predevelopment runoff magnitude 3 natural drainage divides may not be altered without the prior consent of the municipal engineer 4 pre and postdevelopment stormwater management analysis shall be conducted using the following design storms oneyear  twoyear  tenyear  onehundredyear 5 the twentyfourhour precipitation depths as obtained from noaa atlas 14 shall be used for stormwater management analysis 6 the nrcss type ii precipitation distribution is required for all stormwater management analyses 7 the nrcs dimensionless unit hydrograph k factor shall be 484 for both pre and postdevelopment stormwater analyses 8 all undeveloped areas are to be modeled as meadow or woods in good hydrologic condition existing impervious areas may be modeled as being impervious for predevelopment conditions the municipality may require a percentage of the existing impervious up to a 20% maximum be modeled as meadow in areas where there are known existing stormwater concerns downstream of the project area or where the site being developed has either deficient or nonexisting stormwater management facilities developers of sites with existing impervious are highly encouraged to set up a meeting with the municipality prior to design so that any additional requirements are identified prior to plan submission 9 the nrcss curve number cn shall be used as the rainfall to runoff transformation parameter for all stormwater management analyses 10 curve numbers should be rounded to tenths for use in prepackaged hydrologic models it should be recognized that the cn is only a design tool with a large degree of statistical variability for large sites cns should be rounded to the nearest whole number 11 the nrcss method to determine unconnected impervious area adjustments for cn can be used for distinctly defined impervious land areas that flow onto pervious areas in a dispersed manner the method may only be used to calculate runoff from site impervious areas that actually flow across pervious areas the method cannot be applied to the entire site using average weighted cn values  14715 patton code  14715  12 soils underlain by carbonate geology limestone or dolomite shall have a hydrologic soil group hsg b used for both pre and postdevelopment conditions regardless of the nrcs or soil surveys description except for the following two conditions a compacted structural fill areas shall use a minimum of hsg c for post development conditions regardless of the nrcs or soil surveys description for most developments compacted structural fill areas are under impervious surfaces but may include islands within parking areas fringe land etc a hsg c shall also be applied to large projects that clear and compact building pad areas for later phases of development under an initial phase the municipal engineer shall make the final determination as to what areas of a land development site constitute compacted structural fill the intent is to account for large compacted areas and not minor grading within lawn areas b soils identified as on floodplains or on terraces above floodplains in the centre county soil survey will use the hsg as designated in the soil survey refer to appendix a table a8 for a list of the soils137 13 soils not underlain by carbonate geology shall use the hsg as specified by the nrcs or soil surveys description except for the following two conditions a wooded areas on hsg c and d soils shall be treated as hsg b for predevelopment conditions disturbed postdevelopment wooded areas shall carry the nrcs or soil surveys defined hsg with a minimum hsg of b b highly compacted structural fill areas shall use a minimum of hsg c for postdevelopment conditions regardless of the nrcs or soil surveys description for most developments these areas are normally covered with impervious surfaces but may include islands within parking areas fringe lands etc a hsg of c shall also be used for large projects that clear and grade land for later phases of development the municipal engineer shall make the final determination as to what areas of a land development site constitute compacted structural fill the intent is to account for large compacted areas and not minor grading within lawn areas or small areas around buildings etc 14 areas draining to closed depressions must be modeled by removing the storage volume from the predevelopment condition the designer may assume that infiltration in the closed depression does not occur during a design runoff event areas draining to closed depressions may also be used to adjust peak runoff rates to 137 editors note said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter  14715 reserved  14715  stormwater management ponds for the postdevelopment analysis this allowance has been developed to entice designers to intentionally design or leave in place small closed depressions that can reduce the total volume required from a stormwater management pond the site designer is responsible to document downstream impacts if the closed depression were removed 15 drainage areas tributary to sinkholes shall be excluded from the modeled pointofinterest drainage areas defining predevelopment peak flows assumptions that sinkholes spill over during some storm events must be supported by acceptable documentation as determined by the municipal engineer in addition the design professional must be aware that bypassing or sealing sinkholes will frequently result in downstream flooding and should not be done if existing downstream flooding already occurs the site designer is responsible to document downstream impacts if the sinkhole were to stop taking stormwater runoff 16 ponds or other permanent pools of water are to be modeled by the methods established in the nrcss tr55 manual 1986 however more rigorous documented methods are acceptable with approval of the municipal engineer 17 the nrcs antecedent runoff condition ii arc ii previously amc ii must be used for all simulations the use of continuous simulation models that vary the arc are not permitted for stormwater management purposes in addition prior to any continuous simulation model being used in the spring creek basin for any other purposes the model unit hydrograph must be modified for common events in additional to extreme events based on indepth analysis of historical data from the basin 18 the following time of concentration tc computational methodologies shall be used unless another method is preapproved by the municipal engineer a predevelopment nrcss lag equation b postdevelopment  commercial industrial or other areas with large impervious areas greater than 20% impervious area nrcss segmental method c postdevelopment  residential cluster or other lowimpact designs less than or equal to 20% impervious area ncrss lag equation the time of concentration is to represent the average condition that best reflects the hydrologic response of the area for example large impervious areas bordered by small pervious areas may not consider the effect of the pervious areas in the tc computation if the designer wants to consider the effect of the pervious area runoff from the pervious and impervious  14715 patton code  14715  areas must be computed separately with the hydrographs being combined to determine the total runoff from the area under no circumstance will the postdevelopment tc be greater than the predevelopment tc for any watershed or subwatershed modeling purposes this includes when the designer has specifically used swales to reduce flow velocities in the event that the designer believes that the postdeveloment tc is greater it will still be set by default equal to the predevelopment tc for modeling purposes refer to  14715a28 regarding impervious area flashing iaf 19 the following postdevelopment minimum discharges are permitted for use with the nrcs cn runoff model 1year return period qpmin    da + 02 2year return period qpmin   003 da + 04 10year return period qpmin   009 da + 10 where da   the drainage area in acres qpmin   minimum allowable peak runoff rate in cfs a for return periods greater than 10 years the minimum discharge shall be equal to the computed predevelopment peak runoff rate b the minimum discharge criteria above are not appropriate for use with the rational method this is because these values were developed based on nrcs model corrections and do not actually represent a true physical process or discharge however common sense should be used by both the designer and reviewer in the evaluation of acceptable minimum discharges for use with the rational method c the intent of the minimum discharge is to allow reasonable runoff release from a site when a hydrologic model has produced a predevelopment runoff rate close to zero the method is not permitted for areas that previously drained completely into sinkholes in order to bypass the sinkhole after development d these minimum discharge values include the total of all stormwater management facilities discharges and undetained area discharges peak runoff rates for undetained fringe areas where the designer has made a realistic effort to control all new impervious areas will be computed using the predevelopment time of concentration for the drainage areas tributary to them undetained areas are those portions of the  14715 reserved  14715  site that cannot be routed to a stormwater management facility due to topography and typically include lower pond berms or small areas around entrance drives the site drainage areas used shall represent the predevelopment condition even if drainage areas are altered following development 20 all lined stormwater management ponds in carbonate and noncarbonated areas must be considered impervious and may not be used as pervious areas for stormwater management computations lined here means lined with synthetic liners or bentonite all other compacted soil liners will be considered to be hsg d for hydrologic computations 21 stormwater management ponds that have a capture depth for the purposes of water quality or volume capture shall assume a negligible discharge from these structures during design event routing only discharges from the primary principal spillway or emergency spillway need to be considered discharges from subsurface drains that tie into a principal spillway should not be considered during design event routing all subsurface drains may be required to be equipped with a restrictor plate with a oneinch opening in order to prevent the subsurface drain from functioning as a primary orifice consultation between the township engineer and design engineer shall take place to determine the feasibility of the application 22 stormwater management ponds that have a capture depth for the purposes of water quality or volume capture shall assume that the pond water quality or capture volume is full at the beginning of design event routing 23 stormwater management ponds must provide safe passage of the onehundredyear return period peak runoff rate assuming that all of the principal spillway orifices are fully clogged and the principal spillway overflow is 50% clogged a minimum of a sixinch freeboard must also be maintained above the resulting maximum water surface elevations any embankment emergency spillway can be assumed to be unclogged swm ponds with embankments completely made up of natural undisturbed soils fully in cut or where roadways act as the emergency spillway are permitted however the design engineer must verify downstream stability and control 24 all pre and postdevelopment comparisons of peak flows shall be rounded to tenths of a cfs the intent here is to recognize the accuracy and precision limitations of hydrologic modeling procedures again small differences between pre and postdevelopment discharge rates should be permitted when no negative downstream impacts will result  14715 patton code  14715  25 the full modified puls routing method must be used for stormwater management pond analyses simplified methods of determining pond size requirements such as those in tr55 1986 can only be used for preliminary pond size estimates 26 prepackaged hydraulic programs are not approved for the analysis of underground stormwater management facilities unless it can be verified that the program rounding subroutines used for the stage storage data do not affect the results this is because for very small storage volumes the program may round off the volume to a significant percentage 27 full supporting documentation must be provided for all stormwater management designs 28 designs must be checked for impervious area flash iaf this check is used to determine if flooding may occur due to poor modeling choices specifically related to the timeofconcentration this analysis requires that the watershed impervious area be modeled without the pervious areas the timeofconcentration should also be determined from the impervious areas only if the iaf analysis results in a higher peak runoff rate at a culvert or discharge from a pond this higher rate must be used for the final designcomparison the check will frequently yield higher values if a watersheds impervious area is located primarily near the watershed outlet or point of interest b pond capture volumes cv intent to minimize nuisance flooding from small precipitation events a runoff capture volume is required for all stormwater management ponds that do not discharge directly to natural welldefined with bed and banks perennial streams in general natural welldefined streams in the spring creek basin are limited to those delineated as usgs perennial streams this should be treated as a guideline and not a steadfast rule the final determination is at the discretion of the municipal engineer the pond capture volume is a volume of runoff that will be retained in a pond below the elevation of any free surface principal spillway orifice no principal spillway orifice except those connected to subsurface drains regardless of how small shall be below the pond elevation equivalent to this volume the centre county conservation district cccd receives numerous complaints regarding ponds that are located at the downslope edge of a property that result in discharging runoff onto downstream properties in an uncontrolled manner or where no existing defined outlet channel exists this is a very common problem in areas underlain by carbonate rock these discharges can cause erosion and flooding downstream while the pond capture volume is intended to minimize some of these negative effects it cannot deter or reduce the impacts form poor design practices therefore whenever possible the cccd recommends that the designer consider the downstream morphological changes that may occur and when possible consider constructing conveyance systems to  14715 reserved  14715  a stable natural channel in some chases this may require cooperation between landowners 1 the capture of volume is defined as a runoff depth of 025 inches from all impervious areas tributary to the stormwater management facility this volume will be allowed to infiltrate evaporate or dewater from a subsurface drain system connected directly to the facilitys principal spillway supporting computations that show that 90% of the capture volume can dewater in a maximum of 72 hours must be provided for surface ponds the maximum depth of ponding for the capture volume shall be three feet a health and safety precaution however in areas under karst influence a limiting maximum ponding depth of 18 inches is recommended designers may always increase the capture volume to a value greater than the minimum required as long as the maximum ponding depth criteria is met 2 to simplify computational requirements for design event analysis designers do not need to calculate discharges from subsurface drains related to the capture volumes if the filter media is sand or smaller than aashto 57 stone the capture volume is to control runoff rates from impervious areas and is not related to water quality however pond designs that include a water quality volume that is greater than the required capture volume are assumed to have also met the required capture volume as long as it dewaters as required 3 designs that rely on the natural infiltration of insitu soils must provide documentation supporting the infiltration rates used for analysis infiltration rates reported in the soil survey of centre county or other published rates may be used at the discretion of the municipal engineer 4 the pond capture volume shall always be used when upslope areas are developed where the ponds design creates a point discharge that did not previously existing 5 stormwater management detention facilities that connect directly to storm drain pipe networks that discharge to natural welldefined channels do not require a capture volume c recharge volumes rv intent the purpose of the recharge portion of the chapter is twofold first the recharge requirement is to mitigate the loss of groundwater recharge associated with the creation of impervious surfaces in addition the recharge criteria is to mitigate the increase in runoff volume associated with the creation of impervious surfaces this increase in runoff volume has significant impacts on downstream landowners these impacts are most often exhibited in the form of increased nuisance flooding and channel or drainageway erosion and instability according to local municipal engineers and representatives of the centre county conservation district these  14715 patton code  14715  problems are of significant local concern the magnitude of these problems increases with the percentage of impervious coverage created on a site 1 recharge mitigation shall be provided for runoff from all proposed impervious areas the required recharge volume shall be computed as 05 inches of runoff from all proposed impervious areas it is noted that lined detention ponds and compacted fill areas are considered to be impervious when calculating site impervious area for recharge considerations in addition land areas covered by paver blocks pervious pavement and other structural surface treatments which permit surface infiltration can be treated as pervious areas when calculating the site impervious area for recharge considerations as long as the structural infiltration practice is supported by sound design and appropriate construction specifications the municipal engineer may require submission of supporting documentation prior to approving structural infiltration areas as pervious areas 2 the following design practices can be used as credits to reduce the recharge volume requirement a residential roof areas detached duplex and townhome dwellings and commercialindustrial buildings with roof areas less than 5000 square feet can be removed from the

type of basin 11 basins should be lined with impervious liners only in areas with a high risk of sinkhole formation or potential groundwater contamination as determined by a geotechnical engineer however where a liner is deemed necessary or appropriate the use of controlled compacted natural clay liners for swm basins should be considered local available clay when properly installed can provide near impervious conditions approximately e6 cms or less a some of the advantages of using controlled compacted natural clay soil liners  can offer better longterm solution as a basin liner versus geosynthetics because of greater thickness and the ability to withstand settlement   can be constructed to allow relatively uniform leakage rates to facilitate groundwater recharge but not to an excessive degree that overloads karst bedrock   when properly constructed in two or more eighttoteninch thick lifts rapid movement of surface water clay liner is eliminated rapid leaks can occur in geosyntheticlined basins due to poor seaming punctures or other factors   cleaningmaintenance of claylined stormwater basins will be easiersafer versus geosynthetic liners which could easily be damaged during maintenance operations  and  the abundance of clayey soils derived from limestone residuum within the spring creek watershed can provide adequate costeffective soil resources for construction of clay liner systems at most development projects b however the installation of any lowpermeability clay liner system needs to be carefully controlled and the designer needs to ensure that specifications meet standards to ensure integrity 12 the depth of water in the pond should not exceed five feet 13 fence or screening a fence or suitable vegetative screening may be provided as

met a intent 1 when construction activities result in the disturbance and exposure of sulfurbearing minerals hereafter referred to as pyritic rock because pyrite is the most common of the base metal sulfides the unexpected consequences may be physical expansion as the sulfides oxidize and chemical as the soluble alteration products become mobile in runoff and groundwater a common effect of the latter known as acid rock drainage ard is the most widespread expansion in situ or from the use of pyritic rock as fill material in construction projects can lead to serious foundation and structural damage 2 construction of interstate highway 99 in the skytop area of the township resulted in the exposure of pyritic veins and the formation of ard causing public health concerns and requiring a very costly mitigation effort the extent and concentration of the pyrite veins encountered during that excavation was unexpected hence in the interest of public health and safety it is the intent of these regulations to regulate certain excavation activities in an effort to avoid hazards associated with the disturbance of pyritic rock b applicability  background 1 applicability these regulations shall

recommended stepbystep approach for proceeding with residential excavations when such activities are exempt from these regulations d further exemptions listed in  153f 2 background a the process in determining the appropriate course of action in assessing the potential for ard is based upon the extent of the planned excavation the topographic settings and subsurface conditions of the project site are integral to this determination b the term topographic setting relates to the characteristics of the ground surface of a project site while the term subsurface conditions refers to the geologies that are likely to be found in each topographic setting the following information is provided to help the onsite personnel understand the probability for ard in relationship to the settings and conditions c the three general settings in patton township can be referred to as ridge crest slopes and valley floor the two general subsurface conditions are soils and bedrock the top layer of bedrock is referred to as cap rock the following categories combine settings with the typical subsurface condition for that setting in order to provide a general probability for the existence of ardproducing conditions  setting a ridge crest with hazleton soils probability for ard a low if thin soil and thick oxidized cap rock 166 editors note appendix 7 is included at the end of this chapter

conditions only prior to beginning any excavation onsite personnel should review the above information for further assistance in assessing the potential for ard see also the flow chart in appendix 5 and appendix 4 subsurface conditions in three topographic settings167 those appendixes provide a visual depiction of the process and requirements contained within these regulations c definitions the definitions set forth below shall be applicable to this section acid rock  as used herein it refers to any rock soil regolith or fill in which an accumulation of sulfurbearing minerals produces sulfuric acid during weathering sulfur may be present as native sulfur s sulfide s2 or sulfate so4 the last two of which combine with iron or other elements to form minerals acid rock drainage ard  acid toxic surface water and groundwater draining from an oxidizing and hydrating sulfur source see photo below 167 editors note appendixes 4 and 5 are included at the end of this chapter  153 patton code  153  acid sulfate soils  soils in which sulfate minerals have precipitated from lateral and upward migrating ard leachate the process of migration and deposition is known as sulfuricization acid sulfate soils generally occur in flat lowlying areas down hydraulic gradient from oxidizing sulfide mineral deposits the secondary sulfate minerals that form near the surface from evaporation are called efflorescent minerals colluvium  unconsolidated sediments on a hill or mountainside ranging in size from large boulders down to sand and clay which were moved downhill due to gravity and deposited lower on the slope the rate of sediment movement is usually slow but rapid advancement can happen by landslides or mudslides many colluvial soils contain one or more brittle clayrich subsoil layers known as fragipans colluvial deposits may continue to move downhill normally at a slow rate transported soils colluvium particularly on ridge slopes may overlie and cover any of the in situ conditions fresh bedrock weathered bedrock residual soils efflorescent minerals  secondary minerals that precipitate at or near the earths surface from migration leachate and reflect in their composition the composition of the source materials although we are interested in those that formed from the oxidation and weathering of pyrite and other base metal sulfides we need to be aware of other aluminabearing efflorescent minerals such as alunite and alunogen formed from reactions with shale in treated fill site at skytop hydrated iron sulfate minerals such as copiapite and melanterite precipitated as finegrained powdery white to yellow to orange encrustations on rocks and construction materials at the surface or in the nearsurface environment efflorescent minerals are highly soluble in water and typically grow or disappear rapidly depending on local moisture conditions see photos below excavation  other than customary activities related to landscaping any disruption of the earths surface for activities including but not limited to clearing and grubbing the construction of buildings roads access drives driveways and accessory structures which results in one or more acres of earth disturbance when any of the following soil  153 reserved  153  types are present hazleton laidig buchanan andover murrill or clarksburg gossan  typically a hard rock or encrustation on the surface of another rock composed of iron oxidehydroxide minerals and quartz colored brown red orange and yellow any or all combinations they represent the oxidized and leached remnants of sulfide deposits on the weathered surface gossans form from oxidation and decomposition of pyritebearing rocks and others that host sulfide minerals the presence of gossan suggests that pyrite andor other sulfide minerals occur within nearby soil or bedrock see photo below oxidized cap rock  bedrock weathering in the nearsurface environment produces an oxidized and hydrated zone on which soil may be developed in general it mimics the surface topography in the skytop excavation the oxidized cap rock extended to depths of approximately 40 feet near the crest and thinned toward the slopes this zone of alteration includes the conversion of potentially toxic sulfide minerals to benign oxides and hydroxides and is referred to as the oxidized cap rock the depth of the alteration interface varies with rock type bedding attitude fracture density slope angle climate and erosion rate and in chemical terms represents a redox reductionoxidation front between oxidizing and reducing conditions there is a complex relationship between the fluctuating groundwater table and the redox front oxidized cap rock may be stripped off by rapid erosion or mass wasting eg landslides to directly expose fresh bedrock gossans are developed in oxidized cap rock over sulfide deposits in the skytop excavation the oxidized cap rock extended to depths of approximately 40 feet near the crest and thinned toward the slopes pyrite  an iron sulfide mineral characterized by a brassypale yellow color and metallic luster that superficially resembles gold if the crystals are large enough to be visible pyrite is typically seen as small cubes finergrained pyrite occurs as dispersed isolated crystals nearly invisible in a rock matrix or as aggregates of very small crystals that may coat fracture openings in rock or construction materials massive deposits of pyrite include small to large greater than one centimeter cubic crystals or rarely very small whisker crystals that comprise veins in bedrock these veins form in fractures long after the bedrock itself is consolidated such pyrite and related sulfide minerals such as galena and sphalerite is referred to as epigenetic pyrite associated with coal deposits is considered to be syngenetic  it formed contemporaneously with the coal and normally occurs in layered bedded form see photos below  153 patton code  153  pyritic rock  the term shall be deemed to include pyrite pyritebearing rock and sulfurbearing rock or minerals d inspection and testing no excavation shall be performed except upon submission of a report by an individual licensed

highly recommended that a landowner proceed in a manner similar to that which is provided herein 2 please see appendix 7 a residential guide to excavations and pyritic rock170 this guide is meant to assist landowners with a set of recommended procedures when pyritic rock is known or suspected to exist on site the procedures set forth in the guideline are highly advised though not required a specific intent where feasible patton township encourages the preservation of preexisting healthy noninvasive vegetation development process especially if that vegetation is mature trees already established trees and plants can reach maturity sooner and thus improve stormwater retention and effectively shade parking lots and buildings earlier however construction activity must avoid polluting or compacting the soil around these plants if they are to survive hence the following regulations are intended to protect trees designated by the developer for preservation from the construction process they are also intended to require the preservation of existing mature healthy trees within buffer yards where buildings are prohibited b any tree that exists before development but is proposed for preservation development process shall be noted on subdivisionland development plans unless that tree is part of a group more than 50 feet away from development activities tree protection zones shall be delineated on plans and marked on the ground around each of these designated trees during construction using a fence or similar barrier so as to protect the trees canopy and root zones from soil compaction excavation damage or hazardous materials c prior to the start of any site work the fences or barriers that mark the tree protection zones must be erected they must remain in place

district added 2271991 by   17534 intent a since its inception in the early 1950s the university park airport has continually expanded its size and services this airport growth creates potential impacts on the surrounding community including but not limited to the areas of transportation noise air and water pollution safety hazards need for public infrastructure and emergency services future land developments in the centre region will place greater demands on this facility and the neighboring largely undeveloped lands b in order to meet these demands land use compatibility between the airport and the neighboring lands is imperative prudent planning is essential and must relate to the development goals of the centre region municipalities as articulated in the comprehensive plan development of infrastructure must also be consistent with the impending airport growth to prevent problems and at the same time protect the environment recent studies have identified a significant potential source of groundwater immediately adjacent to the airport this valuable source of future water supply for the centre region must be protected from contamination c the planned airport district is designed to minimize airport hazards related to development of lands surrounding the university park airport and to minimize the potential for contamination of the potential well field located within the district it is also intended to promote the careful planning and orderly development of lands impacted by the airport consistent with the goals and objectives of patton township as described in the comprehensive plan in addition the district achieves additional purposes that include 1 provision of flexibility for land development while also providing for determination review and mitigation of potential community and environmental impacts associated with future airport development 2 promotion of the health safety and general welfare of the inhabitants of patton township by protecting them from the adverse effects of aircraft noise and preventing an increase in the number of people exposed to airportrelated hazards 3 prevention of the obstructions and incompatible land uses that affect navigable airspace 4 prevention of the development of land uses which tend to concentrate large numbers of people in the airport hazard areas  17534 vehicles recreational  17534   17535 establishment the area of patton township designated on the zoning map of the township as the planned airport district is hereby established as the planned airport district  17536 use regulations 5 encouragement of innovative design in the layout of buildings structures and open spaces and encouragement of a pattern of development which preserves trees and natural features and prevents soil erosion 6 provision of adequate water supply sanitary facilities stormwater management and other utilities and services 7 encouragement of innovative strategies to reduce transportation impacts from proposed development that will improve safety reduce congestion provide adequate access and promote the use of transportation demand management strategies 8 assurance that to the maximum extent possible the community is afforded the opportunity to participate in the development or amendment of the district 9 provision of criteria that allows a mix of land uses in a growth area served by public utilities with an emphasis on providing area for light industrial uses a uses by right 1 the specific uses permitted within different portions of the planned airport district are listed in table  these uses are a function of the noise levels projected to be generated by aircraft using the airport the proximity of a given area to the airport runways and flight approach paths and the desire to protect the nearby potential groundwater supply from contamination by activities conducted within the district 2 lines delineating residential mixed use and nonresidential areas within the planned airport district are to be depicted on and are to be considered an integral part of the zoning map the location of these lines are generally based on projected decibel levels contained in the report prepared by l robert kimball associates entitled noise analysis based on 8500 foot runway and corresponding operations at the university park airport dated  the location of these lines is to be considered a fixed part of the zoning map and their location can only be changed by amendment of the zoning map 201 editors note table 1 is included at the end of this chapter  17534 patton code  17536   17537 procedure for master plan approval all development within the planned airport district must be done pursuant to approval of a master plan in accordance with the procedure that follows

planning commission and shall be approved or denied by the board of supervisors in accordance with the procedures specified herein parcels smaller than 20 3 in order to protect the safety of persons on the ground and within aircraft additional safety measures as established by the federal aviation administration will be made part of this chapter these safety measures are identified as the runway protection zone runway approach zone and horizontal clearance zone the runway and approach areas based on the federal aviation administration runway protection zone and runway approach zone respectively are to be depicted on and are to be considered an integral part of the zoning map and their location can only be changed by amendment of the zoning map the entire planned airport district lies within the horizontal clearance zone b the concern for protection of the potential future source of groundwater identified in the airport area is embodied within table 2202 which prohibits certain activities from being conducted in the planned airport district that could contaminate the potential water supply in addition a buffer of at least 150 feet shall be required from all designated well sites this buffer shall be measured from the perimeter of the designated sites vegetation andor a combination of low maintenance trees shrubs and ground cover plantings shall be

adequate setbacks and landscaping the basic approach discussed here establishes a buffer between the interstate highway rightofway and all development and standards for landscaping along the interchange access road and in and around parking lots 2 concern about the impacts of development on safety the future scenic character around the interchanges and the environment prompted the creation of this section trees and other landscaping are required within and around parking lots for highway beautification as seen from the interstate or interchange access road  to improve safety by reducing diagonal travel across traffic patterns  and to minimize environmental impacts by reducing heat build up and stormwater runoff volume and velocity furthermore the planting materials section requires that new plantings use at least 50% vegetation native to central pennsylvania native species tend to be more tolerant of local environmental conditions and tend to be healthier reducing the need for watering pesticides and nutrient applications on the other hand the standard still provides flexibility for other plant selections invasive species are excluded from use because of their nuisance capacity and adverse impact on other valued plants and animals b setbacks 1 all proposed development to be located within the interstate highway and interchange access road corridors shall meet the following setback requirement a a minimum setback of 75 feet from the edge of the mainline portion of the rightofway of the interstate highway this setback shall not apply to parcels abutting

their relationship to the immediate surroundings provide some of the most significant influences on the character of a community community character especially along welltraveled routes is an important contributor to property values and strong economic development as such these regulations aim to reinforce two of the main intentions of the interchange overlay district to provide for uniformity of standards and highway beautification the standards provided here will be equitable for all who develop but more importantly they will provide a consistency to the development character thereby enabling the longterm preservation of property values and the promotion of economic development both valid legal rationales for regulation by municipalities for example expansive blank walls of retail uses facing a street contribute very little to the life and vitality of that location therefore the standards here for groundfloor display windows and a primary entry facing the interchange access road reflect retail building qualities found in the townships originally settled crossroads villages and towns many zoning codes in other municipalities in pennsylvania require that new structures have features similar to those of existing or historic neighborhood buildings b specific building and site requirements in subdivision and land development chapter the specific requirements for building exteriors and building placement and site design are found in subdivision and land development  153342 design standards i99 interchange overlay district c underground infrastructure 1
