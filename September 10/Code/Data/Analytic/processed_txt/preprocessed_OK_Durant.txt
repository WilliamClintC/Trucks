the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage cstatement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1protect human life and health  2minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4minimize prolonged business interruptions  5minimize damage to public facilities

of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area dmethods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4control filling grading dredging and other development which

as to legal provisions which are pertinent to the subdivision much of the reason for this step is to make the transfer of the land more simple and certain land sales by reference to a legally filed plat are generally less complicated and more likely to provide the precise legal situation sought the certainty of such sales derives from the assurance of an accurate survey and processes designed to assure the provision of facilities necessary to service the land bat the time the final plat and final plat checklist are submitted to the community development department the subdivider shall take

development is dependent on the quality of design of the individual subdivisions in the area good community design can be accomplished by following a few principles these better approaches to the layout of new areas the violation of some of the basic rules concerning design of streets ditches and other features can lead to such unpleasant situations as streets that deteriorate and are expensive to maintain street intersections that are dangerous drainage ditches that clog up and cause flooding building lots that are difficult or expensive to construct upon or difficulties with erosion during the time of development and even throughout the life of the homes bthe figures which follow show some of the better ways of creating a subdivision the use of good design and holding to these methods of development can provide for the least expense in the building of a subdivision this is especially true considering the costs that come to the purchasers of property that has been improperly developed and the fact that there is no cheaper time to solve development problems than before houses are built and lots are sold cfigure 1 shows some of the patterns of streets and lots that might be possible in the development of areas in large rural estates type lots in the shaded area is shown an all too frequent approach to the creating of lots in rural settings there are a number of problems from the arrangement of lots in a road frontage strip as in the shaded area such as 1long narrow parcels which are of reduced usefulness to the buyer  2increased numbers of driveways intersecting the section line road this is a major problem to the county as it tries to keep ditches and culverts clean and working  3the narrower lots result in closer spacing of houses with less privacy and greater possibility of failure in the operation of individual sewer systems  and 4athe frontage of each house upon a section line road means greater exposure to the dust traffic litter and drainage problems which occur along the major roads also there is a loss of privacy and the danger that the road may have to be widened at some time in the future taking part of the front lawn bon the other hand some of the other styles of lot arrangements shown can provide lots of much more usable shape more privacy safer traffic more workable utility layout better spacing of buildings and the like dthe majority of land developed in the manner shown in figure 1 is expected to be in the jurisdiction of the regional planning commission outside the incorporated area of the city ethese are not all of the possibilities for laying out a large lot development in fact a development usually turns out better if it is worked out to fit the shape of the particular piece of land considering the streams hills and the like however from this figure it can be seen that almost any other arrangement is better than a strip of long narrow lots along the frontage of a major road figure 1 rural platting patterns  images0006017jpg  notes1property dimensions in many cases are shown as less the right ofway dimension this reflects the improvement of the street or road and dedication of it to the public 2covenants should provide for access to lots to be only from side roads figure 2 an example of good subdivision design  images0006020jpg  notes1minor streets should be designed to provide access in a manner to discourage use by collector streets should be designed to provide a direct route from minor streets to major streets 3ingress and egress to residential

necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation from traffic  cwhere a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad rightofway of limited access highway

channels shall be aprimary drainage channels  and bsecondary drainage channels 2in general it is intended that channels which are designated as primary channels serve a drainage area of 1000 acres or more it is intended by these regulations that the improvement of primary drainage channels shall be primarily the responsibility of the community as a whole since the whole community is materially benefitted however the developer of the land containing a primary channel is expected to layout design and otherwise plan and carry out his or her improvements in a manner that will not interfere with or restrict the natural flow of water or materially change the condition of runoff increased runoff and changes in primary channels which are created by improvements of an individual subdivision shall be the responsibility of the developer of the subdivision and shall be made in accordance with the provisions of these regulations it is intended by these regulations that the improvement of a secondary channel shall be the responsibility of the developer of the area served by the channel since the primary benefit is to the area served by the secondary channel and not to the community as a whole cthe maximum condition of rainfall for a 100year interval plus one foot of freeboard shall be used for the purposes of determining all runoff for the sizing of drainage channels and structures
