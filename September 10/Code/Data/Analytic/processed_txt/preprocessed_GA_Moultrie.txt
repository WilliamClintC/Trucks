and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise

minor subdivisions minor subdivisions provide certain advantages such as a shorter application process and less public scrutiny that tend to favor their use over the filing of major subdivision applications given these advantages the prospect exists that subdividers may seek to divide a parcel via consecutive andor contiguous minor subdivisions instead of filing for a major subdivision it is the intent of the mayor and city council to prohibit the practice of chain subdivisions where the 34 same land owner subdivides land and then files minor subdivision applications on common contiguous parcels which collectively total more than four lots it is also the intent of the mayor and city council to prohibit minor subdivisions adjacent to each other within a threeyear time period in cases where part of an original tract of land is now owned by another person or entity and was transferred or sold to another owner with the apparent intent to circumvent the major subdivision process common contiguous parcels shown on minor subdivision plats contiguous common parcels as defined by this shall be referenced on all applications for minor subdivisions and contiguous common parcels

was part of an original tract and if the property proposed to be subdivided abuts land that has been divided as a minor subdivision in the last three years then minor subdivision of said property shall be prohibited this provision shall not be construed to prohibit the approval of two contiguous minor subdivisions under separate ownership  however this provision is intended to be construed liberally so that one property owner does not develop a minor subdivision on part of an original tract and transfer or sell another part of the original tract for the purposes of minor subdivision within a three year period it is the intent that land abutting a minor subdivision that was owned by the subdivider of the abutting minor subdivision shall not be subdivided as a minor subdivision for a period of three years regardless of ownership 35 private streets permitted private streets may upon application be permitted by the mayor and city council within major subdivisions subject to the
