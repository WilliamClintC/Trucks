own and have a certain respect for the territory of others fences pavement treatments art signs good maintenance and landscaping are some physical ways to express ownership identifying intruders is much easier in a welldefined space  natural surveillance criminals dont want to be seen placing physical features activities and people in ways that maximize the ability to see whats going on discourages crime barriers such as bushes sheds or shadows make it difficult to observe activity landscaping and lighting can be planned to promote natural surveillance from inside a home or building and from the outside by neighbors or people passing by maximizing the natural surveillance capability of such gatekeepers as parking lot attendants and hotel desk clerks is important  activity support encouraging legitimate activity in public spaces helps discourage crime a basketball court in a public park or community center will provide recreation for youth while making strangers more obvious and increasing active natural surveillance and the feeling of ownership any activity that gets people out and working together  a cleanup day a block party a neighborhood watch group a civic meeting  helps prevent crime  access control properly located entrances exits fencing landscaping and lighting can direct both foot and automobile traffic in ways that discourage crime access control can be as simple as a neighbor on the front porch or the strategic location of a front office other strategies include development of a welldesigned street system to discourage on local streets or introducing

purposes a statutory authorization 1 the legislature of the state of kansas has in ksa 12741 et seq and specifically in ksa 12766 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare therefore the governing body of the city of goodland kansas ordains as follows b findings of fact 1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of the city of goodland kansas are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c statement of purpose 1 it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in 1  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 federal regulations cfr 5922a3  and to meet the requirements of 44 cfr 603b and kar 5444 by applying the provisions of this chapter to a restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities  b require uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities that serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction  and c protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard art 10  1 12301 general provisions a lands to which this this chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city of goodland kansas identified as unnumbered a zones on the flood insurance rate map firm dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto this chapter shall additionally apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city of goodland kansas that have not been mapped on a firm or a flood hazard boundary map fhbm and have been identified by the community as having the presence of floodprone areas in all areas covered by this chapter no development shall be permitted except issuance of a floodplain development permit granted by the governing body or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the governing body or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare health of the inhabitants of the community and as specifically noted in b compliance no development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located extended converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations c abrogation and greater restrictions it is not intended by this chapter to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this chapter imposes greater restrictions the provisions of this chapter shall prevail all other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only d interpretation in their interpretation and application the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by kansas statutes e warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris this chapter does not imply that areas outside unnumbered a zones or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage this chapter shall not create a liability on the part of city of goodland kansas any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder f severability if any section clause provision or portion of this
