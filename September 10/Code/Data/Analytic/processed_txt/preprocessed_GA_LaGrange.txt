density standard for new development for the purposes of this section redevelopment is defined as one or more of the following a demolition of an existing building and rebuilding on the site  b expansion of the gross square feet of the impervious surface on the site by more than fifty 50 percent 3 expansions and additions to multifamily and nonresidential sites when expansion of a site equals no more than fifty 50 percent of the preexisting impervious surface gross square footage the tree density standard shall be required and calculated based on the amount of disturbed area for the expansion expansion by more than fifty 50 percent of the existing impervious surface gross square feet shall be considered redevelopment and subject to the requirements of subsection a2 above b the term unit is not synonymous with tree the density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development and may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved planting new trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this chapter or some combination of the two 2 as represented by the formula sdf   edf + rdf where sdf site density factor   the minimum tree

hardwoods and softwood trees such as pines and cedars must be at least twentyfour 24 inches in diameter at breast height to be considered a specimen tree 2 small native flowering trees must be at least twelve 12 inches in diameter at breast height to be considered a specimen tree 3 condition criteria a life expectancy of greater than fifteen 15 years b relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay c no major insect or pathological problems d no major pruning deficiencies ie topping e at least seventyfive 75 percent of the critical root zone in a natural undisturbed state f a species on the citys approved tree list b it is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees reasonable efforts shall include but not be limited to alternate building design building location parking area layout parking area location reduction in parking area to the minimum required water retention location and the like c in order to encourage the preservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects additional density credit will be given for specimen trees which are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose credit for any specimen tree thus saved would be two 2 times the assignment value shown in table a in section 251136d d if a specimen tree must be removed it shall be replaced by a species with potential for comparable size and quality species selection is subject to approval of the community development director or city arborist tree replacement in recompense for specimen tree removal shall be in addition to the minimum required tree density e except as exempted no specimen tree may be removed without prior written approval from the community development director any specimen tree which is removed without the appropriate review and approval of the community development director must be replaced by trees with a minimum caliper size of five 5 inches per tree with a total density equal to three 3 times the unit value of the tree removed in addition the city may issue a citation for the removal of a specimen tree without the appropriate city review and approval size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval f in the event any specimen tree is damaged during construction or as a result of construction and does not survive more than sixty 60 months following completion of development the owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees threeinch minimum caliper having an inch for inch replacement of the specimen tree removed on the site g the community development director or city arborist may identify and require the preservation of a tree stand if it contains one 1 or more specimen tree and the trees are interlocked with other members of the stand in such a manner as to imperil the individual tree if other members of the stand were to be removed h in order to facilitate specimen tree preservation a variance to the dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance may be an appropriate remedy to preserve a specimen tree where in the opinion of the community development director one 1 or more variances would enable a site and building design to be accomplished while saving one 1 or more specimen trees and where the objectives of tree protection would outweigh the purposes of the zoning regulations that would be varied the community development director may suggest an applicant apply for variances instead of proposing to remove one 1 or more specimen trees a determination by the community development director that one 1 or more variances to the dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance would not be appropriate may support a finding by the community development director in favor of granting approval to remove one 1 or more specimen trees  102814 phased projects where development is going to occur

state of georgia and ocga  36120a have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the city of lagrange georgia ordains the following  62612 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of lagrange georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately

purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  2 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  3 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion and  4 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  5 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  62612 article ii  definitions definitions unless

purposes of the zone are a to encourage orderly staged development of comprehensively planned multiuse centers by providing procedures for various zoning and plan approvals including development phasing  b to encourage design flexibility and coordination of architectural style of buildings and signage  c to ensure the integration and internal compatibility of applicable residential and nonresidential uses by providing a suitable residential environment that is enhanced and complimented by commercial recreational open space employment and institutional uses and amenities within all land use components of the multiuse project  d to ensure compatibility of the proposed land uses with internal and surrounding uses by incorporating higher standards of land planning and site design than could be accomplished under conventional zoning categories and to provide a superior quality of development exceeding that which could be achieved under conventional zoning regulations and procedures  e to encourage the efficient use of land by locating employment and retail uses convenient to residential areas  reducing reliance on automobile use and encouraging pedestrian and other nonvehicular circulations systems  retaining and providing usable open space and active recreation areas close to employment and residential population  and providing for the development of
