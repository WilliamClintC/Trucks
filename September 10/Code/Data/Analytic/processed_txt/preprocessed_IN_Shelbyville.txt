concentration or mass limits in accordance with divisions b5 and 6 2when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the authority may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users 3when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the authority shall impose an

intake water if the requirements of division 4b of this section are met bcriteria 1either athe applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or bthe industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters 2credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere 3credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this section 4credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result 5when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city of shelbyville convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the authority the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in divisions b5a1 b5a5 below ato be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user

monitoring device  3continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the authority whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20% from its baseline production rates determined in division b5a3 upon notification of a revised production rate the authority will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 4continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to division b4a1 of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit cwhen developing equivalent mass limits the authority 1will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  2upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 3may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for

does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations passed 101714  15902 findings of fact athe flood hazard areas of the city of shelbyville are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated inadequately floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages passed 101714  15903 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to arestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters dcontrol filling grading
