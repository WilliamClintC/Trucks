the mayor and council of the city hereby declare it to be the purpose and intent of this regulation to establish a uniform procedure for the protection enhancement perpetuation and use of the north cherokee road and south cherokee road corridor and social circle parkway and north cherokee road and south cherokee road and social circle parkway corridor corridors in social circle as the corridor has a direct impact on places districts sites buildings structures and works of art with special historical cultural or aesthetic interests or values suburban sprawl and roadside commercial developments when set into a traditional quasirural community with valuable historic buildings such as social circle can produce an adverse effect on city character and quality of life conventional planning models and zoning ordinances can produce linear development homogeneous architecture large expanses of asphalt and a proliferation of signage careful planning particularly along heavily traveled and developed corridors such as the corridors can allow new developments to be successfully blended into the existing city without compromising the unique character of social circle the purpose of this ordinance is to implement the development of appropriate regulations and planning techniques to protect social circles entry corridor along the corridors the city also seeks to enhance open space conservation the mayor and council recognize commercial strip development spawns traffic congestion extensive and competing signage and incompatible architecture in order to preserve social circles rural ambiance and historic elements guidelines are necessary to prevent the emergence and expansion of long linear commercial strips within the corridors the primary goal of this ordinance is to protect the character of these gateways while utilizing appropriate standards and criteria to direct future development in harmony with the city the objectives also include the safe and efficient use of the roadways and the encouragement of quality sensible development in harmony with the rural character and historic elements of social circle a further purpose is limitation on linear shopping centers and the parking lots associated therewith the construction of new smaller scale traditional buildings along the roadside and frontage can assist in achieving the desired effect by buffering views of asphalt lots the city also seeks to enhance open space conservation by taking a parcel of land calculating the number of lots by conventional zoning then reducing the buildable land and reducing lot sizes accordingly the remaining undeveloped land may be set aside as a permanent conservation easement or for noncommercial use the city wishes to focus upon the compatibility of forms scale massing and materials such that new structures will conform to neighboring community features and standards and more closely reflect the rural character and historic elements of the community new structures should be reasonably harmonious with existing traditional buildings in social circle and its rural surroundings height mass and roof shape are important elements more specifically see

isolated from their surroundings all design elements including without limitation buildings and appurtenances landscape design and vegetation parking driveways walkways signage and lighting should be coordinated to create a continuous and harmonious streetscape where possible building appurtenances should be shared 4 landscape design shall be an integral component retention of existing vegetation is encouraged adequate provision of new landscaping areas at the frontage along the property perimeters and within pavement areas is essential landscape plans should utilize preferred plant materials

the location size placement and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods services and facilities in the city without difficulty and confusion to improve the general attractiveness of the community to take advantage of the beauty of the communitys environment and to protect property values the goal of this article is to avoid being an impermissible contentbased regulation and instead to be a permissible time place and manner restriction more communication is desirable during the election cycle so that all citizens may freely express their viewpoints during the election campaigns and therefore this ordinance allows increased opportunities for signs during these periods without limiting content at all times any sign permitted under this regulation can carry any legal message political or nonpolitical commercial or noncommercial however it is not the intent of this article that all signs are built to the maximum size the city encourages use of the minimum signage necessary to meet the purposes required accordingly it is the intention of the city to establish regulations governing signs which will 1 promote and protect the public health safety and general welfare  2 protect the character of the citys historic commercial district and residential neighborhoods  3 enhance the economy of the city by promoting the reasonable orderly and effective display of signs  4 restrict signs and lights which increase clutter or which increase the probability of traffic accidents by obstructing vision  5 promote signs compatible with their surroundings further recognizing that the aesthetic cultural and historic qualities of the city are unique and therefore vital to the communitys interest it is the objective of this article to protect these and to ensure that these are not compromised it is an objective of this article to protect and preserve the aesthetic qualities of the community by regulating the number size placement installation and maintenance of signs the fact that such signs are intended to command visual contact grants to signs a proportionally greater role than other structures in determining the overall aesthetic quality of the community the aesthetic impact of signs has an economic factor that can bear heavily upon the enjoyment and value of property  therefore the regulation of signs is validly justified on the basis of conserving the value of property and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the community it is both rational and important for a communitys citizens to plan their physical surroundings so unsightliness is minimized signs can detract from the beauty of a neighborhood and lower property values in seeking to comply with federal and georgia law the city council has determined the following large billboards are as the us supreme court has recognized an aesthetic harm  the georgia supreme court has upheld sign regulations on the basis of aesthetics and preserving the beauty of environment  and judicial decisions of the eleventh circuit have recognized that portable signs are visual clutter and a potential traffic hazard these holdings support the constitutionality of this chapter as intended by the city with these purposes in mind it is the intention of this article to authorize the use of signs that 1 are compatible with their surroundings 2 are appropriate to the type of activity to which they pertain 3 are expressive of the identity of the individual properties or of the community as a whole 4 are legible to avoid illegal signage anyone
