flooding and to provide data supporting the design of facilities to be constructed for the management of rainfall runoff each drainage report must consider rainfall runoff from storms with a return frequency up to and including a one hundredyear storm the complexity of the report depends upon the nature of the development and the site on which the development will occur a drainage report shall

chapter 2  appeal to superior court when those aggrieved by the decision of the floodplain board or any taxpayer may appeal the decision to the superior court of pinal county 3  floodplain board to considercriteria the variance criteria set forth in this chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance should be quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this section are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate in passing upon applications the floodplain board shall consider its directive as set forth above all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of the chapter and athe danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  bthe danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  cthe susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of the damage on the individual owner  dthe importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  ethe necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  fthe availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  gthe compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  hthe relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  ithe safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  jthe expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and kthe costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges part 2007  prior code  17614  granting of variance when generally variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level provided subsections a k have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 5  conditions for issuance of variance upon consideration of the factors of the purposes of this chapter the floodplain board may attach the conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of the chapter 6  records to be maintained the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance and appeal actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report to the federal emergency management agency part 2007  prior code  17617  exceptions variances may be issued for the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this article part 2007  prior code  17621  variances denied when variances shall not be

cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water  and da determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances part 2007  prior code  17624  written notice of variance issuance required any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the regulatory flood elevation that such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property and that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage the notice will also state that the land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of state land pursuant to the flood relocation and land exchange program provided for by ars title 26 a
