follows a the city of st helena pursuant to the police powers delegated to it by the california constitution has the authority to enact laws which promote the public health safety and general welfare of its residents b the occurrence of a party gathering or event on private property where alcohol controlled substances intoxicating substances andor marijuana are served to consumed by or in the possession of an underage person is a threat to the public health safety or quiet enjoyment of residential property and the general welfare c state law makes it unlawful for a person under the age of twentyone 21 years to purchase or attempt to purchase or consume alcoholic beverages controlled substances intoxicating substances andor marijuana and makes it unlawful for any person to sell or provide any alcoholic beverage controlled substances intoxicating substances andor marijuana to any person under the age of twentyone 21 years d law enforcement response to a party gathering or event where alcohol controlled substances intoxicating substances andor marijuana are served to consumed by or in the possession of an underage person causes a drain of law enforcement resources and in some situations leaves other areas of the city with inadequate law enforcement protection responses to such gatherings or events result in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources which are underwritten by general municipal taxes paid to the city by its taxpayers and residents e according to the california healthy kids survey 2009 thirty percent 30% of city of st helena eleventh graders report obtaining alcohol at parties or other events outside school and seventyeight percent 78% of city of st helena eleventh graders report that alcohol is fairly easy or very easy to obtain alcohol policy research regarding underage drinking shows that when communities reduce youth access to alcohol communities experience reductions in youth alcohol use and related problems ordinances that reduce youth access to alcohol from social sources have been recognized as a best practice by the united states department of justice the city council believes this finding and the studies upon which it is based applies similarly if not equally to controlled substances intoxicating substances andor marijuana f communities that have adopted such ordinances have seen reductions in the size of gatherings and reductions in youth perception of ease of access to alcohol controlled substances intoxicating substances andor marijuana g law enforcement ability to abate gatherings where alcohol controlled substances intoxicating substances andor marijuana are consumed by minors on private property will result in decrease in abuse of alcohol controlled substances intoxicating substances andor marijuana by minors physical altercations and injuries sexual assaults truancy driving under the influence of alcohol adolescent crime motor vehicle crashes neighborhood vandalism and excessive noise disturbance thereby improving public safety and overall quality of life of st helena residents h persons held responsible for abetting or allowing a party gathering or event where alcohol controlled substances intoxicating substances andor marijuana are served to consumed by or in the possession of an underage person will be more likely to properly supervise or to stop such conduct at gatherings held on property in their possession or under their control i problems associated with a party gathering or event at which alcoholic beverages controlled substances intoxicating substances andor marijuana are served to consumed by or in the possession of underage persons are difficult to prevent or deter unless law enforcement has the additional legal authority to issue a civil citation for a

employee transportation survey during a survey week 2 avr is calculated only for those employees who start work or are assigned to the work site during the peak period 3 if less than sixty percent 60% of the survey forms are returned for processing from those employees who start work during the peak period all survey forms not returned from those employees who start work during the peak period shall be counted as singleoccupant vehicles for purposes of calculating avr or ver 4 if sixty percent 60% or more of the survey forms are returned for processing from those employees who start work during the peak period onehalf of those survey forms not returned from those employees who start work during the peak period shall be assumed to have the same avr or ver as that calculated from the responses to the surveys returned and onehalf shall be counted as singleoccupant vehicles for purposes of calculating avr or ver 5 avr for the work site shall be calculated by dividing the total employeedays for the survey week by the total vehicle tripdays for the survey week 6 ver for the work site shall be calculated by dividing the total vehicle tripdays for the survey week by the total employeedays for the survey week a employeedays shall be determined as follows the total number of employees who start work or are assigned to a work site during the peak period each work day monday of the survey week each day of the survey week that an employee starts work during the peak period counts as one employeeday for example an employee who starts work each day monday of the survey week between six am and ten am counts as five employeedays the following procedures are used in totaling employeedays i employees telecommuting or are off due to a compressed work week schedule are counted as reporting to the work site in calculating the total employeedays ii the following employees are not included in the employeedays total a employees not working because of vacation sickness or other timeoff  b employees who report to a different work site or an offsite work related activity  c disabled employees b vehicle tripdays shall be determined as follows the total number of vehicles used by employees who start work or are assigned to the work site each work day monday of the survey week a vehicle tripday is based on the means of transportation used for the greatest distance of an employees home to work commute trip an employee who starts work during the peak period and arrives at the work site each day of the survey week monday in a singleoccupant vehicle count as five vehicle tripdays the following numerical values are used in calculating the total vehicle tripdays i singleoccupant vehicle drive alone equals one ii carpool equals one divided by the number of people in the carpool iii vanpool equals one divided by the number of employees in the vanpool iv motorcycle moped motorized scooter or motor bike equal one v cleanfueled vehicles are counted as follows a electric vehicle equals zero  b compressed natural gas vehicle equals onefourth  c propane vehicle equals onehalf  d dual or flexible fueled vehicle equals threefourths vi the following all equal zero vehicle tripdays a public transit bus light rail ferry caltrain bart  b private buspool or club bus  c bicycle  d waling and other nonmotorized transportation modes  e employees telecommuting only on the days those employees are telecommuting for the entire day  f employees who work a compressed work week schedule only on their compressed days off  g disabled employee vehicles at all times 7 employers with multiple work sites within the city have the option to average individual work site avr or ver to demonstrate that the performance objectives are achieved on an aggregate basis for those work sites when the city is implementing the chapter if the employer demonstrates that the performance objectives subsection d of this section are achieved using the averaging methodology then those work sites included in the averaging are not subject to the requirements of subsection h of this section a the weighted avr average of the multiple work sites is calculated by 1 adding together the employeedays for each work site  2 adding together the vehicle tripdays for each work site  then 3 dividing the aggregate employeedays by the aggregate vehicle tripdays to obtain the weighted avr average b the weighted ver average for the multiple work sites is calculated by dividing the aggregate vehicle tripdays by the aggregate employeedays c the weighted ver average for multiple work sites can also be calculated as the number of peak period employees multiplied by ver site 1 plus the number of peak period employees multiplied by ver site 2 divided by the total peak period employees sites 1 and 2 l random sample method the method described in this subsection must be followed when an employer chooses to use a random sample to meet the requirements of subsection k of this section 1 summary a g3 of this section provides an option for larger work sites to calculate avr or ver based upon a random sample of the employee population the random sample option is available only for work sites where four hundred 400 or more employees start work during the peak period six am am b the size of the random sample depends upon the number of employees who start work during the peak period at the work site the means to determine the minimum size of the random sample is described in subsection l2b of this section c the sample must be selected as described in subsection l2d of this section once the sample group has been selected the employer is not permitted to send additional survey forms to employees beyond the original sample group this will invalidate the results of the survey and void the employers option to utilize the random sample method d a high response rate is critical to ensure that the random sample produces an accurate avr or ver for the work site the employer should make a concerted effort to obtain a completed survey from each employee in the sample all nonrespondents in the sample will be treated as drive alone commuters ie commuting in a singleoccupant vehicle for purposes of calculating the work site avr or ver 2 basic random sample selection methodology a the employer shall compile a complete list of employees at the work site in alphabetical order and assign a consecutive number to each employee the employer shall exclude from the list employees who are known to regularly start work outside the six am am peak period b the employer shall determine the number of employees to be included in the random sample using the following formula where n is the sample size and n is the number of employees who start work between six am and ten am n   n 1 + 0026n1 a sample of size n based on this formula should produce an avr or ver with a sampling error of at most plus or minus 005 with ninetyfive percent 95% probability the sample size based on this formula is displayed in the table below number of peak period employees @ work site sample size 400 to 420 200 421 to 440 205 441 to 460 210 461 to 480 214 481 to 500 218 501 to 550 225 551 to 600 235 601 to 650 240 651 to 700 248 701 to 750 255 751 to 800 260 801 to 850 265 851 to 900 270 901 to 950 274 951 to 1000 278 1001 to 1500 300 1501 to 2000 320 2001 to 3000 340 3001 to 4000 350 4001 to 6000 360 6001 to 10000 370 >10000 c in no case can the random sample size be less than indicated in the above table the employer may choose to include a larger number of employees in the survey a larger sample group should more accurately represent the entire employee population  provided that the employer obtains a high response rate d after the sample size has been determined the employer has two options for selecting the sample i use a computer program to select distinct random numbers from the employee list eg two hundred seventyeight 278 distinct random numbers between one and one thousand 1000 where one thousand 1000 employees start work during the peak period  ii select employees from the list based upon a sampling interval and random starting number to determine the sampling interval the employer shall divide the total population of employees who start work during the six am am peak period by the sample size and round the result down to the nearest integer example if a work site has one thousand 1000 employees who start work during the peak period and the sample size is two hundred seventyeight 278 then the sampling interval equals 1000 divided by 278   36 the 36 is rounded down to 3 to produce the sampling interval therefore every third name on the list shall be selected beginning at a random starting number x where x is between 1 and 3 if x equals 3 then the sample would include numbers 3 6 9 12 15 etc until the required two hundred seventyeight 278 numbers have been selected e the methodology described in subsection l2d of this section will eliminate potential bias that could result from choosing survey participants on the basis of department rank income level home zip code or other demographic factors or from excluding certain segments of the employee population 3 selection process for subsequent surveys a in subsequent surveys the employer may select the random sample using the method described in subsection l2 of this section or the employer may choose to survey the same employees that were included in the previous random sample employees in the previous random sample group who have left the organization shall be replaced in the new sample by employees selected per subsection l2 of this section the latter approach may enable the employer to more accurately track changes in commute mode from one survey to the next b if the number of employees who start work between six am and ten am has increased or decreased by more than twenty percent 20% since the last survey the employer shall select a completely new random sample group using the methodology described in subsection l2 of this section 4 performance objective calculation reporting and recordkeeping a avr or ver must be calculated according to the methodology described in subsection k of this section notwithstanding the provision of subsection k4 of this section any employee in the random sample group who fails to submit a completed survey form shall be included in the performance objective calculation as a drive alone commuter singleoccupant vehicle b the employer shall submit to the city i the completed survey forms for processing or the results of the survey according to the schedule in subsections g7 or g8 of this section  ii a description of the methodology used to select the random sample  and iii a tally showing the number of surveys distributed the number completed and the number of nonrespondents c the employer shall retain records needed to document adherence to this protocol for a period of at least three years including the master list used to generate the random sample and the names and numbers selected from that list such records files and documentation shall be made available to the city during any onsite audit conducted by the city 61  violationspenalties any person failing to comply with provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine of not more than one hundred

has been approved by the department 37 water management plan purpose  allocation of water resources  effects of allocation  purpose the city of st helena recognizes that its sources of water are limited and therefore that it must conserve and manage water resources to achieve adopted land use planning objectives the citys water resources are currently and for the foreseeable future derived from three sources the city of napa under its longterm water supply contract with the city of st helena  bell canyon reservoir  and groundwater from cityowned and operated wells it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to establish a water management program that a provides a process for dedication of the citys limited water resources in new development  and b establishes a process for determining the broad land use categories to be served of water resources during periods when the city is not by resolution of the city council declared to be in any water shortage emergency phase pursuant to of  part  allocation of water resources a allocation following a public hearing the city council shall establish an allocation of water resources when the city is not in a declared water shortage emergency pursuant to adopting an allocation resolution the resolution shall define 1 the quantity of water in acrefeet available to the city for allocation during the july 1st th water year  2 a list of defined land use or project categories for which water will be made available  3 a discrete quantity of water expressed in acrefeet to be allocated to each defined land use category  and 4 a discrete quantity of water to be held in unallocated reserves b unallocated reserves water held in unallocated reserves shall not be used for any purpose or land use change until transferred to a defined allocation category such transfers shall be made of a new allocation resolution in conformity with subsection a of this section c term of the allocation resolution in the absence of a declared water shortage emergency the allocation resolution shall remain in effect until replaced by a subsequent resolution pursuant to subsection a of this section  part  effects of allocation the purpose and effect of establishing categories of water supplies are to limit access to water to those categories that are consistent with the general plan no change in land use shall be allowed permit or license that could result in a net increase in water use unless such change has been approved in accordance with all applicable provisions of the water management plan a acceptance of applications the director of public works or his or her designee shall monitor the water allocations established by resolution of the city council each proposed change in land use or project for which an application is submitted shall be evaluated to determine whether its approval could result in a net increase in water use for projects that will result in a net increase in water use the following procedure shall be used by the director of public works or his or her designee 1 the project shall first be classified into one or more land use categories based on the type of project for example a mixeduse project would be classified into both the commercial and multifamily residential categories 2 an estimate shall then be made of the net increase in water use that would result from the project within each land use category 3 if the project would require water from a land use category for which no allocation has been made the application shall be returned to the applicant and shall not be processed 4 if the project would require more water from a land use category than currently remains in that category after considering the original allocation minus all existing precommitments and dedications the application shall be returned to the applicant and shall not be processed or shall be denied 5 if the project requires water and there is sufficient supply remaining in the allocation for each category affected by the project to meet fully the anticipated demand the application may be accepted for processing after meeting all requirements for a complete application established by the city 6 upon acceptance of an application as complete by the planning director a precommitment of water resources shall be temporarily assigned by the director of public works or his or her designee to the project during the processing of the application the director of public works or his or her designee shall keep a single record of the remaining balance of water within each allocation category and a running total of all temporary precommitments and dedications to ensure that applications are not accepted for processing for which water would be unavailable upon approval for projects that are denied or abandoned the precommitment shall be terminated and the water shall be administratively restored to its original allocation category b approval of applications once an application for a project requiring water resources has received final approval the director of public works or his or her designee shall permanently reduce the remaining balance within each water allocation category affected by the project this action shall terminate the temporary precommitment of water resources and create a permanent dedication of water resources to the project subject to all applicable time limits established in the permit or by municipal code c abandonment of dedicated water resources upon making a determination that time limits applicable to a project have expired without implementation all water previously dedicated to a project but not used shall be considered abandoned all water abandoned or not used by such unimplemented projects shall be returned to the allocation category from which it originated and shall become available for use by subsequent projects for projects that are implemented and water demand was overestimated any remaining unused water shall be credited back to the citys unallocated reserve d treatment of approved and completed projects once a project has been approved and completed and commences to use city water it is no longer counted against that allocation category that projects water usage then becomes part of overall city water usage and the amount of water usage for the project will be reflected as part of the future years supplyusage balance as defined in for determining future water availability because the water usage portion of that calculation uses a fiveyear rolling average to smooth out yearly variability a new projects water usage will not be fully realized in the supplyusage calculation for five years this could result in the inadvertent assumption that there is more surplus water than is actually available in the first few years after the project is completed to account for the foregoing the following procedure will be enacted if the new project has an expected usage in excess of two acrefeet of city water per year an amount equal to the expected water usage for the project will be subtracted from any surplus water for a period of two years from the date when the project begins using city water no adjustment will be made if the citys water supplyusage balance is in deficit further allocations of surplus water to usage categories will be made after subtraction of all projects approved or completed within the past water year  part water use efficiency and new development purpose and scope  definitions  new development  residential remodeling  appeals  responsibility of customers

prior code  1215  findings a the city council finds and determines that 1 the city wastewater treatment plant is not capable of complying with the regulations and requirements of and is currently operating under a cease and desist order issued by the san francisco bay area regional water quality control board  2 fortyseven 47 additional residential housing units have been awarded project allocations under the project allocation system ordinance in prior years which have not yet been constructed  3 construction of the fortyseven 47 additional units already awarded project allocations will completely exhaust the wastewater treatment capacity of the citys wastewater treatment facilities unless additional capacity is added temporary and potentially hazardous means of raising the freeboard at the wastewater treatment plant  4 twelve 12 inches of freeboard is the maximum amount the freeboard can be raised at the citys wastewater treatment facility with provision for necessary emergency reserve conditions a twelve 12 inch increase in the freeboard would increase the capacity of the citys wastewater treatment facility sufficiently to allow service of approximately fiftyfive 55 additional connections provided that each connection does not exceed six hundred 600 gallons per day of wastewater discharge into the citys wastewater treatment facilities the six hundred 600 gallon per day measurement standard is the estimate by the city of the average daily usage of a typical fourbedroom singlefamily residence in the city  5 except for the areas designated as woodlands and water shed on the citys general plan map the use of discrete wastewater disposal systems for new residential housing units or for other uses allowed by the residential commercial and industrial zoning ordinances of the city rather than requiring connection to the citys wastewater treatment facilities would be contrary to the policies of the city and the regional water quality control board and would be contrary to the public health safety and welfare  6 the construction or establishment of each additional residential housing unit or other use allowed by the residential commercial and industrial zoning ordinances of the city which are served by the citys wastewater treatment facilities increases the violations by the citys facilities of the regulations requirements and cease and desist order of the regional water quality control board decreases the small amount of remaining capacity of the citys wastewater treatment facilities and if not carefully managed to allocate the remaining capacity fairly among the competing needs of the citizens and property owners of the city would be contrary to the public health safety and welfare  7 the city has no presently approved plan or project for either increasing the capacity of or improving the quality of treatment of the citys wastewater treatment facilities to comply with the regulations and requirements of the regional water quality control board and there is little probability that additional sewer treatment plant capacity will become available to the city prior to 1985  8 by adoption of the city did not intend to

which are very susceptible to wildland fires wildland fires are considered a significant threat in st helena native vegetation of brush woodland grassland and forest become extremely flammable during summer and remain so if drought conditions prevail during the winter months drought cycles appear in this area every seven to eleven 11 years b earthquake is considered to be one of the most potentially destructive threats to life and property in the city a moderate to severe seismic incident on any of the several fault zones in relative close proximity to st helena is expected to cause extensive property damage disruptions to communications systems and damage to public utility systems c st helena is divided geographically into two parts by the north to south flow of the napa river significant damaging flooding occurs in portions of the city approximately every five to ten 10 years warnings are usually given several hours to a few days before such floods this natural barrier can serve as a severe impediment to the delivery of public safety services in time of flood d several areas within the city offer poor access for the delivery of public safety services because of the

intermingled with steep hill terrain containing areas which are very susceptible to wildland fires wildland fires are considered a significant threat in st helena native vegetation of brush woodland grassland and forest becomes extremely flammable during summer and remains so if drought conditions prevail during the winter months drought cycles appear in this area every seven 11 years b earthquake is considered to be one of the most potentially destructive threats to life and property in the city a moderate to severe seismic incident on any of the several fault zones in relatively close proximity to st helena is expected to cause extensive property damage disruptions to communications systems and damage to public utility systems c st helena is divided geographically into two parts by the north to south flow of the napa river significant damaging flooding occurs in portions of the city approximately every five to ten 10 years warnings are usually given several hours to a few days before such floods this natural barrier can serve as a severe impediment to public safety services because of the severity of slopes and the existence of natural barriers such as the napa river sulphur creek and york creek d some areas of the forested hillside terrain that border the city have been designated as a woodlands and watershed area these are areas that are local

part  part  part prior code  5b21  editors note see definition of this term  variances a the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance b the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners c it is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this section are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate d generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation providing that the procedures of have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases e variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure f variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result g variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance h any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a city official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the napa county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land i the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued
