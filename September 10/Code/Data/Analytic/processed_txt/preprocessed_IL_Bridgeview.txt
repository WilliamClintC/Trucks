general industrial district 73 i2a intensive industrial district 70 purpose the industrial district regulations are intended to govern the location intensity and method of development of the industrial areas of bridgeview the regulations are designed to provide for the grouping together of industries that are compatible to one another and that are not objectionable to the community as a whole the regulations preserve lands for industrial and allied uses and prohibit the intrusion of residential and other noncompatible uses into the industrial area the performance of the industrial uses is regulated by establishing standards for the external effects of noise smoke vibration and other potential nuisances it is not the purpose or intent of the i2a zoning classification or the
