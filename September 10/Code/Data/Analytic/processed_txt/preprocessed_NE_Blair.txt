council with at least fortyfive 45 days notice except in extreme circumstances prior to the effective date of any action which would cause a loss or interruption in the continuity of multichannel service the purpose of the notice is to apprize the council of the possibility of such loss or interruption in the continuity of multichannel service so that is might explore its options and take appropriate measurers 4 whenever any situation occurs including those mentioned above which threatens the city and subscribers with the loss or interruption in the continuity of multi channel service then the council may direct the mcs provider for a period of up to twentyfour 24 months to de everything in its power to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous uninterrupted multichannel service of the same quality mix and levels regardless of the circumstances 5 during the interim period the council shall work with the mcs provider in order to secure a new multichannel system owner

underground franchise mcs providers duty to remove franchised properties from the public streets 1 this applicable to any mcs provider required to maintain a franchise to operate within the city 2 whenever the following occurs a a franchised mcs provider ceases to operate all or part of the multichannel system for a continuous period of six 6 months  b a franchised mcs provider ceases and fails to construct the multichannel system outlined in the application or proposal for renewal or renewal franchise agreement  c the council elects not to renew the franchise pursuant to the provisions set forth in the ordinance  d the franchised mcs providers franchise is revoked pursuant to the provisions set forth in this ordinance then unless the city or another mcs provider uses such multichannel

it with the proceeds of such sale going to the city 5 when such franchised mcs provider removes its multichannel system property from the street public ways and private property located within the city the franchisedmcs provider shall at its own expense and in a manner approved by the council replace and restore such public or private property in as good a condition as before the work causing the disturbance was done construction standards 1 methods of construction installation maintenance repair of any multichannel systems shall comply with the most current editions of the national electrical safety the national electric as affects the construction installation and maintenance of electrical supply and communication lines and attachments and supports to the extent that these are

for the multichannel system shall be detailed in the franchise agreement in a from and format determined by the council 3 a franchised mcs provider shall abide by the system construction schedule system expansion for mcs providers a franchised mcs provider shall extend multichannel service to any area within the city that has a density often 10 houses or building passings per mile or

installation except for the usual and normal connection fees paid by subscribers so long as the system expansion is technically feasible permits and licenses an mcs provider shall obtain at its own expense all permits and licenses required by law rule regulation or ordinance and maintain the same in full force and effect for as long as required councils policy with respect to safety requirements 1 the council requires thatthe mcs providers construction operation and maintenance of the multichannel system meet certain threshold safety levels which are designed to protect the public and lessen the likelihood of interruption of multichannel service 2 consequently the council may require may nonexempt mcs provider to adopt the following safety requirements a emergency alert override activation in the manner set forth in this ordinance  b minimum standby power as noted in this ordinance  c the provision of an indoor signal or safety alert technology in the manner noted in this ordinance  d implementing a periodic preventative maintenance program as set forth in this ordinance  e follow all fcc rules and regulations concerning maximum cumulative leakage index cli limits  and f comply with and abide by and construction safety or fire codes as noted in this ordinance provisions to alert subscribers in the event of an emergency  standby power 1 in order that subscribers may be alerted in the event of an impending imminent or actual natural or manmade emergency then all mcs providers shall ensure that the multichannel system providing multichannel service to all or part of the city is designed so as to permit an authorized official of the city to override the audio portion of all channels by tough tone phone or functional equivalent from any location 2 in addition to any other requirements listed in this an mcs provider shall a designate a channel which will be used for emergency broadcasts of both audio and video  b reasonably inform subscribers of the designated emergency channel  c maintain all channel video blanking capability to facilitate the needs of hearing and sightimpaired customers  d test the emergency override system not less than once a month  e cooperate with the city on the use and operation of the emergency alert override system  and f develop a plan with the citys concurrence in order to provide continuity ofmulti channel service and response to service calls in the event of a natural or man made emergency 3 as one method of providing continuity of multichannel services in the event of a natural or man made emergency an mcs provider shall unless exempted by the council have the capacity for four 4 hour automatically activated standby power on all trunk and feeder cable and all headbands hubs and receive sites associated with the distribution of cable service to and throughout the city safety alert technology 1 the council considers the need for an indoor signal or safety alert technology available to both subscribers and nonsubscribers of an mcs providers lowest level of programming service of paramount interest and need and as such should be an integral part of an mcs providers system though in some ways similar to the concept of emergency alert override signal alert technology is different and distinct in that it may be used by both subscribers to basic service and nonsubscribers to the basic service of an mcs providers system moreover such safety alert technology is connected to the national weather service twentyfour 24 hour radio service including its new wrsamesite select weather and warning system which specifically allows for an indoor warning and notification via an audio alert voice path regardless of whether an individual has a television receiver or monitor or an fm receiver and moreover can provide effectively instantaneous alert and warning as well as needed instructions in addition to allowing key connnunity oriented entities to connnunicate with both the general populace and selected segments of the connnunity 2 in realization and recognition of the preceding a nonexempt mcs provider shall offer for use throughout the city within twelve 12 months of the effective date of this ordinance a signal or safety alert monitoring technology for purposes of altering both subscribers and nonsubscribers of a multichannel system to impending or occurring disaster emergencies and allowing the city to connnunicate with subscribers and the public as the need to do so may exist at any time 3 anonexempt mcs provider shall cooperate with the city and the provider of said technology in the marketing and distribution of the necessary on premises alert receiving devices including the installation and replacement of such as maybe needed from time to time 4 a nonexempt mcs provider shall install the necessary electronics processing and distribution equipment in the mcs providers headend and will ensure the maintenance operating condition and replacement of such equipment as is necessary to protect its continued use 5 notwithstanding the preceding a nonexempt mcs provider has no responsibility for repair of such equipment beyond obtaining in a timely manner replacement from the manufacturer for inoperable components 6 it is explicitly understood that one need not be a subscriber to a multichannel system to use the safety alert device and receive the safety alert service so long as a drop is installed into the address to which said device is attached it is also understood that the user need not have a television receiver 7 the council recognizes the positive effect on the safety of the public in general and the ability to save lives and property of those who would otherwise be prevented from receiving the most expeditious warning or alert possible without such a device and technology consequently the council requires that all nonexempt mcs providers shall participate in a periodic public awareness campaign as deemed appropriate by the council in cooperation with the council and the manufacturer to inform the citizenry and noncable subscribers of the availability and capability of such safety alert technology 8 an mcs provider shall assure that all subscribers to multichannel service receive printed material fully describing the technology and its benefits at least annually and at the time of installation 9 an mcs provider shall allow nonsubscribers of basic cable service the choice of purchasing or leasing the necessary equipment which shall include the cost of installation on a nondiscriminatory basis and so inform such persons of both options 10 given the significant public safety and life and property saving benefits of this technology and the resultant need of as much of the general public as possible to be protected from the otherwise unnecessary greater risk to life limb and property associated with other alertwarning systems an mcs provider shall assure that the service is placed on the same level of service and is priced commensurate with that for like technologyservice in the midwestern united states 11 given the importance and critical nature of preventing the loss oflife and property and the need and ability of the council to communicate directly with the public in any number of situations including but not limited to those potentially involving matters of life and death and as this technology is clearly not a programming service the council deems it appropriate to designate the use of the capability of such technology as s governmental use of the system and it is the intent of the city that it be made available to all subscribers implementation of a preventative maintenance program 1 it shall be the duty of an mcs provider to devise and implement a quarterly preventative maintenance program for the multichannel system in order to ensure that there is no material degradation of the multichannel system that would effect the citizens health safety and welfare or negatively affect the quality of multichannel services being provided 2 before the mcs provider implements such a program it shall be reviewed and approved by the council within fortyfive 45 days after the completion of the quarterly preventative maintenance program the mcs provider shall prepare and submit a written report to the council detaining the results of the tests conducted and all items performed or addressed during the quarterly program although not exhaustive the following areas should be included in a preventative maintenance program and subsequent report a inspection and repair if needed of the headend  b inspection and repair if needed of the antenna tower  c requiring weather proofing and protection of the antenna lead connectors and on any other exposed fittings  d requiring the conducting of signal leakage tests that are in accord with fcc requirements  e removing tree roots limbs and branches that interfere with or come in contact with the mcs providers cable  f requiring the periodic servicing testing and calibration of the mcs providers equipment including equipment on service vehicles and field test equipment  g employing a status monitoring system to identify problems or situations in which the multichannel electronics are operating outside preprogrammed parameters  h testing of the emergency alert system to ensure that it will function property during an emergency situation  i testing of the safety alert system or technology construction fire and safety codes 1 an mcs provider shall construct operate maintain repair remove replace or restore the multichannel system in strict compliance with all current technical codes adopted by the council the state or the united states 2 the codes referred to specifically include but are not limited to construction fire and safety and zoning codes alternative user charge 1 this applicable to any unfranchised but otherwise authorized mcs provider and to any mcs provider who has had its franchise ruled unconstitutional unenforceable or invalid for all franchised mcs providers the provisions concerning franchise fees shall be applicable 2 where not specifically prohibited by federal or state law and as an alternative to the imposition of a franchise fee as set forth in this ordinance the council may impose extract and collect a charge from an affected mcs provider for the use by such provider of the streets rightsofway easements and public ways of the city 3 the alternative user charge shall be based on the following mathematical mode a determine the present value of all public streets rightsofway easements and public ways of the city in which are located multichannel system facilities and equipment of the affected mcs provider  b take the average percentage increase in land appraisals within the city as determined by the washington county assessor for the city for the five preceding years  c take the average percentage increase for the five preceding years and use it to determine the dollar amount of property value increase for the remaining term ofthe franchise if no franchise applicable then use five years  d add the present value to the dollar amount of property value increase for the remaining term of the franchise if no franchise applicable then use 5 years  e divide the adjusted value by the remaining number of years on the term of the franchise if no franchise applicable then use 5 years  f multiply that figure by five percent 5% to arrive at the annual user charge that is to be collected from the affected mcs provider for purposes of illustration only the formula reads as follows present value the dollar amount of the property value increase for remaining term of the franchise based on average percentage increase ofland appraisals for past years of franchise term  divide the adjusted present value by the remaining years on the term of the franchise  multiply that figure by five percent 5% equals the annual alternative user charge 4 the council adopts such an alternative user charge in order to receive fair compensation for the affected mcs providers use of the public streets and public ways if such compensation cannot be obtained by imposing a flat percentage fee on such mc providers annual gross revenues however an affected mcs provider may agree to an alternative charge that is based on a flat percentage of gross revenue as long as that charge did not exceed the maximum amount previously allowed under law that was assessed as a franchise fee calculated as a percentage of an affected mcs providers annual gross revenues 5 it is expressly understood that a franchise fee and an alternative user charge will not be imposed on the same mcs provider at the same time for the same period 6 an affected mcs provider shall at no time be charged or obligated to pay an alternative user charge that exceeds the maximum amount previously allowed under law that was assessed as a franchise fee calculated as a percentage of such mcs providers gross revenues as defined by this ordinance for any particular reporting period in the event that the alternative user charge does exceed the maximum amount previously allowed under law that was assessed as a franchise fee and calculated as a percentage of gross revenues then such alternative user charge should be reduced to reflect an amount not greater than the maximum amount previously allowed under law that was assessed as a franchise fee and calculated as a percentage of gross revenues 7 an affected mcs provider shall pay twentyfive percent 25% of the alternative user charge at the end of every three 3 months franchise required  exception 1 except as provided in this no person or mcs provider shall be permitted to construct operate or maintain a multichannel system which requires the laying or positioning of cable coaxial fiber or functional equivalent across the rightsofways of the city without having first obtained a franchise and then entering into a franchise agreement with the city 2 pursuant to the ccpa a local government may own and operate a multichannel system classified as a cable system consequently should the council directly or indirectly legal means available to the council decide to purchase acquire construct lease control or otherwise own a cable system within the territorial limits of the city then the council shall not be required to submit a proposal for a receive a franchise in order to construct operate and maintain a cable system within the geographical limits of the city 3 in the case of a person or mcs provider lawfully providing multichannel service without a franchise on  then such person or mcs provider shall not be required to obtain a franchise and enter into a franchise agreement unless the council expressly required the person or mcs provider to do so 4 if as a result of annexation either previous to or subsequent to the effect date of this ordinance an mcs provider comes under the jurisdiction of the city then such mcs provider shall be subject to the provisions of this ordinance including if applicable obtaining a franchise any such franchise shall extend only to the territory comprising the annexed area 5 where a person or mcs provider is required by the council to obtain a franchise then the council shall notify the person or mcs provider in writing within thirty 30 days of the councils formal action 6 after receipt of notification the affected person or mcs provider has ninety 90 days to submit an application or proposal in substantially the same form and format as required by the council then the affected person or mcs providers application will be handled as set forth by either state or local law authority to grant nonexclusive franchises 1 consistent with 47 usc 541 the council may award one 1 or more nonexclusive multichannel service franchises within its geographical limits with the exception of existing nonexempt mcs providers in an area annexed by the city and subject to of this ordinance the council shall not award a franchise for a service area comprising less than the entire city limits existing nonexempt mcs providers as of the effective date of this ordinance may but are not limited to serve any subsequently annexed area of the city in a manner consistent with line extension policies outlined in this ordinance and which are specifically noted in the mcs providers franchised agreement further any mcs provider not exempt on the effective date of this ordinance may not commence service to subscribers until it has completed construction of its cable system to fifty percent 50% of the service area the provisions of of this ordinance do not apply to this subsection 2 a franchised mcs provider shall be selected as part of a public proceeding and hearing which affords due process to both the city and the applicant and after which if the applicant is selected as a franchised mcs provider then such applicant will enter into a franchise agreement with the city pursuant to the provisions offederal state and local laws and regulations franchise agreement  minimal requirements 1 ifthe council awards an applicant a franchise to construct

or consumption of alcohol is involved 3 improper conduct involving sexual acts occurs at sexually oriented businesses which provide private or semiprivate booths or viewing rooms for the viewing of films videos or live performances 4 the findings noted above raise substantial governmental concerns for the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city of blair and it is appropriate for

concerns and promote and protect the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city of blair 6 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of reasonable

hazard areas of blair nebraska  are subject to inundation which results in loss oflife and property  health  and safety hazards  disrnption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health  safety and general welfare  2 general causes of these flood losses  these flood losses are caused by  1 the cumulative effect of obstmction in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities  2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately or otherwise protected from flood damages  3 methods used to analyze flood hazards  this a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series ofinterrelated steps a selection of a base flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated  and the depth of inundation  the base flood selected for this ordinance is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance  it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent 1% chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the flood insurance study and illustrative materials dated   as amended  b calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood  c computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than 1 foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstmction is permitted which would cause any water surface increase along the floodway profile  e delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood  1002 15 statement of purpose  it is the purpose of this promote the public health  safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses
