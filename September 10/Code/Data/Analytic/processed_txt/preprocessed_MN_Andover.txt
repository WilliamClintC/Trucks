accordance with any floodplain regulations applicable to the site where these controls do not exist the elevation to which the lowest floor including basement is placed or floodproofed must be determined as follows 1 for lakes by placing the lowest floor at a level at least three feet 3 above the highest known water level or three feet 3 above the ordinary high water level whichever is higher   2 for rivers and streams by placing the lowest floor at least three feet 3 above the flood of record if data is available  if data is not available by placing the lowest floor at least three feet 3 above the ordinary high water level or by conducting a technical evaluation to determine effects of proposed construction upon flood stages and flood flows and to establish a flood protection elevation under all three 3 approaches technical evaluations must be done by a qualified engineer or hydrologist consistent with minnesota statutes minnesota regulations parts  to  governing the management of floodplain areas if more than one approach is used the highest flood protection elevation determined must be used for placing structures and other facilities  and   amd 2003  3 water
