those listed the director of public works or his or her designee shall have the discretion to grant such petition for good cause residential users who move to a new residence shall have the use from their previous residence assigned to them the average monthly winter use measured in hundreds of cubic feet shall be multiplied by the rate set by the common council pursuant to subsection a of this

increases beyond the 12 acre the technical justifications required for issuing the variance increase bvariances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a

historic character and design of the structure cvariances shall not be issued within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result dvariances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary deviation from the requirements of this chapter evariances shall only be issued upon ia showing of good
