recycling 2361 legislative findings the city council finds amaximizing the recycling economy in the city and throughout the country will create and sustain additional wellpaying jobs stimulate the economy save energy and conserve valuable natural resources  brecycling is an important action that people can take to be environmental stewards  cmunicipal recycling rates in the united states steadily increased from 66% in 1970 to 286% in 200 but since 2000 the rate of increase has slowed considerably  da decline in manufacturing has reduced both the supply of and demand for recycling materials  erecycling allows the recovery of critical materials necessary to sustain the recycling economy and protect national interests  fin 201 the united states recycling industry collected processed and consumed over 130000000 metric tons of recyclable material valued at $77000000000  grecycling saves energy by decreasing the amount of energy needed to manufacture the products that people build buy and use  hmany manufacturers use recycled commodities to make products saving energy and reducing the need for raw materials  iusing recycled materials in place of raw materials can result in energy savings of 92% for aluminum cans 87% for mixed plastics 63% for steel cans 45% for recycled newspaper and 34% for recycled glass  jmany city residents already utilize the citys recycling centers and many have expressed interest in utilizing a curbside recycling program if one were offered and available  kvarious waste hauling entities are also engaged in the recycling business and will provide curbside recycling for city residents and businesses if the economies of scale justify such a program  lan exclusive license to provide a curbside recycling program in the

streets and rightsofway thereby minimizing roadway wear and tear  nthe city already provides similar exclusivity to a towing contractor and a waste hauler to provide public towing services and public waste pickup services throughout the city  otherefore the city council finds that it is in the best interests of the city its residents its businesses and its guests to authorize an exclusive license

securing the information necessary to determine whether the cultivation distribution and use of marijuana are being conducted lawfully and whether all codes and regulations associated with such activities are being followed accordingly the registration of a particular location as the site of cultivation which need not undermine the privacy and confidentiality of the patientcaregiver relationship could be critical to law enforcement and city officials in order to identify and distinguish sites of lawful activity from sites of unlawful and potentially hazardous activity 2the experience in the state of california a state that approved the medical use of marijuana in 199 is that concentrations of marijuana distribution activity lead to serious secondary effects including resales of medical marijuana sharing of justpurchased marijuana street dealers lurking in neighborhoods to offer a lower price for marijuana to arriving patients marijuana smoking in public and in

purpose and findings athe purpose of this article is to protect the public health safety and welfare of the property and persons in the city by prohibiting persons under 18 years of age from possessing tobacco products and vapor products and prohibiting the sale of tobacco products and vapor products to persons under 18 years of age bpersons under age 18 are prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing cigarettes and other tobacco products and retailers are prohibited from selling them to minors however tobaccoless products  commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes ecigarettes ecigars ecigarillos epipes ehookahs or electronic nicotine delivery systems  allow the user to simulate cigarette smoking and ingest nicotine these products may be purchased by minors and are being marketed without age restrictions or health warnings and come in different flavors that appeal to young people cstudies by the fda have determined that ecigarettes can increase nicotine addiction among young people and contain chemical ingredients known to be harmful which may expose users and the public to potential health risks the use of ecigarettes and similar devices has increased significantly in recent years as evidenced by the fact that 1between 2011 and 2012 the percentage of all youth in grades 6 to 12 who had tried electronic smoking devices doubled  268% of all youth between 6th and 12th grade report trying electronic smoking devices  310% of high school students have tried electronic smoking devices  493% of youth who have used electronic smoking devices have never smoked conventional cigarettes  and 5between 2010 and 201 rates of both awareness and use of unregulated electronic smoking devices by adults also increased significantly 6the 2014 survey conducted by monitoring the future released on  by the national institute on drug abuse revealed recent use by 87% of eighth graders 162% of tenth graders and 171% of twelfth graders dexisting studies on electronic smoking devices vapor emissions and cartridge contents have found a number of dangerous substances including 1chemicals known to cause cancer such as formaldehyde acetaldehyde lead nickel and chromium  2pm25 acrolein tin toluene and aluminum which are associated with a range of negative health effects such as skin eye and respiratory irritation neurological effects damage to reproductive systems and even premature death from heart attacks and stroke  3inconsistent labeling of nicotine levels in electronic smoking device products  and 4in one instance diethylene glycol an ingredient used in antifreeze and toxic to humans esome cartridges used by electronic smoking devices can be refilled with liquid nicotine solution creating the potential for exposure to dangerous concentrations of nicotine and as a result 1in one instance diethylene glycol an ingredient used in antifreeze and toxic to humans 2poisonings from electronic smoking devices have increased dramatically in the last three and half years from one a month in september 2010 to 215 a month in february 2014 3analysis of reports of poisonings from electronic smoking devices finds that calls reporting exposure to electronic smoking devices are much more likely to involve adverse health effects when compared to calls reporting exposure to conventional cigarettes fclinical studies about the safety and efficacy of these products have not been submitted to the fda for the over 400 brands of electronic smoking devices that are on the market and for this reason consumers currently have no way of knowing 1whether electronic smoking devices are safe  2what types or concentrations of potentially harmful chemicals the products contain  and 3what dose of nicotine the products deliver gthe world health organization has strongly advised consumers against the use of electronic smoking devices until they are deemed safe and effective and of acceptable quality by a competent national regulatory body hthe world medical association has determined that electronic smoking devices are not comparable to scientificallyproven methods of smoking cessation and that neither their value as therapeutic aids for smoking cessation nor their safety as cigarette replacements is established iin september of 201 40 state attorneys general including michigans signed a letter to the commissioner of the united states food and drug administration outlining their concerns with ecigarettes and requesting the implementation of regulations that would address the advertising ingredients and sale to minors of ecigarettes at the federal level jit is the intent of the city council in enacting this article to provide for the public health safety and welfare by facilitating uniform and consistent enforcement of smokefree air laws  by reducing the potential for renormalizing smoking in public places and places of employment  by reducing the potential for children to associate the use of electronic smoking devices with a normative or healthy lifestyle  and by prohibiting the sale or distribution of electronic smoking devices to minors ktherefore the city council determines that prohibiting the sale giving or furnishing of ecigarettes to minors and prohibiting the purchase possession or use of ecigarettes by minors is in the citys best interests and will promote the public health safety and welfare for purposes of this article the city is adopting the term vapor product to address ecigarettes and all similar devices because this term has been defined by the michigan house and senate in senate bills 667 and 668 enrolled in june of 201 as part of proposed amendments to the youth tobacco act being public act 31 of 1915  21715 3593 definitions for the purpose of

these values and avoid the concentration of uses which would have a detrimental effect on either property values or the overall character of the city the purpose of this ordinance as it relates to adult entertainment uses is therefore to control blight and to maintain or increase economic vitality and not to restrict the freedom of speech or to restrict access to alternative forms of entertainment it is a wellestablished fact that a concentration of adult entertainment uses including adult bookstores adult video stores adult motion picture theaters and similar uses can lead to urban blight it is therefore the intent of the provisions relating to adult entertainment uses to minimize this impact by avoiding the concentration of such uses in close proximity to one another or to residential zoning districts it is recognized that adult entertainment uses are not dependent upon the surrounding neighborhood for their market in fact they can be classified as comparison shopping facilities whose market extends far beyond the adjacent neighborhood restricting the uses to the c2 planned comparison district recognizes this market impact it is further noted that the impact of adult entertainment uses on nearby residential areas is increased by the location of such uses in freestanding commercial structures restricting the location of adult entertainment uses to planned shopping centers helps minimize this impact by deemphasizing their visibility and their impact on the nearby residential neighborhood furthermore any negative impacts associated with such a use would be restricted primarily to surrounding commercial tenants the overall community impact of such a use would therefore be reduced by this requirement for the reasons stated above adult

zoning and project review for the development of high intensity multipurpose centers in planned locations which will serve as focal points within the total urban design of the city while providing stability and longevity for the economic development of the city of sterling heights the importance and impact of said centers require that their location be limited and that the plans for their development be given extensive review as to the effect on the total community this district is designed as an optional form of development to encourage innovation and variety in the design and arrangement of highly concentrated integrated and diversified functions within a given development area while ensuring comprehensive development plan and review process an integrated compatibility between its own elements and compatibility with adjacent forms of development due to the magnitude and arrangement of development in a planned center district it is anticipated that division of the property may become necessary in order to facilitate this division compliance with the subdivision regulations of the city of sterling heights and the subdivision control act of 196 as amended is encouraged at the preliminary planning stages the development of a planned center district shall be permitted only upon property which was zoned o3 c2 m1 or m2 immediately preceding its

accent repeating some types creates unity but no types should be overused variety should be achieved with respect to seasonable changes species selected texture color and size at maturity  blandscaping should be encouraged that will serve the functions of enhancing the visual environment ensuring public safety moderating the microclimate and minimizing nuisances  clandscaping should serve to integrate the project with the site with a particular sensitivity to the natural topography and existing native vegetation it should enhance the architecture of surrounding structures when possible by being of similar scale  dpreservation of the existing landscape materials and landforms is usually desirable particularly where mature trees are a part of the site  evisual variety should be the aim of landscaping treatment landscaping should be used to break up large expanses of pavement  flocal soil water and other climatic conditions should be considered when choosing landscape materials to create optimum conditions for their survival and to ensure that they will thrive with a minimum amount of maintenance  glandscaping should be protected from vehicular and pedestrian encroachment raised planting surfaces and the use of curbs are ways of achieving this objective  hspecies that are a public nuisance or that cause litter should be avoided when landscaping is to be

repel visitors affect the visual quality enjoyed daily by residents affect the safety of vehicular travel and pedestrians and define the character of the community 4aesthetic considerations impact economic values as well as public health safety and welfare 5signs also take up space and may obstruct views distract motorists displace alternative uses for land and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation 6the unregulated installation and display of signs constitutes a public nuisance detrimental to the public health safety convenience and general welfare 7therefore the purpose of this section is to establish reasonable regulations pertaining to the time place and manner in which outdoor signs and window signs may be installed and maintained in order to achieve the following purposes apromotion of the general health safety and welfare including the creation of an attractive and harmonious environment  bmaintenance and enhancement of the visual quality aesthetics

distracted not only by a changing message but also by knowing that the sign has a changing message and waiting for the next change to occur despite these public safety concerns however there is also merit in allowing new technologies to easily update signage messages to minimize the proliferation of signage by allowing multiple messages on a single sign and to facilitate expression with messages that are easily discernible so long as restrictions are in place to minimize the potential for driver distraction and to minimize negative impact to residential districts where signs can adversely impact the residential character of the area therefore the following regulations shall apply to electronic message board signage 1display only static messages andor images that remain constant in

as agricultural bbillboards 1billboards are freestanding offpremises signs 2the city council has determined that signs and billboards located on premises to which they do not specifically relate and which are designed to capture the attention of motorists and others utilizing public ways create a danger to public safety by distracting the attention of drivers from the roadway who in some instances may focus on the message being conveyed the anticipated message to follow andor other function of a billboard visible while operating a motor vehicle a number of national and international studies during the period 2013 to 2016 have observed that driving irrelevant material may make it difficult to extract information that is necessary for safe driving  advertising signs affect driver attention to the extent that road safety is compromised  clear evidence of impaired driving performance became evident as drivers passed billboards at higher speeds  and drivers glance more at the time of a switch to a new message display than when a billboard is simply visible and stable 3further the united states supreme court has recognized that it is not speculative to recognize that billboards by their very nature wherever located and however constructed can be perceived as an aesthetic harm an unmarred landscape promotes tourism and levels the playing field between local businesses and national chains 4several states have completely banned billboards and at least two other states have banned the construction of any new billboards 5therefore because billboards are only
