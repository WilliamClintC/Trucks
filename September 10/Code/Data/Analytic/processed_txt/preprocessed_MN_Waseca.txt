runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs the radius of each arc is 10000 feet for all runways 3conical zone all that land which lies directly under an imaginary conical surface extending upward and outward for the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 to 1 for a horizontal distance of 4000 feet 4approach zone all that land which lies directly under an

documents are incorporated by reference under part  items a and b the local government unit may seek the advice of the technical evaluation panel as to the wetland size and type wetlands exceptional quality exceptional quality wetlands contain an abundance of different plant species with dominance evenly spread among several species such wetlands may support some rare or unusual plant species invasive or exotic plant species are either absent or limited to small areas where some disturbance has occurred this higher level of plant species variety generally provides high wildlife habitat value and may also support rare wildlife species the shorelines of exceptional quality wetlands are natural and unaffected by erosion these wetlands exhibit no evidence of significant man induced water level fluctuation exceptional quality wetlands provide excellent water quality protection high aesthetic quality and provide excellent opportunities for educational and scientific activities within the community wetlands high quality high quality wetlands are still generally in their natural state and tend to show less evidence of adverse effects of surrounding land uses exotic and invasive plant species may be present and species dominance may not be evenly distributed among several species however a minimum of 20 different species can be found within the basin there tends to be little evidence of water level fluctuation due to storms and their shorelines are stable with little evidence of erosion the combination of these factors result in these wetlands being judged as providing a greater level of water quality protection and significantly better wildlife habitat they show little if any evidence of human influences and their greater levels of species variety wildlife habitat and ecological stability results in higher aesthetic quality these characteristics also offer opportunities for educational or scientific value to the community wetlands low quality wetlands included in this category have been substantially altered by agricultural or urban development that caused overnutrification soil erosion sedimentation and water quality degradation as a result of these factors these wetlands exhibit low levels of plant species and a related reduction in the quality of wildlife habitat these wetlands may also tend to exhibit extreme water level fluctuations in response to storms and show evidence of shoreline erosion while these wetlands do provide for water quality and serve an important role in protecting water quality downstream the combination of these characteristics cause these wetlands to provide low levels of water quality protection and to have poor aesthetic quality they often exhibit evidence of significant human influences and they are deemed to be of little educational or scientific value to the community wetlands medium quality medium quality wetlands have a slightly higher number of plant species present than low quality wetlands often with small pockets of indigenous species within larger areas dominated by invasive or exotic species their relatively greater species variety results in slightly better wildlife habitat they exhibit evidence of relatively less fluctuation in water level in response to storms and less evidence of shoreline erosion as a result of these characteristics these wetlands provide somewhat better water quality protection they also exhibit relatively less evidence of human influences and therefore tend to be of a higher aesthetic quality these wetlands are still judged to be of limited educational or scientific value to the community wholesale sales business primarily engaged in selling merchandise to retailers  to industrial commercial institutional or professional
