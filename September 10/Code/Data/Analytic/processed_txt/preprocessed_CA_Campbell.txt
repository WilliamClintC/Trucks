beginning with supplement no 12 municipal will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation during original codification the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of book publishing company under the direction of robert dempster city attorney the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement

with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the

the projection of the footing beyond the face of the supported member does not exceed the footing thickness exception in detached one and twofamily dwelling three stories or less in height the projection of the footing beyond the face of the supported member is permitted to exceed the footing thickness b plain concrete footing supporting walls are permitted provided the footings have at

performance of plain and underreinforced concrete footing observed in the 1994 northridge earthquake d concrete construction shall be modified to read 17053 concrete construction the special

2500 pounds per square inch psi 172 mpa rationale results from studies after the 1994 northridge earthquake indicated that a lot of the damages were attributed to lack of quality control during construction the proposed amendment improves quality control during construction and therefore needs to be incorporated into the cbc exception no1 to allow special inspection not to be required for isolated spread footing where the structural design of the footing is based on a specified compressive strength fc no greater than 2500 psi this proposed amendment is a continuation of an amendment

12122016 inclusionary housing ordinance   findings the city council finds that a housing prices and rents in the city of campbell have increased at a significantly higher rate than general wages the lack of affordable housing in campbell forces many residents to pay a very high percentage of their income for housing or to commute considerable distances adding to air pollution and traffic congestion in campbell and throughout santa clara county the lack of affordable housing has made it more difficult to recruit workers from out of the area in general especially workers in lowerpaying jobs potentially affecting the economic vitality of the campbell new housing developments do not to any appreciable extent provide housing affordable to low and moderateincome households b continued new housing developments which do not include housing for low and moderateincome households will serve to further aggravate the current shortage of affordable housing by reducing the small remaining supply of undeveloped land c the city council approved the citys housing element of the general plan which includes a goal to encourage the provision of housing affordable to a variety of household income levels goal h31 housing development  policy h32a citywide inclusionary housing  d implementation of the inclusionary ordinance is a necessary part of the citys efforts to meet its general plan housing element goals and objectives and its region wide affordable housing obligations through the inclusionary ordinance at least fifteen percent of the units in a new housing development of ten or more units will be price or rent restricted as units for low and moderateincome households in some circumstances developers will be offered an option of providing affordable units offsite or payment of an inlieu housing fee att 3 part 2006   purpose of chapter the purpose of this chapter is to further the citys efforts to require housing available to very lowincome lowincome and moderateincome households the citys general plan implements the established policy of the state of california that each community should foster an adequate supply of housing for persons at all economic levels providing the affordable units required by this chapter will help to ensure that part of campbells remaining developable land is used to provide affordable housing an economically balanced community is only possible if part of the new housing built in the city is affordable to households with limited incomes requiring builders of new housing to include some housing affordable to households at a range of incomes is fair not only because new development without affordable units contributes to the shortage of affordable housing but also because zoning and other ordinances concerning new housing should be consistent with the communitys goal to foster an adequate supply of housing for persons at all economic levels in general affordable units within each housing development will serve the goal of maintaining an economically balanced community the inclusionary housing ordinance is required by the council to promote and protect the public health safety and general welfare while preserving and

cabinets associated with the structure  or f the proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the area in proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground 3 in addition for all towers and base stations wherever located a substantial change occurs when a the proposed collocation or modification would defeat the existing concealment elements of the support structure as determined by the community development director  or b the proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of approval provided however that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval related to height width equipment cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a substantial change described in this section 4 interpretation of thresholds a the thresholds for a substantial change described above are disjunctive the failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds means that a substantial change would occur b the thresholds for height increases are cumulative limits for sites with horizontally separated deployments the cumulative limit is measured from the
