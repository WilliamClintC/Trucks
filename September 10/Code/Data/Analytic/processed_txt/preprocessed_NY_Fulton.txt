62431 existing backflow prevention devices any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the department to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health where the degree of hazard has increased as in the case of residential installation converting to

lowhazard backflow prevention devices shall be inspected and tested annually b any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will be repaired or replaced when repairs are necessary upon completion of the repair the device will be retested at the owners expense to ensure correct operation highhazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately in other situations a compliance date of not more than 30 days after the test date will be established the owner is responsible for spare parts repair tools

when the owner desires such continuity c backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than specified in above in cases where there is a history of test failures and the department feels that due to the degree of hazard involved additional testing is warranted cost of the additional tests will be borne by the owner  62432 fulton code  62433 c668 zoning general references planning
