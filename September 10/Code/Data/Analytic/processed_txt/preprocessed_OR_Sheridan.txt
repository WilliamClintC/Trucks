the sheridan municipal originally published by book publishing company has been kept current by regular supplementation by matthew bender & company inc its successor in interest beginning with supplement no 6 municipal will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation during original codification the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of book publishing company under the direction of mike sauerwein city manager and walt gowell city attorney the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 6 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a subjectmatter index with complete crossreferencing locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers this supplement brings the to date no 201901 passed  municipal capital circle sw tallahassee fl 32310 8002622633 how to use your code this code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials city employees and private citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by number section if applicable and year example  1992 beginning with

manager shall decide requests for variances from the requirements of the flood plain overlay district consistent with the type i process generally the only situation under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level in conformance with the criteria in lots greater than onehalf acre the technical justification required for approving the variance increases b prior to or after the application has been submitted the city manager or designee shall notify the applicant in writing that 1 the granting of a variance to construct a structure with the elevation of the lowest floor less than one foot above the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance commensurate with the increased rick resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation  and 2 such construction less than one foot above the base flood elevation increases risk to life and property such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions as required in subsection c c the city manager or designee shall 1 maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance  and 2 report variances granted to the federal insurance administration upon request d variances may be issued for the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or the statewide

conditions or denied as deemed necessary to implement the flood plain overlay district  12192011   4182016   3202017   variance criteria in deciding variance applications the decision authority shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other relevant sections of the zoning and development ordinance and the following factors a there is a good and sufficient cause  b failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  c granting the variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws  d the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief  e the variance will be consistent with the intent and purpose of the provision being varied  f there has not been a previous land use action approved on the basis that variances would not be allowed  g the new construction or substantial improvement is not within any designated regulatory floodway or if located in a floodway no increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge will result  h the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  i the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  j the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  k the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  l the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  m the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  n the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  o the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan the underlying zone for the subject property and the flood plain overlay district for that area  p the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  q the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  r the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges  s variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare  and t variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dryfloodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria except otherwise complies with anchoring g construction materials and methods and h utilities  12192011   4182016   3202017   warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by the flood plain overlay district is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations
