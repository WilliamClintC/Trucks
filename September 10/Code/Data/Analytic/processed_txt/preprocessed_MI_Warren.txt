of the citizens of this city from the threat posed by the availability of synthetic marihuana and other dangerous products by prohibiting persons from trafficking in possessing and using them in the city b findings 1 the city finds that synthetic marihuana consisting of plant or other material treated with chemicals or other substances that have not been approved for human consumption by the fda is being marketed and sold as herbal incense potpourri or other uses unrelated to inhalation or ingestion and is being used in the same manner and for the same purposes as marihuana with that use having become increasingly popular particularly among teens and young adults 2 the city further finds based on information and reports from health centers hospitals doctors and police agencies that individuals who use synthetic marihuana experience dangerous side effects including convulsions tremors seizures hallucinations unconsciousness anxiety attacks dangerously elevated heart rates increased blood pressure vomiting and disorientation evidencing that these herbal incense products are harmful if consumed and present an imminent and significant public health danger to persons consuming such products and other persons coming in contact with them 3 the city further finds that notwithstanding the high potential for abuse and lack of any accepted medical use the ability of the state to prohibit all forms of synthetic marihuana as a controlled substance has been frustrated due to the changing nature of the chemicals used in the manufacturing process 4 the city further finds that in addition to synthetic marihuana there may be other dangerous products or materials containing chemicals or substances that while not approved for human consumption are or may be marketed and sold in a form that allows for such consumption and which upon consumption may result in the same serious side effects and public health dangers as synthetic marihuana  61212 definitions as used in

planned unit development district division 1  purpose intent and qualification general purpose because traditional zoning separates uses into different districts using restrictive placement controls it does not allow for creative development incorporating a variety of uses the purpose of the planned unit development district is to encourage development of those parcels of land which because of their size  their location being uniquely situated with regard to adjoining uses  or their unique environmental features a more flexible development scheme could foster creative development design or preserve desirable natural features or significant historical landmarks and architectural features located within the planned unit development district therefore the planned unit development pud district modifies the traditional form of zoning and permits variety in design site configuration layout and use minimizes paved surfaces encourages efficiency in use of land and natural resources while ensuring compatibility with surrounding land uses  112304 general intent the adoption of a planned unit development pud district is intended to encourage creativity unified development of a larger tract of property utilizing mixed residential and commercial uses that provide adequate housing and employment opportunities it is the intent of this article to allow rezoning of qualifying properties to planned unit development pud district pursuant to mcl b thereby establishing a site specific use authorization  112304 intent of requiring development agreement it is recognized that because of the complexity and uniqueness of each parcel or tract of land proposed for planned unit development rezoning it is beneficial to the city and the development process if a development agreement which includes all site plans development standards and specified conditions tailored to the particular parcel of property are submitted together with the application for rezoning this approach is intended to accomplish the objectives of the zoning ordinance by incorporating a land development project review process into the rezoning procedure to ensure integration of the proposed land development project with the characteristics of the surrounding area  112304 eligibility for pud rezoning  qualifying conditions to be eligible for pud district rezoning as provided by this article all of the following conditions must exist with regard to the proposed pud site a rezoning to pud district shall not be granted in situations where the same land use objectives may be established by the application of applicable conventional zoning provisions or standards b the land proposed to be included within the pud district must consist of sufficient acreage as recommended by the planning commission to meet the objectives of this ordinance c the land proposed to be included in the pud district shall have features the preservation of which will be enhanced as a pud  or is uniquely situated with regard to adjoining uses which would permit variety in design site configuration layout and use  or has unique historical or environmental features or other characteristics
