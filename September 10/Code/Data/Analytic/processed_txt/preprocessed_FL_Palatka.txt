within the city they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients blight neighborhoods adversely affect neighboring businesses lower real property values promote crime particularly the kinds detailed in subsection 5 and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations 7 the establishments in which the activities described in subsections 1 2 and 3 occur are usually constructed in part or in whole of substandard materials and are usually maintained in a manner reflecting disregard for the health and safety of the occupants and have exterior appearance andor signage that depreciates the value of adjoining real property and otherwise contributes to urban decline 8 the activities described in subsections 1 2 and 3 frequently occur in establishments concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages 9 the concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections 1 2 and 3 leads to an increase in criminal activity moral degradation and disturbances of the peace and order of the city 10 the concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections 1 2 and 3 is hazardous to the health and safety of those persons in attendance depreciates the value of adjoining real property harms the economic welfare of the city and adversely affects the publics interest in the quality of life tone of commerce and community environment in the city 11 in order to preserve and safeguard the health safety morals and general welfare of the people of the city it is necessary and advisable for the city to prohibit the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages at establishments where the activities described in subsections 1 2 and 3 occur 12 workers of establishments at which the activities described in subsections 1 2 and 3 engage in a higher incidence of certain types of criminal behavior than workers of other establishments including prostitution and lewdness in violation of fs ch 796 operating without an occupational license and operating unlicensed massage parlors and cosmetology businesses 13 physical contact within establishments at which the activities described in subsections 1 2 and 3 occur between workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and sexually transmissible diseases 14 in order to preserve and safeguard the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizenry of the city it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners managers operators agents workers entertainers performers and customers at establishments where the activities described in subsections 1 2 and 3 occur 15 the potential dangers to the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizenry of the city posed by permitting an establishment at which the activities described in subsections 1 2 and 3 occur to operate without first obtaining a license under this chapter are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate a thorough but prompt investigation and review of a license application will facilitate this public purpose suspension or revocation of adult entertainment licenses at which repeated specified criminal acts as defined in section 36 are allowed to occur upon adequate proof at administrative proceedings of the occurrence of such acts will serve to protect the community from such danger by deterring or ending the use of the establishment for future specified criminal acts access to prompt judicial review by the circuit court of administrative suspension and revocation proceedings will protect the rights of the licensee 16 requiring licensees of establishments at which the activities described in subsections 1 2 and 3 occur to keep a list of information concerning current workers and certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 17 prohibiting establishments at which the activities described in subsections 1 2 and 3 occur from operating within set distances of educational institutions religious institutions areas zoned for residential use and parks at which minors are customarily found will serve to protect minors from the adverse effects of the activities that accompany such establishments 18 straddle dancing and lewd and lascivious touching between customers and workers or performers does not contain any element of communication and is therefore conduct rather than expression 19 straddle dancing prostitution sexual activity and lewd and lascivious touching between customers and workers or performers in adult entertainment establishments poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes or actually causes the spread of communicable and sexually transmitted diseases 20 the practice of not paying workers at sexually oriented businesses and requiring them to earn their entire income from tips or gratuities from customers who are predisposed to desire or want sexual activity has resulted in a high incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness 21 sexually oriented businesses involve activities that are pure conduct engaged in and for the purpose of making a profit rather than speech or expressive activity and therefore are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health welfare and safety of the community 22 requiring sexually oriented businesses to post a listing of services provided and restrict services to those listed as well as to maintain worker records will discourage incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution thereby further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and assisting in the facilitation of the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal acts occur 23 close personal or physical contact between customers and performers at adult entertainment establishments who are displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas facilitates and encourages the exchange of money for prostitution lewd touching and other illegal activity which poses a danger to the community and the participants 24 requiring performers at adult entertainment establishments who are displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas to remain on stage and at least three feet away from customers who are in the establishment will serve to protect the public by discouraging and making more difficult direct physical contact which results in incidents of criminal behavior such as prostitution and unlawful lewd or lascivious touching between performers and customers 25 operators or workers of adult entertainment establishments who have the authority to direct or control other workers at or the operation of an adult entertainment establishment should be subject to penalties for allowing violations of this chapter to occur in order to deter and discourage such operators from allowing or encouraging violations of this article to occur for the purpose of increasing profits at the establishment to the detriment of the community and contrary to the purposes of this chapter 26 when reviewing applications for adult entertainment licenses the zoning administrators consideration of all information received in a timely manner from any of the investigating or reviewing departments will best protect the public and facilitate proper licensing consistent with the purposes of this chapter 27 the purpose of the suspension and revocation proceedings will be undermined if such suspensions or revocations are avoided by licensees being allowed to incorporate under new names or by attempts to transfer licenses or by change in control of land or establishments during a pending

as the concurrency management the city of palatka florida exh 1 6262008 authority this article is adopted pursuant to fs chs 125 and 163  florida administrative rule 9j5  the comprehensive plan  and the state constitution exh 1 6262008 findings and intent the city commission finds and determines that 1 the requirements and standards of this article are necessary for the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city and the protection of the environment and natural resources of the city  2 it is the intent of the city commission to implement the goals objectives and policies adopted in the comprehensive plan  3 it is the intent of the city commission that necessary public facilities and services be available concurrent with the impacts of development  4 it is the intent of the city commission that final development orders and permits be issued in a manner which does not result in a reduction of any levels of service below the adopted level of service standards in the comprehensive plan  5 it is the intent of the city commission to adhere to and implement the schedule of capital improvements in the comprehensive plan and other capital improvements as necessary to maintain the adopted level of service standards in the comprehensive plan  6 it is the intent of the city commission to adopt a reasonable concurrency management system in furtherance of the public benefit while at the same time ensuring that all property owners have a reasonable beneficial and economic use of their property and that no property is taken without just compensation  7 not all development or development activity impacts are significant enough to cause the deterioration of the levels of service adopted in the comprehensive plan it is therefore further found that the establishment of a de minimis developmental impact which will not cause an unacceptable degradation of levels of service is consistent with the goals objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan the application of this methodology by the establishment and recognition of certain types of de minimis development is found to be substantially related to the preservation of individual property rights in accordance with the state comprehensive plan exh 1 6262008 applicability a the regulations set forth in this article shall apply to all lands and waters within the incorporated area of the

and may be cited as the city of palatka wellhead protection  intent and purpose of article a groundwater is the principal source of fresh water for public supply rural industrial and agricultural purposes in the state in 198 the states average groundwater withdrawals totaled over 4000000000 gallons per day approximately 92 percent of the states population depends upon underground sources of water for its drinking water supply with approximately 20 percent of the population drinking untreated well water drawn directly from private wells b groundwater can become contaminated by many hazardous materials such as pesticides fertilizers organic compounds and human waste the degree of potential contamination depends upon soil characteristics contamination characteristics groundwater flow and other factors porous soils such as sand located over shallow aquifers overlain by heavy clay soils are less susceptible c there are many potential sources for groundwater contamination spills and ruptures from storage tanks can rapidly introduce dangerous pollutants into the aquifer slower leaks and nonpoint discharges from many sources along with regular infusion of septic tank effluent and contaminated stormwater runoff also can accumulate and eventually contaminate the aquifer d while the federal government environmental protection agency and the state department of environmental protection administer numerous programs relating to groundwater protection it is the local government using the police power established by the tenth amendment of the us constitution that is able to exercise greatest direct influence in groundwater protection subdivision and other ordinances this article is established to provide such influence e this article is further intended to safeguard the public health safety and welfare by providing for a zone of influence around wells serving the public establishing permitted land uses within a wellfield zone of influence and providing for the closure of unused wells  definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this article shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning aquifer means a formation group of formations or part of a formation that contains sufficient saturated permeable material to yield sufficient economical quantities of water to

serving residential communities as well as industrial commercial and recreational systems which supply potable water to employees customers andor the public  designation of wellhead protection zones criteria on which protection zone delineation can be based include distance drawdown of the water table water travel time within the aquifer flow system boundaries and the capacity of an aquifer to assimilate contaminants the distance criterion defines a protection zone by establishing a radius measured from a wellhead out to a particular distance this distance is known as the zone of influence or cone of depression as stated in the august 1995 report entitled wellhead protection area delineation prepared by the st johns river water management district 1 wellfield primary the extent of the
