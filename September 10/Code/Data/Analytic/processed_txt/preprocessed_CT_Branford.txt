statutory authorization the legislature of the state of connecticut has in c7 of the general statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the representative town meeting of branford connecticut does ordain as follows  1612 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of branford are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas caused by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages  1613 purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  15723 fire safety  1613  e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  1614 objectives the objectives of this chapter are a to protect human life and health b to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public d to minimize prolonged business interruptions e to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains f to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas g to insure that potential home buyers are notified
