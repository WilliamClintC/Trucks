of connecticut has in title 7 c7a and in title 8 of the general statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the east hampton planning & zoning commission of the town of east hampton connecticut does ordain as follows b finding of fact the flood hazard areas of the town of east hampton are subject to periodic flood inundation which results in the loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damage uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains can adversely affect the community the town of east hampton has voluntarily participated in the national flood insurance program nfip since  the nfip is founded on a mutual agreement between the federal government and each participating community local state and federal governments must share roles and responsibilities to meet the goals and objectives of the nfip the communitys role is of paramount importance property owners are able to receive federallysubsidized flood insurance only if the community enacts and enforces the minimum floodplain regulations required for participation in the nfip c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this regulation to regulate floodplain development promote public health safety and general welfare and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 to protect human life and health and prevent damage to property  2 to minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions and other economic disruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities infrastructure and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in the floodplain  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas in such a manner as to minimize flood damage and flood blight areas  7 to insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area  8 to prevent increase in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners  9 to ensure that those who occupy the flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions  and 10 to discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity use or structure outside of the floodplain 30 d objectives in order to accomplish its purposes this regulation includes objectives methods and provisions that 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to flood or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of barriers or obstructions which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands e definitions the words defined below shall apply to this the regulations unless specifically

general the planning and zoning commission recognizes that areas exist in the town of east hampton which are in close proximity to infrastructure required to support larger scale planned development incorporating a cohesive mixture of commercial residential recreational and lifestyle uses which will augment the economic development of the town of east hampton and provide employment housing and lifestyle opportunities within the town which currently do not exist the commission further recognizes that the assimilation of mixed uses which can occur in such a setting is not permitted under any individual zoning classification which is currently incorporated into the town of east hampton zoning ordinance the commission desires to create a legislative framework which will allow the type of development contemplated by this of the town of east hampton zoning ordinance with stringent controls which will allow the commission to ensure that the uses proposed within the district can be developed in harmony with each other giving due consideration to the availability of infrastructure to support such development in the district  and that the uses proposed in the district will be in harmony with adjoining neighborhoods and compliment rather than detract from the orderly development of the town b nature of the zone 1 the mixed use development district mudd will be a floating zone governed by a master plan in accordance with of these regulations the master plan will be subject to review and approval by the commission as a zone change subject to a public hearing and all other applicable terms and conditions of these regulations 2 it is recognized that the master plan may require fluidity in order to accommodate market changes during the complete development of any project notwithstanding the foregoing any substantial and material change will be subject to the same procedural requirements for a zone change as required by the original zone change application adopting the mixed use development district for purposes hereof a substantial and material change is a any reduction to any component of the mudd in excess of ten 10% percent thereof or ii any increase in the net square footage of all buildings in the mudd by more than ten 10% percent or iii any substantial change in the general layout and arrangement of uses and neighborhoods in the mudd which would alter the general character of the neighborhood settings of each phase of the mudd as approved by the commission b notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary no such reduction to any component of the mudd shall be authorized which would increase the percentage of residential to nonresidential uses in the mudd without the approval of a new master plan 3 except as provided in hereof the mixed use development district will supersede all preexisting zoning and any development of the zoned property owned andor controlled by the applicant will be subject to the specific requirements for the mixed use development district set forth herein and as delineated in the approved master plan c intent 1 unified and comprehensive design the mixed use development district is designed to encourage

of infrastructure to direct more intensive development to areas of the town where the highway connections pedestrian linkages public transportation utilities water and sewer facilities and topography will support such development in accordance with the recommendations of the towns plan of conservation and development 3 expand property tax base and employment opportunities use the incentives of higher density residential development and increased flexibility in overall development density and intensity to create an expanded nonresidential tax base for the town  to create attractive commercial recreational and lifestyle environments which address the needs of town and regional residents for shopping services and recreational opportunities  to create employment opportunities for existing and future residents  and to create open space and recreational facilities that do not rely on public funds for their establishment andor operation 4 increased residential diversity and opportunity provide housing for persons who due to age income health or lifestyle choice require or demand more compact residential patterns than are possible with either i conventional singlelot
