texas  tucson arizona  minneapolis minnesota  new hanover north carolina  los angeles california  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  and new york new york  the council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are currently uncontrolled or insufficiently controlled by the operators of the establishments 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this chapter as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theatres adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 according to the centers for disease control national center for hiv std and tb prevention as of january 199 there have been 8874 reported cases of people living with hiv infection 243 of whom are children under the age of 13 in the state of texas and 24253 reported cases of people living with aids 124 of whom are children under the age of 13 in the state of texas this report is attached as exhibit b of l16 8 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with close to 400000 cases being reported in 1999 9 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 10 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 11 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 12 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 13 the findings noted in subsections 1 12 raise substantial governmental concerns 14 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to address those substantial governmental concerns 15 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses furthermore such a licensing procedure will create an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 16 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres 17 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to retain information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 18 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 19 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable disease to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct that this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 20 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 21 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 22 the general welfare health and safety of the patrons and employees of sexually oriented businesses and the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter   l16  151 862002 definitions the

damage prevention a finding of fact purpose and methods 1 statutory authorization the legislature of the state of texas has in the flood control act texas water delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city of schertz texas the city does ordain as follows 2 finding of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city and extraterritorial jurisdiction are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage 3 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a protect human life and health b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public d minimize prolonged business interruptions e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas g ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area 4 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this the following methods a restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause increases in flood heights or velocities b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or substantial improvement c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands b definitions unless specifically defined below or in of this words or phrases used in this be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this most reasonable
