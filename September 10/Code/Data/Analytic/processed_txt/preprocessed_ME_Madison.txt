a significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency and should be updated and amplified in the light of the towns local situation and facts including the following b proper time for outdoor activities this community sense of the proper time for cessation of outdoor activities by minors on the streets is reflected in the curfew hours declared by this chapter which takes into consideration also the danger hours for nocturnal crime and for accumulations of minors with potential risks incident to immaturity c no commercial recreational facilities commercial recreational facilities for juveniles are almost nonexistent and there is little or nothing for minors to do outdoors but roam the streets after the curfew hours which this chapter declares d parental responsibility parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the norm legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a demonstrated effectiveness over the years as parental control increases likelihood of juvenile delinquency decreases and there is a continuing need for the nocturnal curfew for minors which has achieved and will continue to achieve under local conditions the purposes hereinbefore

addition or expansion does not increase the nonconformity of the structure and is in accordance with 1a and b below a after  if any portion of a structure is less than the required setback from the normal highwater line of a water body or tributary stream or the upland edge of a wetland that portion of the structure shall not be expanded as measured in floor area or volume by 30% or more during

structure may not be expanded if the original structure existing on  had been expanded by 30% in floor area and volume since that date b whenever a new enlarged or replacement foundation is constructed under a nonconforming structure the structure and new foundation must be placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board or its designee basing its decision on the criteria specified in  47812c2 relocation below if the completed foundation does not extend beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure except for expansion in conformity with  47812c1a above and the foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated by more than three additional feet as measured from the uphill side of the structure from

compliance with the water body tributary stream or wetland setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board or its designee in accordance with the purposes of

be any larger than the original structure except as allowed pursuant  47812 vehicles recreational  47812  to  47812c1 above as determined by the nonconforming floor area and volume of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location if the total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure when it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with  47812c2 above b any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value or damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the market value of the structure excluding normal maintenance and repair may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained from the officer within one year of such damage destruction or removal c in determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets

prohibition is provided in 30a mrsa  4406 for subdivisions and 38 mrsa  444 for shoreland zoning  5653 prerequisites for installing service therefore prior to installing service it is necessary to

who violates the provision of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment the town also reveres the right in its discretion to impose a lesser degree of discipline or refer the employee for drug counseling rehabilitation or some other form of employee assistance however the towns reservation of this right is not intended to create and does not create any right ion the part of any employee to a lesser degree of discipline or employee assistance d any employee who is convicted under criminal drug law based upon workplace conduct must notify the town manager in writing within five days of such conviction the town in turn will notify any applicable federal agency from which it receives a grant or contract of any employee workrelated
