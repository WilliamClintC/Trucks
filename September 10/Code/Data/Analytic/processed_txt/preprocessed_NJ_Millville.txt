industries or among existing industries and a prospective industry which is considering location within the city 1 when existing industries desire to trade credits other than bod5 and tss the industries doing the trading must demonstrate that the traded credit of a certain pollutant will result in the same or less loading of the particular pollutant from the combined industrial wastewater of the industries conducting the trading  5615 millville code  5615  2 when existing industries desire to trade bod5 or tss credits the industries can trade bod5 and tss credits equivalent to the difference in actual bod5 and tss loading discharged into the citys sewer system by the industry yielding the credits and the industry receiving the credits the difference would be computed using the maximum loading allowed for the industry yielding the credits as defined by the maximum allowed bod5 and tss concentrations in  5615d 3 when existing industries are trading credits the industries must submit 12 effluent wastewater data points that describe their wastewater characteristics for the pollutant for which trading rights are being applied all data must be a composite sample as defined herein the data must be temporally spaced over a minimum of three months 4 when an existing industry desires to trade bod5 or tss credits to a prospective industry the industries can trade bod5 and tss credits equivalent to the difference in actual bod5 and tss loading discharged into the citys sewer system by the industry yielding the credits and the industry receiving the credits the difference would be computed using the maximum loading allowed for the industry yielding the credits as defined by the maximum allowed bod5 and tss concentrations in  5615d 5 when an existing industry is trading bod5 and tss credits to a prospective industry the same data must be collected as required by 3 above however the data would need to be substantiated by the prospective industry during the

measures 1 the industrys application should consist of a letter signed by the principal executive officer familiar with the daytoday operation of the wastewater treatment facility stating the details of the requested change this letter must be accompanied by an engineering report that addresses the water conservation measures including an estimate of the water volume reduction and  5615 licensing

the industry is requesting a change of concentration limit for the preceding twelvemonth period must be submitted with the application to define the existing baseline conditions the flow data must be in the form of daily flow records and the pollutant data must be at least representative of 24 hours composite sampling once per month in all cases the city will seek to approve only those applications where water use is the only component of change of wastewater characteristics if other process changes are being performed and are necessary to be performed to allow the decrease of water use calculations must be submitted showing the change of pollutant concentration resulting from the process changes separate from the change of pollutant concentration resulting from water conservation measures 2 in no case will the city approve a higher pollutant loading to the sewage treatment system as a result of the industrys application for change of concentration limit for that pollutant because of water conservation measures 3 once approved for a change of concentration limit under this application procedure an industry must submit daily wastewater flow data additionally
