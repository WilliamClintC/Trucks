potw and the deposit of wastewater and waste hauled to the wrf or to locations approved by the wra director for disposal and treatment the objectives of this chapter are 1to prevent the introduction of pollutants into the potw that may interfere with the operation of the system or interfere with sludge management and disposal  2to prevent the introduction of pollutants into the potw that may pass system inadequately treated and ultimately into receiving water the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system  3to protect workers safety and health and to protect against damage to the potw  4to provide for equitable distribution of treatment and industrial pretreatment costs resulting from pollutants introduced into the potw 10006 jurisdiction the provisions of this chapter are

practical the final document is required to be one compact disk cd in the ibm disk format with a pdf file that contains all pages of the pud generally existing conditions should be illustrated on a separate sheet for sake of clarity although existing topography access utility and sewer lines and other items that are appropriate for understanding the proposal should also appear on the proposed development plan it is strongly recommended that an architect landscape architect and civil engineer be employed to prepare the plans the commission or council may require any additional information which may be needed to evaluate the proposed pud on the basis of special or unforeseen circumstances or may waive any of the above requirements if it is found that such information is unnecessary to properly evaluate the proposed pud 4development controls although puds are intended to promote and permit flexibility of design and thereby may involve modifications of conventional regulations or standards certain requirements which are set forth below shall be applied to ensure that the development is compatible with the intent of this zoning any use that is approved and made a part of the master plan subject to any conditions attached thereto shall be permitted bheight setback bulk and other requirements set out in the master plan shall constitute the basis for and become the zoning requirement for that particular pud provided that refinements may be made plan approval if not defined as a substantial modification  in lack of any special provisions set out in the master plan the requirements of the most proximate zoning district as defined by use shall be applied cproject phases shall be substantially and functionally selfcontained and selfsustaining with regard to access parking utilities open space screening and transitional elements and other support features and be capable of supporting required operation and maintenance activities  temporary provisions such as turnarounds or access easements may be required for this purpose  the initial phases generally should not be comprised of the most intensive portions of the pud unless the city concurs this is the most feasible means of developing the property in terms of access sewer service or similar physical constraints or will permit earlier development of common amenities dattention shall be given to mitigation of existing or potential land use conflicts orientation open space setbacks landscaping and screening grading traffic circulation and architectural compatibility it is the intent of this section to recognize that appropriate use of design techniques will provide the required mitigation and thereby eliminate the need for certain conventional regulations or standards examples of design techniques not requirements are orienting views access and principal activities away from the land use needing protection by placing those least compatible activities farthest from the common boundary and those compatible nearest to create an effective buffer  using setbacks in conjunction with landscaping can mitigate conflicts by providing a visual buffer controlling pedestrian access softening visual contrast by subduing differences in architecture and bulk and reducing heat generated by development and the use of dense landscaping can reduce the width of physical separations needed for such purposes  the use of proper grading will control drainage can alter views subdue sound and channel access  fences walls and berms can be used to channel access and control visual sound and light pollution  proper architectural use of color bulk materials and shape will enhance compatibility and reduce contrast although details added to the building for esthetic purpose without consideration to form and surroundings may be detrimental rather than helpful  and proper design of pedestrian ways streets and points of access and proper location of parking areas will reduce congestion and safety hazards and help prevent introduction of noise pollutants and other conflicts into areas with less intensive land use other techniques may also be used epermanent care and maintenance of common elements such as open space recreation amenities and others shall be provided in a legally binding form if the common elements are to be maintained by a home owners association the applicant shall

amended delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare 2findings of fact the flood hazard areas of the city of ankeny are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare of the community these flood losses hazards and related adverse effects are caused by i the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flooding  and ii the cumulative effect of obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities this ordinance relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the department of natural resources 3purpose it is the purpose of this section to protect and preserve the rights privileges and property of ankeny and its residents and to preserve and improve the peace safety health welfare and comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing flood losses with provisions designed to areserve sufficient flood plain area for the conveyance of flood flows so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially  brestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood height or velocities  crequire that uses vulnerable to floods including public utilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  dprotect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard  and eassure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the city to purchase flood insurance national flood insurance program 4compliance no structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be located extended converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this other applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this zoning considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study larger floods may occur on rare occasions flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris the ordinance codified in this section does not imply that areas outside the flood plain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages this section shall not create liability on the part of ankeny or any officer

inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in paragraph e of subsection 1 may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs the former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots the latter situation wastes money as well as space that could more desirably be used for valuable development or environmentally useful open space therefore the department director may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of paragraph e and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in paragraph 1a of this section bwithout limiting the generality of the foregoing the department director may allow deviations from the parking requirements set forth in paragraph 1e of this section when i a residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly  or ii a business is primarily oriented to walkin trade cwhenever the department director allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive requirements set forth in paragraph 1e of this section the director shall enter on the face of the permit the information indicating the requirement to be imposed and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation dif the department director concludes based upon information received in the consideration of a specific development proposal that the presumption established by paragraph 1e of this section for a particular use classification is erroneous the director shall initiate a request for amendment to the table of parking requirements in accordance with appropriate procedures eany person aggrieved by the actions of the department director may within ten days of such decision file with the clerk a notice of appeal specifying the reasons therefor the zoning board of adjustment shall thereupon fix a reasonable time for the hearing on such appeal and notify the parties accordingly at such hearing the zoning board of adjustment may affirm the decision of the department director or may modify said decision by requiring more or less parking spaces if necessary to insure compliance with the intent of this section 3offstreet display and storage areas in all districts in connection with every industrial commercial

feet or greater 3% 8000 square feet to 24999 square feet 5% 2499 square feet or less to 7999 square feet 10%  2the ankeny comprehensive plan as adopted by the city and the criteria and standards contained in the subdivision regulations shall be used as guidelines in locating sites and determining site size bdetermination of minimum lot area requirements in determining the minimum lot area that is required per unit the lot area requirements of the zoning district in which the plat is located shall govern if the plat is located within zoning district c1  c2  or c2a and will not be used for residential purposes no park land dedication shall be required provided that the developer submits restrictive covenants running with the land for a period of no less than 20 years and in a form approved by the city attorney warranting that the land within the plat will not be used for residential purposes if the plat lies within any zoning district which permits residential uses and in the event the developer desires to reduce the maximum density of such development use of restrictive covenants the maximum density permitted under such covenants shall be determinative provided that such covenants are submitted in a form approved by the city attorney crelease of covenants such covenants shall run in favor of the city only in the event that subsequent to the filing of such covenants and approval of the final plat the owner chooses to increase the density of the plat in excess of that permitted in such covenants said owner may obtain a release of such covenant upon dedication to the city of the amount of land which would otherwise have been dedicated under this section or the amount of cash contribution which would have been accepted after being credited with any amount of land or cash contribution previously dedicated or paid dpayment in lieu of park land where dedication of land is not compatible with the general subdivision plan of the developer the developer may request the city to accept a cash payment in lieu of the dedication of such land in this event the developer may pay to the city a cash payment as hereinafter determined which shall be placed in a special fund by the city and shall be used solely for the acquisition andor development of park and recreational lands to serve the residents of the city 1method of payment the payment in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the development that otherwise would have been dedicated as a park site the fair market value shall be determined by the city by taking the total peracre value of the total development and determining the proportionate value of the dedication of land required as determined under paragraph a of this subsection for purposes of this section fair market value shall be determined by the following method aat the first meeting in january of each year the mayor with the approval of the council shall appoint a committee of three persons having knowledge of real estate values in the city by reason of their occupations such as realtors appraisers and persons responsible for making loans on property this committee shall be referred to as the valuation committee bthe valuation committee shall thereupon make a study of the average peracre value of undeveloped real estate within the city limits giving due consideration to sales of such real estate during the preceding year and shall based upon all available information make a determination of the average market value of all undeveloped land lying within the city the committee shall thereupon make the recommendation to the council cthe council shall by resolution thereupon establish the average peracre fair market value which shall be used to determine the basis for the cash contribution permitted under this section until such value is changed or amended by subsequent resolution 2percentage contribution in no event shall any payments required under the provisions of this section be in a greater percentage in relation to the total value of the land within the plat than the maximum required percentage of total land area as set forth in paragraph a of this subsection 3criteria for requiring dedication and a payment in lieu of land there may be situations when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both advisable these occasions will arise when aonly a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a park site that portion of the land within the subdivision falling within the park location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid and a payment in lieu of land shall be accepted for any additional land that would have to be dedicated ba major part of the local park or recreational site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site the remaining portions shall be required by dedication and a payment in lieu thereof may be accepted especial fund all payments in lieu of park land collected by the city shall be deposited in a special fund to be known and designated as special fund for the acquisition and development of park and recreational facilities and such funds shall be used for such purposes and at such places and in such manner as shall be determined and directed by the city following recommendations by the park board after consultation with the subdivider or developer and which shall be consistent with the intent of paragraph c of this subsection  and authorization for creation of said fund is granted any and all interest accumulated upon such funds shall be added to the special fund and be used only for acquisition and development of parks and recreational areas fprocedures 1preapplication
