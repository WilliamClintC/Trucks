houses including additions of porches or decks  accessory buildings including carriage houses  and a complete new structure 1 general design considerations  a new construction of primary buildings such as dwellings should reflect the historic and architectural character of the district in building scale massing proportions and materials new construction should reflect its own era however and not attempt to be falsely historic b additions should reflect the building scale massing proportions and materials of the original building additions should be designed to blend with character of the original building c accessory buildings should reflect the general style of the primary building but are not required to replicate the style in detail 2 building placement  a placement of new buildings and additions should reflect the placement of surrounding buildings on the block face b new construction shall meet the established front yard setback line or fall within the range established for that block face c new construction shall conform to the established side yard setback pattern for that block face 3 building massing and proportions a height and width  the proportions of new construction should respect the average height and width of the majority of buildings on the block face 4 building elements a windows and doors  1 most windows within the district have a vertical orientation with proportions of 2 or 3 to 1 height to width the proportion size rhythm and detailing of windows and doors in new construction should be compatible with that of adjacent buildings but need not exactly replicate them 2 internal window divisions mullions should match the original building on walls facing the street on nonstreet facades or rear walls oneoverone wood sash may be substituted for more complex mullion patterns 3 window openings should be recessed to create a pattern of light and shadow see renovation standards on window material b roofs  roofs of new buildings or additions should be compatible in pitch shape and materials with the principal building or nearby buildings no vents skylights or other openings should be located on the front roof plane or sides visible from the street c decks  unenclosed decks are incompatible with the character and historical period of the district decks shall be constructed only at the rear of buildings or where they are least conspicuous from the public way decks should not extend beyond the width of the building d entries  entries should be located on the facade facing the public way entries to new principal buildings should be articulated with a porch or portico similar in character to nearby buildings e exterior details  exterior details such as building trim or window and door hardware should be generally compatible with the style and materials of the original building but need not replicate every detail of the original building 5 building materials  building materials used in new construction should conform to those used on existing contributing buildings within the district masonry wood siding and wood shingles however if approved by the hpc synthetic siding may be used on accessory buildings such as carriage houses to simulate horizontal lapsiding cementitious siding hardiplank is the most satisfactory in simulating wood siding 6 additions  exterior additions to existing buildings can radically alter their appearance additions that are visible from a public street or sidewalk should be designed with scale shape and materials that are consistent with those of the existing building however the addition should not be disguised as original the use of the same wall plane roof line or cornice height as the original building is not recommended a additions on sides of buildings are discouraged while additions at the rear of a building should not extend beyond the width of the building b the roof of an addition should be lower in height than the main roof of the existing building but compatible in pitch shape and materials c the foundation of an addition should match the material or appearance of the original foundation and should also match the foundation sill height of the existing structure to present an unbroken line around the buildings groundlevel perimeter 7 accessory buildings  accessory buildings include carriage houses garages and other small buildings a carriage houses  carriage houses are among the characterdefining features of the tenth and cass neighborhood historic district originally designed as small barns they now generally function as garages although their height allows for other uses such as home offices as a unique type of accessory building carriage houses in the citys older neighborhoods are subject to special provisions in this chapter allowing greater height and building coverage this chapter provides general design guidance for carriage houses the architecture of the accessory structure shall be historically compatible with the architecture of the primary structure appropriate to the period the architecture of the accessory structure is not required to match the architecture of the primary structure so long as the architecture is appropriate to the period the following standards apply to carriage houses and other accessory buildings as well 1 placement on lot outbuildings shall be located in rear yards with vehicular access from the alley in keeping with the established pattern 2 wooden garage doors are recommended but not required metal doors where used should be simple in shape and without ornamentation 3 windows should generally match the shape of windows on the principal building but may be smaller in size consistent with the scale of the building and may employ simpler divisions oneoverone wood sash or windows with fixed simulated muntins 4 materials similar to those of the principal building are preferred however if approved by the hpc synthetic cementitious siding such as hardiplank or vinyl siding may be used to simulate wood siding with a profile and lap exposure similar to that of the principal building g site design  most houses within the district with or without porches are set back a relatively even distance from the street front yards are typical of many residential neighborhoods many have lawns extending to the sidewalk while others have low ornamental fences or stone walls at the edge of the sidewalk some lawns slope upwards slightly from the street level many houses have foundation plantings and mature shrubs are found within most yards boulevards with evenly spaced canopy trees are located between the sidewalk and the street all these elements give a pedestrian scale to the street and create a transition between public and private spaces driveways are typically concrete and singlelane in width most driveways take access from alleys to detached carriage houses or garages or parking areas at the rear of each lot there is currently only one offstreet surface parking lot within the district  providing parking for an adjacent medical office outside the district the alleyscape differs from the streetscape alleys bisect every block within the district and provide access to most garage and parking areas with the exception of outbuildings on a few corner lots most rear yards are separated from the alley by a fence or wall usually higher than those in the front yard and by the wall of the carriage house or garage improvements or changes in site design should be consistent with the pattern described above 1 offstreet parking shall be located to the rear of the principal building in locations that are least visible from the street 2 surface parking areas visible from the street shall be fenced with ornamental iron or painted wooden fences or low stone walls fencing within front yards shall be no higher than four feet 3 wooden or ornamental iron fences are encouraged along rear lot lines abutting the alley 4 front yards may remain open to the street or may be fenced if desired with ornamental iron or painted wooden fences or low stone walls fencing shall be no higher than four feet in order to allow visibility into front yards 5 air conditioners heat pumps and other outdoor equipment should be located where they are least visible from the street 6 in planting strips along the street canopy trees should be added to fill in locations where they are lacking h appeal  applicants may appeal any hpc decision to the common council an appeal shall be in writing specifying the grounds upon which the appeal is based and shall be filed with the city clerk within 30 days of the date of the decision of the hpc that is being appealed 38g   iattch 1142016 design standards for the

chapter is based upon the division of the city into districts within which districts the use of land and buildings and size and location of buildings and structures in relation to the use of land are mutually compatible and substantially uniform however there are certain uses which because of their unique characteristics cannot be properly classified as unrestricted permitted uses in any particular district or districts without consideration in each case of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land or public facilities and of the public need for the particular use at a particular location such uses nevertheless may be necessary or desirable to be allowed in a particular district provided that due consideration is given to location development and operation of such uses such uses are classified as conditional uses and fall into two categories a uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest b uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities 2 the following provisions are established to regulate these conditional uses which require special consideration a standards  no application for a conditional use shall be recommended approved or granted by the city plan commission unless the commission shall find all of the following 1 that the establishment maintenance or operation of the conditional use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health safety or welfare 2 that the city will be able to provide municipal services to the property where the conditional use is proposed given due consideration of the costs of providing such services 3 that the uses values and enjoyment of
