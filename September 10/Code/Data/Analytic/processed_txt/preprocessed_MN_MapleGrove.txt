streets sidewalks and other public places ch 28 purpose a commercial mining stripping excavating and extracting activities are now being and for some time have been conducted in certain places within the corporate limits of the city in order to remove from the ground black dirt sand gravel and other minerals or substances existing on in or under such place b the city finds that the extraction of minerals by surface mining is a basic and essential activity making an important contribution to the economic wellbeing of the city the economical availability of sand gravel rock soil and other materials is vital to the continued growth of the region and the city the city further finds that it is not practicable to extract minerals required by society without disturbing the surface of the earth and producing waste materials the danger exists that noncompatible land uses could unnecessarily deny the benefit of these materials to society in the future it is further found that the character of mining may create undesirable land and water conditions which can be detrimental to the health safety and welfare and property rights of the citizens of the city however if properly regulated and if rehabilitation of surface mined lands is required mining can take place within the city in such a manner that undesirable side effects of the operation may be restricted to an acceptable level c the purposes of this article are to provide for the economical availability of sand gravel rock soil and other materials vital to the continued growth of the region and the city to establish reasonable and uniform limitations safeguards and controls in the city for the future production of such minerals and to control and minimize pollution caused by erosion or sedimentation all

building constructed of wood frame  provided none of the aforementioned buildings make use of any metal construction or any below grade levels or parking areas any part of any r3 occupancy building including below grade levels and parking areas are exempt from the requirements of this section for the purposes of this section parking structures and stairwells are included in the definition of building and stair shafts and elevators are included in the definition of all parts of the building for purposes of this section adequate radio coverage shall be an average received field strength of no less than 93 dbm or one percent ber measured at 30 to 36 inches above the floor over 90 percent of the area of each floor and other critical areas determined by the fire chief or the fire chiefs designee such as fire command centers stairwells elevators high hazard areas basements and parking areas without an inbuilding radio system only the received signal level standard must be achieved as the talk out path is equivalent to the talk in path in this regional radio system  262006 amplification systems allowed buildings and structures which cannot support the required level of radio coverage shall be equipped with either a radiating cable system or an internal multiple antenna system with or without fcc type accepted bidirectional 800 mhz amplification as needed if amplification is used in the system all required fcc authorizations must be obtained prior to the use of the system if any part of the installed system or systems contains an electrically powered component the system shall be capable of operating on an independent battery andor generator system for a period of at least 12 hours without external power input the battery system shall automatically charge in the presence of an external power input  262006 testing procedures a acceptance test procedure with or without an inbuilding radio system it will be the building owners responsibility to have the regional radio system performance tested to ensure that twoway coverage on each floor of the building is a minimum of 90 percent of the total floor area and the critical areas designated 1 talkin from the regional radio system coverage testing a the talkin coverage testing process shall be the same for buildings with and without inbuilding amplification systems b during test measuring the center of the test equipment receive antenna shall be between 30 and 36 inches above the floor c on each floor of a building to be tested the floor space except for designated critical areas shall be divided into square or rectangular areas of approximately the same size and shape each floor shall have at least ten grid areas  however the maximum size of grid areas shall not exceed 2500 square feet in buildings with support columns laid out in a grid the corners of the each grid may be arranged at the columns for ease in identifying grid corners while testing is in progress in buildings such as a warehouse with large open areas tests shall be conducted near the center of each grid although the exact center may not be easily accessible due to the location of large machinery storage racks etc in buildings with divided office spaces with or without floor to ceiling patricians tests shall be conducted in an office at or near the center of a grid in buildings with a large open area and an attached twostory split level office or other area the lower level of the twostory split level attachment shall be considered as an extension of the large open area d in multistory buildings and parking ramps testing shall begin at the lowest level including any subgrade levels and continue up one floor at a time inbuilding amplification may only be required on the lowest level or levels of a multistory building or parking ramp e average radio signal field strength shall be measured and recorded in each grid and in each designated critical area defined above average field strength may be obtained of an instantaneous measuring instrument and a computer that samples the actual field strength at very short time intervals and averages the sample values as an alternative a field strength measuring instrument with an analog or digital readout of average field strength may also be used measurements shall be made while the measuring instrument is moved over a distance of four to ten feet if the average field strength varies over the measurement path the lowest most negative value shall be recorded the test instrumentation used shall have been calibrated within the sixmonth period prior to the testing f the percentage of area passed shall be calculated as 100 times the result of dividing the number of grids and critical areas that are at least at 93 dbm or one percent ber by the total number of grids and critical areas tested g the donor antenna in an inbuilding amplification system may receive up to 87 800 mhz radio frequencies of approximately equal field strength from the regional system plus some others of approximately equal field strength from other radio systems at any time the donor antenna may be receiving at least 60 radio frequencies of approximately equal level in the pass band ranges for that reason it shall be assumed that the output level of talkin amplifiers will be at + 32 dbm per channel maximum therefore grid and critical areas tests shall be conducted while the head end amplifier is disconnected and a signal of + 32 dbm is inserted into the connector downstream from the headend amplifier h any inbuilding talkin amplification system shall have pass band filters before the input to the first headend amplifier that shall pass 806 to 817 mhz and 821824 mhz only in the future within six months after notification by the fire chief or his designee the pass band filter frequency range shall be changed in accordance with instructions or an additional pass band filter for 700 mhz band frequencies shall be added when the donor antenna is installed the average signal level received on the hennepin east site control channel shall be measured at the antenna connector a signal at that average received signal level shall be inserted into the cable to the headend amplifier and filter while the output level of the headend amplifier is measured and the output level of the amplifier shall be set at + 29 + 1 dbm i alternative inbuilding amplification systems that do not involve broadband pass band filters will be accepted provided that similar testing can be demonstrated 2 talkout to the regional radio system testing a with an inbuilding amplification system the talkout to the regional 800 mhz radio system shall be measured at the same grid and critical area locations as the talkin measurements were made the measurements shall be made using a threewatt portable radio with a wellcharged battery to transmit into the inbuilding radio system while field strength is measured out of the connector that is normally attached to the donor antenna to pass the field strength at the donor antenna shall be the measured value at the connector plus the donor antenna gain and minus a free space loss factor the free space loss factor shall be 93 db for a distance of one mile to the nearest hennepin east base radio location adjusted by 6 db each time the distance is halved or doubled the acceptable range for passing shall be between 65 and 95 dbm b gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be verified each year during the annual tests in the event that the measurement results become lost the building owner will be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values  262006 annual tests when an inbuilding radio system is required the building owner shall test all active components of the system including but not limited to amplifiers power supplies and backup batteries a minimum of once every 12 months amplifiers shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial installation and acceptance backup batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load for a period of one hour to verify that they will properly operate during an actual power outage if within the onehour test period in the opinion of the testing technician the battery exhibits symptoms of failure the test shall be extended for additional onehour periods until the testing technician confirms the integrity of the battery all other active components shall be checked to determine that they are operating within the manufacturers specifications for the intended purpose  262006 fiveyear tests in addition to the annual test the building owner shall perform a radio coverage test a minimum of once every five years to ensure that the radio system continues to meet the requirements of the original acceptance test a radio test shall also be performed whenever there is a change in or to the building that may have an impact on coverage examples of the types of changes that may change radio coverage are interior remodeling that adds andor changes partitions removal of windows and the addition of metalized treatment to window surfaces the procedure described in section 18218a1 shall be used for these tests  262006 qualifications of testing personnel all tests shall be conducted documented and signed by qualified and competent personnel that includes persons in possession of a current fcc license or a current technician certification issued by the associated publicsafety communications officials international apco or the personal communications industry association pcia or a qualified radio engineer licensed as a registered professional

any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result b variances may only be issued upon i a showing of good and sufficient cause  ii a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and iii a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or divisions c variances may only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief 4 flood insurance notice the zoning administrator must notify the applicant for a variance that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500
