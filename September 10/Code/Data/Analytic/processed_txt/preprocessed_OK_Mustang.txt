of persons residing or working on property in proximity to such operations 3 oil and gas well drilling and production activities in the absence of local regulatory controls may generate noxious aerial emissions introduce contaminants into groundwater emit high noise or light levels produce large volumes of dust congest local streets present fire or chemical spill hazards and produce other deleterious effects all of which fall disproportionately on adjacent land uses and which can result individually or cumulatively in injury to persons or damage to property and inhibit the quiet peace and enjoyment of the surface uses of real property in the vicinity of such operations 4 the proliferation of oil and gas well pad sites within the city creates conflicts between such development and other existing and future surface uses of real property within the city to assure the compatibility of residential commercial industrial and agricultural uses with oil and gas well development it is

three material classifications will be allowed as bedding materials when the soil type has been classified by an approved testing laboratory 1 class i angular onefourth to 1 inches six to 40 mm graded stone including a number of fill materials that have regional significance such as coral slag cinders crushed shell and crushed stone note the size range and resulting high voids ration of class i material make it suitable for use to dewater trenches during pipe installation this permeable characteristic dictates that its use be limited to locations where pipe supports will not be lost by migration of fine grained natural material from the trench walls and bottom or migration of other embedment materials into the class i material when such migration is possible the materials minimum size range could be reduced to finer than onefourth inch mm and the gradation properly designed to limit the size of the voids 2 class ii coarse sands and gravels with maximum particle size of 1 inches 40 mm including variously graded sands and gravels containing small percentages of fines generally granular and noncohesive either wet or dry soil types gw gp sw and sp are included in this class note sands and gravels which are clean or borderline between clean and with fines should be included coarsegrained soils with less than 12 percent but more than five percent fines are neglected in astm d2487 and the uscs and should be included the gradation of class ii material influences its density and pipe support strength when loosely placed the gradation of class ii materials may be critical to the pipe support and stability of the foundation and embedment if the material is imported and is not native to the trench excavation a gradation other than well graded such as uniformly graded or gap graded may permit loss of support by migration into void spaces of a finer grained natural material from the trench wall and bottom 3 class iii fine sand and clayey clay filled gravels including fine sands sandclay mixtures and gravelclay mixtures solid types gm cg sm and sc are included in this class  methods of placing embedment materials the following compaction methods are recommended as the optimums which will achieve desirable densities with the least effort 1 manufactured angular granular materials manufactured materials which are angular granular such as broken coral crushed stone or rock crushed shells crushed slag or cinders which have a maximum size of 1 inches 40 mm may be placed on loose dumping with a maximum of compactive effort except that care shall be taken to assure proper placement of material under pipe haunches 2 clean granular soils with coarsegrained soils containing less than five percent fines such as gw gp sw sp gwgp and swsp the maximum density will be obtained by compacting by saturation or vibration if internal vibrators are used the height of successive lifts or backfill shall be limited to the penetrating depth of the vibrator if surface vibrators are used the backfill should be placed in lifts of six to 12 inches 150 to 300 mm this material may also be compacted by tamping or other means provided that the desired relative density is obtained 3 coarsegrained soils with little to no fines coarsegrained soils which are borderline between clean and with fines containing between five to 12 percent fines such as gwgm swsm gwgc swsc gpgm spsm gpgc and spsc should be compacted by either hand or mechanical tamping saturation or vibration or whichever method meets the required density 4 coarsegrained soils with fines coarsegrained soils containing more than 12 percent fines such as gm gc sm sc and the borderline cases in the group eg gmsm should be compacted by hand or mechanical tamping the backfill should be placed in lifts of four to six inches 100 to 150 mm 5 finegrained soils finegrained soils such as mh ch ml cl sccl smml and mlcl should be compacted by hand or mechanical tamping in lifts of four to six inches 100 to 150 mm 6 tamping and vibrating soils which require compaction by tamping or vibrating generally reach maximum density with a minimum of effort when controlled to optimum moisture content 7 saturation if flooding jetting or puddling is employed for compaction care should be taken to provide drainage and prevent flotation of the pipe saturation shall not be permitted during freezing weather erosion of support at the pipe sides and bottom by water jetting shall be prevented apply only enough water to give complete saturation allow time for the saturated soil in each layer to dewater and solidify until it will support the weight of workers 8 use of compaction equipment take care to avoid contact between the pipe and compaction equipment do not use compaction equipment directly over the pipe until sufficient backfill has been placed to assure that such equipment will not damage or disturb the sewer pipe 9 bedding sand is preferred but class i ii or iii soil is required primarily to bring the trench bottom up to grade bedding materials shall be placed to provide uniform and adequate longitudinal support under the pipe blocking shall not be used to bring the pipe to grade bell holes at each joint shall be provided to permit the joint to be assembled properly while maintaining uniform pipe support a compacted depth of four to six inches 100 to 150 mm is generally sufficient bedding thickness in trenches which have natural materials of fine grains and in conditions where migration of trench wall material into bedding material can be anticipated either wide trench construction or well graded bedding material without void shall be used 10 haunching the most important factor affecting water pipe performance and deflection is the haunching material and its density place and consolidate the material under the pipe haunch to provide adequate side support to the pipe while avoiding both vertical and lateral displacement of the pipe from proper alignment where coarse materials with voids have been used for bedding coarse materials shall also be used for haunching and consideration shall be given to using wide trench construction place haunching up to the pipe spring line 11 initial backfill initial backfill begins above the spring line of the pipe use little or no tamping of the initial backfill since this area will provide little or no additional side support the only purpose of extending the initial backfill to levels over the top of the pipe shall be to protect the pipe from impact damage resulting from any large objects in

acceptance of the work  trench construction  generally trenches shall be excavated to the alignment and elevations as indicated on the sewer plans any deviations must be approved by the city engineer all trench excavation shall comply with applicable regulations laws and ordinances specified in this division are standard construction requirements covering a broad range of both normal and unusual conditions that can be anticipated in sewer trench excavation and construction some items or work are specified as options to the contractor which does not need city engineer approval however some options do require the city engineers approval  conflicting obstructions conflicting obstructions may be encountered when excavating the construction sewers without deviations from the location established by the sewer system drawings the contractor shall be responsible for all conflicting surface and subsurface structures utilities and obstructions the contractor shall be responsible to call oklahoma onecall system at 18005226543 48 hours prior to any excavation the contractor shall bear all expense arising from obstructions encountered  removal of improved surfaces unless specified

the work is completed gutters shall be kept open or other satisfactory provisions made for street drainage and natural watercourses shall not be obstructed adjacent to streets walks or driveways  disposal of debris removed pavement and waste excavation no debris shall be disposed of in the trench backfill debris removed pavement and excavation which is surplus or unsuitable for backfill shall be disposed of by the contractor in a manner suitable to the city  dewatering where conditions are such that running or standing water occurs in the trench bottom or the soil in the trench bottom displays a quick tendency the water shall be removed by pumps and suitable means such as well points or pervious underdrain bedding until the pipe has been installed and the backfill has been placed to a sufficient height necessary to prevent flotation of the sewer line care shall be taken that any underdrain is of proper gradation and thickness to prevent migration of material between the underdrain pipe embedment and native soils in the trench below at the sides of the sewer pipe  trench excavation and support the maximum earthload on flexible pipe results from the consolidated prism of earth directly over the pipe which is only as wide as the pipe the load on flexible pipe does not increase in excess of the prism load as it does with rigid pipe if the design load on the pipe is calculated based on embankment conditions prism load the contractor may excavate a trench which is as wide as is dictated by practical and economical construction types of construction for various anticipated conditions are described as follows 1 narrow unsupported verticalwalled trench the amount of pavement to be removed and replaced amount of rock excavation or the amount of embedment material used may dictate that the most economical installation uses narrow verticalwalled trenches the width of narrow trenches as determined by the minimum working room for a man to place haunching material shall provide a minimum of 18 inches 450 mm for fourinch to sixinch 100 and 150 mm size pipes and not less than sixinch to nineinch 150 to 230 mm clearance on each side of the pipe for

42 33 14 46 36 14 50 40 14 56 48 13 62 note minimum trench widths are intended to provide adequate spacing between the pipe and trench wall for proper placing and compaction of haunching material and may vary somewhat depending on construction procedures being used 2 unsupported subditch trench a variation of the narrow verticalwalled trench is to lay the pipe in a subditch and backcut or slope the sides of the excavation above the top of the pipe as shown in figure 2 this type of construction may be permitted by the city engineer where no inconvenience to the public or damage to the property building subsurface structures or pavements will result in such case width of the subditch below the top of the pipe shall comply with table 1 example of subtrench figure 2 3 wide trench wide trenches are classified as trenches whose width at the top of the pipe is greater than 2 pipe diameters on each side of the pipe or a total of six pipe diameters although there is no width of trench beyond which the load on a flexible pipe exceeds the prism load accepted installation practices usually dictate narrow trench construction in isolated circumstances it may be more cost effective to use wide trench construction ie in areas where narrow trench walls cannot be maintained if trench width at the top of a small diameter pipe six inchesten inches diameter must exceed six pipe diameters the embedment up to the pipe springline should be compacted to a point approximately 2 pipe diameters from each side of the pipe for large diameter pvc sdr35 pipe 12 inches48 inches diameter installed in wide trenches the embedment up to the pipe springline should be compacted to a point at least one pipe diameter or two feet 600 mm from each side of the pipe whichever is greater 4 supported trench where an unstable or flowing soil condition is encountered in the trench wall such as may be found by excavation below groundwater or in weak or noncohesive soils stabilize this condition before laying the pipe depending upon the severity of the condition the city engineer or contractor may elect to use tight sheeting skeleton sheeting stay bracing trench jacks or a trench shield or box to support the trench during pipe laying operations if the condition is too severe it may be necessary to leave any sheeting in place or to use chemical or cement grouting of the soil adjacent to the excavation to prevent migration between the material used beneath and around the pipe and trench wall material to allow sufficient working room plus trench wall supports the minimum excavated trench width to the outside of the sheeting or shield box shall be as shown in table 2 table 2 supported trench widths minimum trench width minimum nominal pipe sizes diameter inches number of pipe diameter inches 6 57 36 8 43 36 10 40 42 12 34 42 15 31 48 18 27 48 21 24 50 24 22 52 27 21 56 30 20 60 33 19 63 36 19 68 40 18 72 48 17 81 table 2 widths are based upon eight to ten inches 200 to 250 mm clearance on each side of the pipe to the inner face of trench supports the trench supports are assumed to be sixinch 150 mm thick trench box or shield walls or fourinch 100 mm walls inside of twoinch 50 mm sheeting exceptionally deep trenches with thicker sheeting and bracing or other systems of trench support may require the city engineer to vary these trench widths timber sheeting where used below the top of the pipe shall be driven approximately two feet 60 cm below the bottom of the pipe and be left in place approximately 1 feet 45 cm above the top of the pipe in supported trenches compaction of foundation and embedment materials should extend to the trench wall or sheeting left in place  trench bottom the soil surface at the trench bottom shall be free of any protrusions which may cause point loading on any portion of the pipe or bell and shall provide a firm stable and uniform support for the pipe 1 special trench foundation where an unsuitable trench bottom condition is encountered it must be stabilized by a method approved by the city engineer andor chief building official 2 overexcavation during the course of construction should the contractor inadvertently overexcavate the trench more than six inches 150 mm below the bottom of the pipe but less than 12 inches 300 mm below the bottom of the pipe he shall fill that area of overexcavation with acceptable embedment material and compact to a density approximately equal to the native soil 3 rock subgrade ledge rock hard pan cobbles boulders or stones larger than 1 inches 40 mm shall be removed from the trench bottom to permit a minimum bedding thickness of four to six inches 100 to 150 mm under pipe sharp stones and crushed rock larger than threefourths inch which could cause significant scratching or abrasion of the pipe should be excluded from the embedment material  embedment materials all sdr35 and schedule 40 sewer pipe shall be bedded in river sand as approved by the city engineer andor chief building official 1 use of compaction equipment take care to avoid contact between the pipe and compaction equipment do not use compaction equipment directly over the pipe until sufficient

planned unit developments footnotes  11  state law reference planned unit developments 11 os  43110 et seq generally a planned unit development is a special zoning district category that provides an alternate approach to conventional land use controls the planned unit development may be used for particular tracts or parcels of land that are under common ownership and are to be developed as one unit according to a master development plan the planned unit development is subject to special review procedures once approved by the city council it becomes a special zoning classification for the property it represents  purpose and intent of article a it is the intent of this article to encourage unified design of residential commercial industrial or institutional areas and facilities or combinations thereof and to provide for integrated development having harmony of design and variety of function it is also the intent of this article to encourage the development of planned commercial and industrial sites to eliminate the adverse impacts of traditional strip zoning b the purpose of the planned unit development provisions is to 1 encourage innovative land development while maintaining appropriate limitations on the character and intensity of use ensuring compatibility with adjoining and proximate properties and following the guidelines of the comprehensive plan  2 permit flexibility within the development to maximize the unique physical features of the particular site  3 encourage efficient use of land facilitate economic arrangement of buildings and circulation systems and encourage diversified living environments and land uses  4 achieve a continuity of function and design within the development  5 encourage innovative development of smaller parcels of land that have been passed over  and 6 provide a vehicle for negotiating modifications in standard development requirements in order to both encourage innovative development and protect the health safety and welfare of the community  establishment of district  minimum area  master plan a planned unit development may be authorized by an amendment to the official zoning district map after public hearings by the planning commission and city council a planned unit development shall be considered a special zoning district and it may be authorized for any use or combination of uses permitted in this chapter a planned unit development must comply with the following requirements 1 minimum district area a planned unit development zoning district shall have a minimum area of not less than one acre or the minimum area requirement of the zoning district which the planned unit development is based upon whichever is greater 2 master plan a planned unit development master plan is required as the basis for review and approval of a planned unit development application the planned unit development master plan shall be adopted as a part of the ordinance of rezoning and shall be in conformance with the requirements of this chapter and the following a the planned unit development master plan shall consist of two elements the design statement and the master development plan map  b the planned unit development master plan shall establish residential densities as well as amount type and general location of all land uses  and c the planned unit development master plan shall serve as the basis for review and approval of all subdivision plats and building permits within the planned unit development  effect of approval a approval of a zoning change to planned unit development adopts the master plan prepared by the applicant and reviewed as a part of the application the master plan establishes new and specific requirements for amount and type of land use residential densities development regulations and location of specific elements of the development such as open space landscaping and screening b the planned unit development classification replaces any previous zoning district classification on a parcel c where there is no provision in the planned unit development master plan for special development regulations the requirements of the most restrictive conventional zoning district in which a proposed use or a structure is permitted shall be applied to the development  criteria for review and approval a because the planned unit development provides the opportunity for higher densities greater design flexibility mixed land uses and improved marketability the applicant should be prepared to provide amenities and services that might not be required or possible in a conventional development review and approval of a planned unit development is therefore a process of negotiation between the city government and the applicant to achieve the intents and purposes of this chapter and the comprehensive plan the following factors should be specifically included as review criteria for the evaluation of a planned unit development application other factors not listed in this section may also be considered in the review process in order to respond to specific design and land use proposals b the following design standards should be specifically included as review criteria for the evaluation of a planned unit development application 1 general development standards the proposed planned unit development should be designed to provide for the unified development of the area in accordance with the spirit and purpose of the comprehensive plan and the land uses and zoning districts adjacent to it 2 modification of zoning requirements design of the planned unit development may provide for modification of conventional zoning ordinance requirements for such elements as yard areas densities setback and height on individual lots in accordance with the planned unit development master plan 3 conformance with master plan and comprehensive plan density land use and intensity of use requirements should be based on the planned unit development master plan and should be reviewed carefully for conformance to the comprehensive plan 4 conformance with building code building code requirements should not be reduced or modified in the design of a planned unit development 5 gross density the maximum number of dwelling units within a planned unit development should be based on calculation of gross density gross density should be established in the planned unit development master plan and should be calculated by dividing the total land area to be developed for residential uses exclusive of arterial streets by the number of dwelling units 6 housing type and location location and type of housing should be established in a general pattern and shown on the master development plan map 7 park dedication parking facilities and landscaping park dedication requirements chapter 106 article vi parking requirements article x of this chapter and landscaping requirements article ix division 2 of this chapter should not be reduced in the design of a planned unit development 8 intensity proposed development should conform to the level of intensity guidelines in the comprehensive plan and should be developed in a manner and at a scale that will be compatible with adjacent developed neighborhoods 9 amenities amenities should be considered as an important justification for development and city approval of a planned unit development where gross or net densities are to be increased to promote economy of development or where other methods of land use intensification are proposed usable open space should be furnished along with provisions for its permanent retention and continued maintenance sidewalks and pedestrian ways shall be planned where it is necessary to provide for amenity and public safety 10 minimum land area and frontage the minimum area and frontage for a planned unit development request involving office commercial or industrial land uses should generally be at least the minimum required by the conventional zoning associated with the proposal 11 streets the following are general design standards for streets a street design should be innovative and should restrict from residential areas as much as possible b encouragement should be given to design of short local streets serving limited areas such as the residential culdesac c development of a private street system should be considered appropriate under certain conditions where there is no however a private street system should not serve as a reason for reduction of minimum design and paving standards in urban areas d onstreet parking bays or other similar areas should not be approved 12 adjacent land uses the following general guidelines should be used to establish the relationship of the planned unit development to abutting land uses a the master development plan map shall show graphically the treatments that will be employed to separate the planned unit development from abutting properties including commitments to landscaping screening earth berms or similar techniques b it is appropriate to specifically establish areas with height limitations where a transition to more intense uses is proposed or where a higher intensity development is proposed to abut a lower intensity area 13 mixed land use developments where a planned unit development proposes a mix of uses which would generally be incompatible with a conventional development the planned unit development master plan should specifically establish appropriate guidelines to ensure a harmonious development 14 common access in commercial or industrial developments the planned unit development master plan should establish specific standards and locations for common access driveways both within the development and abutting arterial streets c streets and alleys
