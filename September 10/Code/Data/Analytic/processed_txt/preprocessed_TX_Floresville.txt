minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public 4 minimize prolonged business interruptions 5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains 6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area 03       methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction 3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters 4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other

intent of this chapter the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter section 15103 h variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result i variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure j prerequisites for granting variances 1 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief 2 variances shall only be issued upon a showing a good and sufficient cause  b a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and c a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense
