fifteen  fire prevention part seventeen  housing s note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position   enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number

dimensions for conditional uses in residential districts 114506schedule of minimum lot and yard dimensions for conditional uses in commercial and industrial districts 114507supplemental regulations for certain uses  114501 purpose aconditional uses are a classification of uses that are determined to generally be compatible in the district in which they are listed as a conditional use however this category of uses is so classified because of the need to adequately monitor the proposed use in order to ensure that the use and its operational aspects are indeed appropriate in the specific location in which the use is proposed such monitoring is necessary because the external impacts of a particular use are either sufficiently varied or indeterminable in advance and therefore may vary from site to site making it possible that without the planning commissions review a particular use could be inappropriate in a certain location within the district bthese regulations are intended to ensure that conditional uses are reviewed in a reasonable and equitable manner while safeguarding the property rights of all individuals and the health safety and general welfare of the community toward these ends it is recognized that this provide for more detailed evaluation of each use listed as a conditional use in a specific district with respect to such considerations as location design size methods of operation intensity of use requirements for public facilities and traffic generation in considering a proposed conditional use the planning commission may assign reasonable requirements to ensure that the proposed development is appropriate in the location in which it is proposed accordingly conditional use permits shall conform to the procedures and requirements of 02 general criteria for all conditional uses a conditional use and uses accessory to such conditional use shall be permitted in a district only when specified as a conditional use in such district and only if such use conforms to the following general criteria which are in addition to specific conditions standards and regulations set forth in the planning commission shall review the particular facts and circumstances of each proposed use in terms of the following criteria and shall find adequate evidence that the use as proposed awill be designed constructed operated and maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended character of the general vicinity and that such use will not essentially change the character of the same area  bwill not be detrimental to property values in the immediate vicinity cwill not restrict or adversely affect the existing use of the adjacent property owners dwill be designed and constructed so that all access drives access points to public streets driveways parking and service areas shall be in compliance with the regulations set forth in ewill meet the requirements of epa for stormwater runoff when applicable fwill be properly landscaped in accordance with gthe establishment maintenance or operation of the conditional use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health safety or general welfare  hthe hours of operation of the proposed use are similar to a use permitted in the district ithe establishment of the conditional use in the proposed location will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the district  jadequate utilities access roads drainage andor necessary facilities have been or are being provided  kadequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress designed to minimize traffic congestion on the surrounding public streets  lthe establishment of the conditional use should not be detrimental to the economic welfare of the community by creating excessive additional requirements at public cost for public facilities such as police fire and schools  mthere is minimal potential for future hardship on the conditional use that could result from the proposed use being surrounded by uses permitted by right that may be incompatible 114503 specific standards for
