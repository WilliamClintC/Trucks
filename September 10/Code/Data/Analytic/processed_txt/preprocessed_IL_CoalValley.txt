susceptible to erosion and if left unprotected could cause severe loss of soil with resultant damage to property  b the topography of the village contains areas with steep slopes upon which if clearing of trees andor inappropriate construction takes place could result in severe erosion and slope stability problems which could result in damage to property  c excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses including but not limited to the construction of dwelling units commercial buildings and industrial plants the building of roads and highways the modification of stream channels and drainage ways and the creation of recreational facilities  d the washing blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles  e soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies washed out fills and embankments  f sediment from soil erosion clogs drainage systems and pollutes rivers streams lakes wetlands and reservoirs  g sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds destroys 61 fish and other desirable aquatic life and is costly and difficult to remove  and h sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage capacity of flood plains and natural depressions resulting in increased chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety general principles it is the objective of this ordinance to control soil erosion and sedimentation caused by development activities including clearing grading stripping excavating and filling of land in the village measures taken to control soil
