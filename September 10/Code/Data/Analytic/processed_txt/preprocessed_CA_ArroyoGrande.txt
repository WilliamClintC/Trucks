take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying

neighbor policy between agriculturalists and residents by advising purchasers and residents of property adjacent to or near agricultural operations of the inherent potential problems associated with such purchase or residence including but not limited to the sounds odors dust and chemicals that may accompany agricultural operations so that such purchasers and residents will understand the inconveniences that accompany living side by side to agriculture and be prepared to accept such problems as the natural result of living in or near agricultural areas it is the intent of the city council that no agricultural activity operation or facility or appurtenances thereof conducted or maintained for commercial purposes and in a manner consistent with proper and accepted customs and

purpose and intent it is the purpose of this section to promote the public health safety and general welfare to safeguard important environmental and sensitive biological resources contributing to healthy functioning ecosystem and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damages  7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  8 ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  9 implement general plan policies to enhance natural creek functions and values by providing erosion control sedimentation prevention enhancement of riparian habitat corridors water quality protection and aesthetic and recreational opportunities c methods of reducing flood losses and providing creek protection in order to accomplish its purposes this section includes the following methods and provisions 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels riparian habitat and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or degrade riparian habitat  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers or incremental floodplain constriction which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas  6 creeks shall remain in their natural state and shall not be altered unless approved by the city council in conjunction with an application for a

provisions of subsection f of this section h variances and appeals 1 the planning commission of the city shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this section 2 the planning commission shall hear and decide appeals regarding any decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this section may be appealed to the city council 3 the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this section would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 4 review of variance requests in passing upon requests for creek setback or flood managementrelated variances the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other subsections of this section and a potential impacts to cultural biological and hydrological resources have been adequately mitigated based on consideration of a phase i archeological study a biology report and a hydrogeomorphologist report  b danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  c danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  d susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  e importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  f necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  g availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  h compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  i relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  j safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  k expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and l costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges 5 conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of subsection e and f of this section have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this section for example in the case of variances to elevation requirement this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances shall only be issued upon a i showing of good and sufficient cause  ii determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and iii determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance cause fraud or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances hardship as used in this subsection means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance the hardship must be exceptional unusual and peculiar to the property involved economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional inconvenience aesthetic considerations physical handicaps personal preferences or the disapproval of ones neighbors likewise cannot as a rule qualify as an exceptional hardship public safety and nuisance as used in this subsection means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood or any considerable number of persons or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use in the customary manner of any navigable lake or river bay stream canal or basin fraud and victimization as used in this subsection means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public in examining this requirement the city will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty 50 to one hundred 100 years buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs inconvenience danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring in addition future owners may purchase the property unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsection g5a e of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance g upon consideration of the factors of subsection g4 of this section and the purposes of this section the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this section 6 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level can result in substantially increased premium rates for flood insurance as determined by their insurance carrier  b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property 7 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency i findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city of arroyo grande are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses  exh a part 2007 prior code  9  4 9252012   3 6252013   4112017 general development standards   purpose and intent the purpose and intent of general
