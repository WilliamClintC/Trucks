recurring flooding that such flooding damages and endangers life and public and private property and facilities that this condition is aggravated by developments and encroachments in the floodplain and that the most appropriate method of alleviating such condition is of such developments and encroachments it is therefore determined that the special and paramount public interest in the floodplain justifies the regulation of property located therein as provided in this section which is in the exercise of the police power of the municipality for the protection of the persons and property of its

only those uses which can be appropriately located in the floodplain as herein defined and which will not impede the flow or storage of floodwaters or otherwise cause danger to life and property at above or below their locations along the floodplains e to provide sufficient drainage courses to carry abnormal flows or stormwater in periods of heavy precipitation f to protect adjacent landowners and those both upstream and downstream from damages resulting from development within a floodplain and the consequent obstruction or increase in flow of floodwaters g to protect the entire city from individual uses of land which may have an effect upon subsequent expenditures for public works and disaster relief and adversely affect the economic wellbeing of the city  221 foreword  230 fwd717 h to protect other municipalities within the same watershed from the impact of improper development and the consequent increased potential for flooding i to provide areas for the temporary natural

major consideration for the land use in question studies and interviews at similar land uses must be conducted or referenced g rate sums any significant difference between the sums of singleuse rates and proposed mixuse estimates must be justified in the study report h explanations required the reasoning and data used in developing a trip generation rate for specialunusual generators must be justified and explained in the report i definition of influence area 1 prior to trip distribution of sitegenerated trips an influence area must be defined which contains 80% or more of the trip ends that will be attracted to the development a market study can be used to establish the limits of an influence area if available if no market study is available an influence area should be estimated based on a reasonable documented estimate the influence area can also be based on a reasonable maximum convenient travel time to the site or delineating area boundaries based on locations of competing developments 2 other methods such as using trip data from an existing development with similar characteristics or using an existing origindestination survey of trips within the area can be used in place of the influence area to delineate the boundaries of the impact j estimates of trip distribution required 1 trip distribution can be estimated using any one of the following three methods a analogy b trip distribution model c surrogate data  320 foreword  320 fwd785 2 whichever method is used trip distribution must be estimated and analyzed for the horizon year a multiuse development may require more than one distribution and coinciding assignment for each phase for example residential and retail phases on the same site consideration must also be given to whether inbound and outbound trips will have similar distributions k trip assignments 1 assignments must be made considering logical routings available roadway capacities left turns at critical intersections and projected and perceived minimum travel times in addition multiple paths should often be assigned between origins and destinations to achieve realistic estimates rather than assigning all of the trips to the route with the shortest travel time the assignments must be carried external site access points and in large projects those producing 500 or more additional peak direction trips to or from the site during the developments peak hour internal roadways when the site has more than one access driveway logical routing and possibly multiple paths should be used to obtain realistic driveway volumes the assignment should reflect conditions at the time of the analysis assignments can be accomplished either manually or with applicable computer models 2 if a thorough analysis is required to account for passby trips the following procedure should be used a determine the percentage of passby trips in the total trips generated b estimate a trip distribution for the passby trips c perform two separate trip assignments based on the new and passby trip distributions d combine the passby and new trip assignment 3 upon completion of the initial site traffic assignment the results should be reviewed to see if the volumes appear logical given characteristics of the road system and trip distribution adjustments should be made if the initial results do not appear to be logical or reasonable l total traffic impacts traffic estimates for any site with current traffic activity must reflect not only new traffic associated with the sites redevelopment but also the trips subtracted from the traffic stream because of the removal of a land use the traffic impact report should clearly depict the traffic estimate and its components  320 saint marys code  320 fwd786 m capacity analysis 1 capacity analysis must be performed at each of the major street and project site access intersection locations signalized and unsignalized within the study area in addition analyses must be completed for roadway segments deemed sensitive to site traffic within the study area these may include such segments as weaving sections ramps internal site roadways parking facility access points and reservoirs for vehicles queuing off site and on site other locations may be deemed appropriate depending on the situation 2 the recommended levelofservice analysis procedures detailed in the most recent edition
