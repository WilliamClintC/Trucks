areas of the city of spartanburg are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare furthermore these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages b statement of purpose and objectives it is the purpose of this ordinance to protect human life and health minimize property damage and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion are restricted or prohibited these provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion additionally the ordinance prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands the objectives of this ordinance are to protect human life and health to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area the provisions of the ordinance are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in the floodplain and prolonged business interruptions also an important floodplain management objective of this ordinance is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding floodplains are an important asset to the community they perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters moderation of peak flood flows maintenance of water quality groundwater recharge prevention of erosion habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality these functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state wherever possible the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced decisions to alter floodplains especially floodways and stream channels should be the result of careful planning processes which evaluate resource conditions and human needs  amended by council  general and

please refer to to review the urban riparian buffer overlay district  1 intent and purpose the city council of spartanburg south carolina finds that the protection of the streams and water bodies of the city of spartanburg is vital to the health safety and economic welfare of its citizens streams with natural vegetation maintained along their banks in the form of a riparian buffer reduce the negative effects of erosion and sedimentation on properties within the city and further downstream riparian buffers also trap and remove harmful contaminants before they enter streams thus protecting the water quality of streams within the city of spartanburg riparian buffers add to the aesthetic enjoyment of streams within the city to the overall appearance of the city and to the property values of properties within the city it is the intent of this ordinance to ensure that streams within the city are protected by riparian buffers note a riparian buffer is the simplest and most cost effective way of reducing the negative effects of storm water runoff on the streams and water bodies within the city of spartanburg and consequently the negative effect on properties along these streams a riparian buffer functions by leaving existing vegetation along existing streams the existing trees shrubs and groundcover reduce the harmful effect of erosion and trap and remove pollutants before they enter streams riparian buffers protect the water quality of streams within the city add to the appearance of the city and help maintain property values for properties along the streams and water bodies riparian buffers protect a valuable resource and also reserve open space that can allow for the development of future greenways trails and recreational space for the citizens of the city this the following it provides for the protection of existing plant buffers along the streams and water bodies within the city of spartanburg  it provides a standard the revegetation standard for replanting along streams in order to achieve effective plant buffers where action the existing buffer is removed and a violation results  and it provides for the preservation or creation of open space that may form the basis for the creation of trails or other recreational uses of benefit to the citizens of the city 2 definitions note the following definitions apply specifically to the administration of this definitions define important concepts used in this such as the revegetation standard which is the amount and type of vegetation approximating the natural buffer found along streams in this area streams means the following identified streams within the corporate limits of the city of spartanburg lawsons fork creek  fairforest creek  named tributaries to the above two

the property note the riparian buffer district is an overlay zoning district which means that its requirements overlay add to the existing requirements of the zoning any piece of property to which it applies the map in figure 1 above shows the properties affected by the riparian buffer district all other requirements of the zoning in effect for these properties in addition to the requirements of the riparian buffer district the following land uses are prohibited within the protected area a any landdisturbing activity  b septic tanks and septic tank drain fields  c buildings accessory

property owners to utilize their properties for the uses permitted under the zoning meeting the intent of the riparian buffer district two types of variances are permitted a minor variance may be approved administratively and permits some flexibility in the width of the buffer so long as the amount of area covered by the buffer remains the same a major variance requires approval by the board of zoning appeals and deals with those situations where there is a legitimate hardship for the property owner based on unique characteristics of the individual site this for two types of variances minor variances which are a reduction in buffer width of up to 25% over a portion of the property in exchange for an increase in buffer width elsewhere on the same property  and major variances which are a reduction in buffer width that is not balanced by a corresponding increase in width a minor variances are a reduction in buffer width over a portion of the property in exchange for an increase in buffer width elsewhere on the same property such that the average buffer width remains the required width no minor variance can decrease width by less than 25% of the required width at any point minor variances may be approved administratively by filing an application with the office of community enhancement planning and zoning division if reductions in the width of the riparian buffer on a property are balanced by corresponding increases in the riparian buffer elsewhere on the same property such that the total area included in the riparian buffer for that property is the same as if it were the full width across its entire length general and supplemental regulations please note that any reference to the previous zone of b2central business district was amended by council  and changed

of community enhancement planning and zoning division to be heard by the board of zoning appeals bza subject to the filing and scheduling procedures for variances 1 each applicant for a major variance must provide as part of the application for the variance the following a existing features map that meets the requirements of site plan review of the zoning   b justification for seeking the variance

the property as of the effective date of the ordinance is such that it is not possible to construct a single family dwelling without encroaching upon the riparian buffer 3 a major variance may be granted subject to a finding by the board of zoning appeals that a the width of the riparian buffer is reduced only by the minimum extent necessary to provide relief  and b all landdisturbing activities must comply with the requirements of the city of spartanburg standards for stormwater management and sediment reduction and all applicable best management practices such activities shall not impair water quality as defined by the federal clean water act and the requirements of the south carolina department of health and environmental control dhec  and c as a further condition of

ordinance has been prepared as a new district within the context of the existing zoning ordinance with three subdistricts or zones further defining the area these districts have been established using the transect as the fundamental organizing tool the transect is a method of classifying the natural and built environment as a continuum of six conditions ranging from rural to urban the value of the transect is that it serves to locate any given place within a context in which all of the parts fit together harmoniously the diagram below illustrates these conditions as they would apply to the entire city with environmentally areas that are permanently preserved for natural areas and the downtown that is supported first and foremost for human habitat1 for example a rural street typically has no curbs or sidewalks and its buildings look like farmhouses or barns an urban street depending on the intensity of urbanism may have curbs and gutters regularly placed street trees sidewalks and building forms that include common walls flat roofs and cornices each transect zoning category has detailed provisions for each neighborhood for density height street design public space design mix of uses building design parking and other aspects of the human environment for the purposes of this ordinance only the most urban zones the t4 the t5 and t6 were incorporated for use they are noted on the regulating plan and zoning map as being subdistricts of the downtown d district these zones can be best characterized as follows dt4 the urban neighborhoods that surround or are integral to the downtown area dt5 the gateway corridors and blocks surrounding the downtown core dt6 the core of the downtown area with the highest level of pedestrian activity and urbanism 1 at this time the above

will be required to submit the leed scorecard leed version 22 or the most recent update along with the site plan application the leed scorecard will be accompanied by an explanation of how andor why each credit can or cannot be achieved the leed scorecard is a checklist of green building standards and allows the developer to voluntarily score the building against the leed green building rating system the scorecard is the documentation supporting the developers request for bonus height the scorecard is used to select which credits the developer intends to pursue and the number of points earned determines the award level 2 the building registration and other required information will be filed with usgbc at the beginning of the project for leed certification and rating by the developer 3 the proposed site plan including the requested bonus height will undergo the typical review process the city and the developer will enter into a development agreement requiring that the green building components identified in the scorecard be constructed or installed in the building and that any thirdparty inspection fees will be paid for by the developer 4 once the site plan is approved permit drawings will be reviewed to ensure inclusion of the approved green building components which were previously identified in the scorecard the city will utilize thirdparty leedcertified inspectors or architects hired by the developer during review of the permit drawings and construction of the building permits will not be issued unless approved leed components are included in the plan drawings 5 at the time of permit application the owner must post a performance bond in a form acceptable to the city of spartanburg the amount of the required performance bond must be calculated

four percent 4% of the total cost of construction for any building greater than 200000 square feet 6 the application for leed certification and rating will be submitted to usgbc when the building construction is complete or substantially complete depending on the credits elected if during construction of the building the developer is unable to include all of the approved green building components previously identified in the scorecard the developer will be required to replace components not provided with other green building components acceptable to usgbc and the leed rating system downtown code  spartanburg sc 328  revision date 11122010  amended  added downtown to city zoning 2412 7 during plan review and construction the leedcertified inspector or architect will provide documentation and submit regular reports to the city ensuring compliance or at least flag problems early on with the leed standards and scorecard and the approved site plan if during construction the developer is unable to include required green building components or if the inspectorarchitect finds that the developer failed to include these components then the city will pursue enforcement 8 the certificate of occupancy will be issued when the building is leed certified at the agreed upon level or better by usgbc and construction is consistent with the approved site plan certification by usgbc will be obtained when the building is complete and the developer has constructed or installed the approved green building components previously identified the performance bond must be forfeited to the city in the event that the building does not meet the verification requirements for leed the city will draw down on the bond funds if leed certification has not been achieved and accepted by the city within one year of the city issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the building 9 funds that become available to the city from the forfeiture of the performance bond must be placed in a

medley of districts in the zoning on the zoning map to that end the downtown area should be zoned in a manner that is both consistent with the downtown plan but permits some flexibility in varying the ideas set forth in it users of this document will notice that this downtown been ordered in a manner that addresses the standards for the most public realm the street to the most private realm the building as a design becomes more detailed and moves from the subdivision plan to the site plan to the building elevation users are encouraged to progress document the guiding principle of this downtown that the use of the property while important is subordinate to the design of the building within which it is contained this encourages visual compatibility while permitting mixed uses in close proximity to each another 5151 purpose & intent the purpose of this code is to implement the vision and goals of the downtown master plan these regulations are designed to permit the development and redevelopment of the central business district and its immediate surroundings the intent is to accommodate mixeduse pedestrianfriendly buildings and public spaces in the downtown that over time will evolve into areas allowing people to live work shop gather worship and other public events this code attaches the same or greater level of importance to the overall building design as is placed on the uses within the building to create a convenient and attractive community buildings added to downtown should contribute to the longterm architectural vibrancy of the community to encourage economic development activities that enlarge the tax base and by providing desirable residences and places of shopping employment and public assembly this code encourages the placement of buildings closer to each other as well as closer to the street where pedestrian activity is expected to occur as the sidewalks remain the principal place of pedestrian movement and casual social interaction designs and uses should be complementary of that function the desired result is a reduction in traffic congestion and an overall improvement in the quality of life there are five core principle which guide these standards and serve as the essential guidelines for the review of all applications a connectivity downtown spartanburg has a generally welldefined street grid pattern  however not every street accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists in truth only main street provides a clearly defined pedestrian realm  all other streets are heavily weighted towards the automobile the downtown plan suggests that each street should provide greater balance between pedestrian and vehicular modes of travel in fact the desired balance should favor the needs of the pedestrian in an effort to create an environment that encourages walking in the downtown there are two fundamental elements for a satisfactory pedestrian environment  the destination and the journey while there are many destinations throughout the downtown they are not always clustered nor downtown code spartanburg sc 3 are they always convenient depending on the origin of the trip the best way to manage and encourage the journey between destinations is to improve streetscapes and create more interesting storefronts and building facades the plan proposes improved streetscapes with wider sidewalks and landscaping along the primary pedestrian corridors church street converse street liberty street east main street broad street kennedy street it also incorporates new bicycle routes connecting the regional trail network with various recreation destinations and the colleges it encourages ground level serviceretailrestaurants along certain streets to provide an interesting trip that draws the pedestrian from one place to the next finally the plan recommends a conversion of broad street from a wide 5 lane street to a street with onstreet parking similar to dunbar street with these improvements downtown spartanburg will achieve an urban atmosphere that is comfortable and welcoming b housing a great downtown is made up of great diverse neighborhoods more housing equals more people more people equals more potential customers and clients for retail and restaurants the daytime population of office workers while significant is not sufficient to support these shops and services long term  they depend on a 1218 hour environment for success there are three principal components to ensure a successful housing market bring back the middle class based on the demographic analysis there is a disproportionately small middleclass within the city limits the middleclass represents the stable socioeconomic base from which retail sales are generated highqualified employees are found and new businesses are formed the success of regenerating neighborhoods like hampton heights with new and renovated housing should be supported and expanded high quality affordable housing fragile or threatened neighborhoods such as the spartan mills neighborhood must be restabilized new neighborhoods should be mixedincome and the architecture and site planning held to the same high standards as every other neighborhood the most successful affordable units should be virtually indistinguishable from market rate units urban housing new urbanscaled housing immediately adjacent to downtown as well as in the upper floors of new buildings should be actively pursued housing that is urban recognizes that density and design can promote a vibrant pedestrian environment new building types such as narrow lot detached homes brownstones flats condominiums and livework units should be introduced around main street c mixeduse infill & redevelopment great downtowns are built in finegrained increments the megaproject rarely saves a downtown and is very difficult  financially and politically  to achieve in truth the largest scale projects that might be achievable for a city like spartanburg have already occurred  the dennys tower the marriott hotel and the chapman cultural center the focus now must be on filling in the numerous smallscale gaps with highlydetailed mixeduse buildings that enliven the sidewalks with ground level activity such as shops and restaurants and provide opportunities for employment and housing on the upper floors d downtown should be urban what makes downtowns different than the shopping mall in short it is the urbanism of the downtown  the variety of opportunities for social interaction  that make downtowns desirable locations this downtown code spartanburg sc 4 philosophy is as old as spartanburg itself from sales day in 1888 to jazz on the square in 2007 spartanburg was built on a premise of providing public spaces that every citizen can use as an urban environment the downtown should be pedestrianfriendly and mixeduse new buildings should be judged not only by their tax value but also by whether they provide streetlevel activity buildings should be built to the sidewalk and have entries accessible to the public with lots of windows and detailing storefront bays should be constructed in increments as small as possible  main street was built with facades that are less than 50 feet in width downtown should have an urban not a suburban feel surface parking should be avoided in favor of parking structures onstreet parking should be provided on every street possible street trees and landscaping should accent the storefronts not obscure them lighting at night should come from display windows first then pedestrian scaled fixtures and finally by street lights if necessary finally downtown should be recognized as a neighborhood  but unlike suburbia it will be a little messy messy does not mean unsafe or dirty  rather it indicates that many different types of people walk on the streets garbage will be collected early in the morning and the occasional event will make noise not every residential unit will have an attached garage and most parking for a shop will be in a place other than directly in front of the store this is what it means to be a city e put people first great downtowns follow one golden rule they put people first pedestrians have the upper hand in the transportation system with wide sidewalks crosswalks and priority with traffic signals pedestrians are entertained along their journey with storefronts display windows and active uses such as retail and restaurants on the ground floors additionally they are provided benches to rest places to relax and plazas squares and parks to recreate the image to the right illustrates the distances and travel times that the average adult can walk to main street students from wofford college and converse college can walk to morgan square in about 15 minutes even the far reaches of the study area are only a twenty minute walk from the heart of downtown the ability to make spartanburg a walking and biking community is well within reach if circulation systems sensitive to the needs of pedestrians and bicyclists are considered the relationship to pedestrians should be the fundamental test for every new building every road improvement and every street tree this evaluation should begin where the pedestrian begins  in the neighborhoods the college campuses and the parking decks is the route safe direct and enjoyable downtown code spartanburg sc 5 5152 administration 21 general compliance  approval process to encourage compliance with the standards of this downtown well as the vision and goals of the downtown master plan for spartanburg all site plans and building design plans will be

architecture construction downtown code spartanburg sc 8 5153 district provisions this ordinance has been prepared as a new district within the context of the existing zoning ordinance with three subdistricts or zones further defining the area these districts have been established using the transect as the fundamental organizing tool the transect is a method of classifying the natural and built environment as a continuum of six conditions ranging from rural to urban the value of the transect is that it serves to locate any given place within a context in which all of the parts fit together harmoniously the diagram below illustrates these conditions as they would apply to the entire city with environmentally areas that are permanently preserved for natural areas and the downtown that is supported first and foremost for human habitat for example a rural street typically has no curbs or sidewalks and its buildings look like farmhouses or barns an urban street depending on the intensity of urbanism may have curbs and gutters regularly placed street trees sidewalks and building forms that include common walls flat roofs and cornices each transect zoning category has detailed provisions for each neighborhood for density height street design public space design mix of uses building design parking and other aspects of the human environment for the purposes of this ordinance only the most urban zones the t4 the t5 and t6 were incorporated for use they are noted on the regulating plan and zoning map as being subdistricts of the downtown d district these zones can be best characterized as follows dt3 the predominately detached residential neighborhoods that surround the downtown dt4 the more urban neighborhoods that are predominately residential but include some mixeduse dt5 the gateway corridors and blocks surrounding the downtown core dt6 the core of the downtown area with the highest level of pedestrian activity and urbanism graphic by duany platerzyberk and company downtown districts downtown code spartanburg sc 9 31 interpretation of use matrices  any use not listed in the use matrix is prohibited unless the planning director determines that it falls within the same class as a listed use as set forth below should the planning director determine that a materially similar use does exist the regulations governing that use shall apply to the particular use not listed and the planning directors decision shall be recorded in writing should the planning director determine that a materially similar use does not exist this be amended to establish a specific listing for the use in question  the planning director may determine that a use is materially similar if a the proposed use shall not generate average daily trips exceeding other similar uses proposed in the zoning district by more than ten percent 10% as determined by the institute of transportation engineers trip generation manual latest edition which document is hereby incorporated by this reference if the trip generation is not listed in the trip generation manual then the use shall be considered materially similar to the use that most closely approximates the proposed use the planning director may also refer to similar local traffic studies b the planning director may also use one or more of the following criteria to determine material similarity  the actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each use category   the relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity   relative amounts of sales from each activity   the customer type for each activity   the relative number of employees in each activity   hours of operation   building and site arrangement

plan application the leed scorecard will be accompanied by an explanation of how andor why each credit can or cannot be achieved the leed scorecard is a checklist of green building standards and allows the developer to voluntarily score the building against the leed green building rating system the scorecard is the documentation supporting the developers request for bonus height the scorecard is used to select which credits the developer intends to pursue and the number of points earned determines the award level 2 the building registration and other required information will be filed with usgbc at the beginning of the project for leed certification and rating by the developer 3 the proposed site plan including the requested bonus height will undergo the typical review process the city and the developer will enter into a development agreement requiring that the green building components identified in the scorecard be constructed or installed in the building and that any thirdparty inspection fees will be paid for by the developer 4 once the site plan is approved permit drawings will be reviewed to ensure inclusion of the approved green building components which were previously identified in the scorecard the city will utilize thirdparty leedcertified inspectors or architects hired by the developer during review of the permit drawings and construction of the building permits will not be issued unless approved leed components are included in the plan drawings 5 at the time of permit application the owner must post a performance bond in a form acceptable to the city of

sc 22 6 the application for leed certification and rating will be submitted to usgbc when the building construction is complete or substantially complete depending on the credits elected if during construction of the building the developer is unable to include all of the approved green building components previously identified in the scorecard the developer will be required to replace components not provided with other green building components acceptable to usgbc and the leed rating system 7 during plan review and construction the leedcertified inspector or architect will provide documentation and submit regular reports to the city ensuring compliance or at least flag problems early on with the leed standards and scorecard and the approved site plan if during construction the developer is unable to include required green building components or if the inspectorarchitect finds that the developer failed to include these components then the city will pursue enforcement 8 the certificate of occupancy will be issued when the building is leed certified at the agreed upon level or better by usgbc and construction is consistent with the approved site plan certification by usgbc will be obtained when the building is complete and the developer has constructed or installed the approved green building components previously identified the performance bond must be forfeited to the city in the event that the building does not meet the verification requirements for leed the city will draw down on the bond funds if leed certification has not been achieved and accepted by the city within one year of the city issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the building 9 funds that become available to the city from the forfeiture of the performance bond must be placed in a

interesting and attractive b streets should accommodate many users safely and comfortably with priority given to the pedestrian and the cyclist c new development should not create physical or visual gaps along the street frontage and should fill in existing gaps to the greatest extent possible with interesting and active frontages  key principle housing a housing is strongly encouraged throughout the downtown in general housing should be located on upper stories b housing should not be placed on the ground floor frontage in dt6 and along main street  key principle mixeduse infill & redevelopment a great downtowns are built using finegrained increments avoid large scale buildings where possible b buildings should be designed to grow and adapt over time the accommodation of mixeduses whether at the time of initial occupancy or over the longterm is strongly preferred to singleuse structures c to compliment the historic fabric of the downtown area new buildings substantial renovations and expansions should be of the highest design quality and should be considered longterm additions to the downtown fabric  key principle downtown should be urban a buildings should generally be simple in form but welldetailed b facades should be designed to recognize the interior spaces of the occupants in an authentic manner avoid the technique of visually contriving multiple facades along a single frontage unless there is a clear break in building c avoid elaborate changes in materials configurations and vertical and horizontal elements that are designed to create interest from long distances or in vehicles because downtown buildings are most often experienced pedestrians and not from a highspeed automobile design elements should be scaled as such d storefront bays should be constructed in increments as small as possible  preferably in widths that are 50 feet or less e surface parking in dt5 and dt6 is strongly discouraged in favor of structured parking f any such surface parking if provided should be in the rear if permitted by the design review board to be placed in the side yard it should be considered temporary designed to accommodate future
