findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented business  state of minnesota the council finds 1 2 3 4 5 6 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this article as adult theaters and adult cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses at

transmitted contact intravenous drub abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films the findings noted in subsections b1 14 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented businesses is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein removal of doors to adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article   i 4112005 deinitions the

hazard areas of the city of maplewood missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials for st louis county dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto

business district intent and purpose a b c the ab district is intended to accommodate and regulate those business and commercial uses which draw customers primarily from motorists passing on the street or for whom a location on a highway or arterial street is especially useful or necessary such uses function relatively independent of intensive pedestrian traffic and proximity of other businesses because they typically require direct access to automobile traffic and visibility from the street careful consideration must be given to their effect on the efficiency and safety or traffic movement as well as to their impact on adjacent areas and residences the uses permitted in this district consist primarily of ones which do not ordinarily seek locations in nucleated shopping centers and which therefore must be provided for at independent locations although some typical retail uses are permitted in the ab district most of the uses permitted do not blend well into other retail
