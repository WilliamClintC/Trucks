treatment facility is reduced lost or fails art xvi  1 1999   prohibited discharge standards a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either aa local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or bno local limit exists but the

interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements art xvi  2 1999   bypass afor the purposes of this section bypass the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any

permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production ba user may allow the bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are

and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the control authority may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours d1bypass is prohibited and the control authority may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless abypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  bthere were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and cthe user submitted notices as required under subsection c of this section 2the control authority may approve an anticipated bypass
