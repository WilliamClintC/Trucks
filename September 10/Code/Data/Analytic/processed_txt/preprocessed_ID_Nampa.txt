canyon county idaho finds that a based on the city of nampa comprehensive plan adopted by the city pursuant to chapter 65 title 67 idaho including but not limited to the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan and the general governmental goal of protecting the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city it is necessary that the citys public facilities for 1 parks and recreation 2 streets 3 police and 4 fireemergency medical services ems be expanded and improved to accommodate new development within the city throughout this chapter the system improvements for these four 4 types of public facilities are sometimes collectively referred to as the city capital facilities and sometimes individually referred to as a city capital improvements element b the city has formed the development impact fee advisory committee required by idaho that committee has performed the duties required of it pursuant to such statute the city intends that the committee continue to exist and to perform those duties identified in idaho that occur following the adoption of development impact fees c new residential and nonresidential development imposes and will impose increasing and excessive demands upon city capital facilities d the revenues generated from new residential and nonresidential development often do not generate sufficient funds to provide the necessary improvements of these city capital facilities to accommodate new development e new development is expected to continue and will place ever increasing demands on the city to provide and expand city capital facilities to serve new development f the city has planned for the improvement of the city capital facilities in the capital improvements element of the city of nampa comprehensive plan g title 67 of the idaho the idaho development impact fee act authorizes the city to adopt a development impact fee system to offset recoup or reimburse the portion of the costs of needed improvements to the city capital facilities caused by new development in the city h the creation of an equitable development impact fee system would promote the purposes set forth in the idaho development impact fee act in that it would 1 ensure that adequate public facilities are available to serve new growth and development  2 promote orderly growth and development by establishing uniform standards by which local governments may require that those who benefit from new growth and development pay a proportionate share of the cost of new public facilities needed to serve new growth and development  3 ensure that those who benefit from new growth and  sterling codifiers inc  54410 development are required to pay no more than their proportionate share of the cost of public facilities needed to serve new growth and development  and 4 prevent duplicate and ad hoc development requirements i the creation of an equitable development impact fee system would enable the city to accommodate new development and would assist the city to implement the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan  j in order to implement an equitable development impact fee system for the city capital facilities the city retained galena consulting to prepare an impact fee study for these types of facilities the resulting document is titled city of nampa idaho impact fee study and capital improvement plans dated  the development impact fee study and that document is hereby incorporated by reference eff 1012016 k the methodology used in preparing the development impact fee study when applied chapter complies with all applicable provisions of idaho law including those set forth in idaho statutes sections 6782042 67820416 67820423 678207 and 678209 the incorporation of the development impact fee study by reference satisfies the requirement in idaho statutes section 67820416 for a detailed description of the methodology by which the development impact fees were calculated and the requirement in idaho 24 for a description of acceptable levels of service for system improvements l the development impact fee study contains the capital improvements element of the city of nampa comprehensive plan and such element has been prepared in conformance with the requirements of chapters 65 and 82 of title 67 of the idaho the development impact fee study sets forth reasonable methodologies and analyses for determining the impacts of various types of new development on the city capital facilities and determines the cost of acquiring or constructing the improvements necessary to meet the demands for such facilities created by new development n in accordance with idaho the development impact fee study was based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs in addition the development impact fee study uses a fee calculation methodology that is net of credits for the present value of revenues that will be generated by new growth and development based on historical funding patterns and that are anticipated to be available to pay for system improvements including taxes assessments user fees and intergovernmental transfers o the development impact fees described in this chapter are based on the development impact fee study and do not exceed the costs of system improvements for city capital facilities to serve new development that will pay the development impact fees p the facilities for parks and recreation streets police and fireemergency medical services ems included in the calculation of fees in the development impact fee study will benefit all new residential and nonresidential development throughout the city and it is therefore appropriate to treat all areas of the city as a single service area for purposes of calculating collecting and spending the development impact fees collected from residential and nonresidential development q there is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between the development impacts created by each type of development covered by this chapter and the development impact fees that such development will be required to pay r this chapter creates a system by which development impact fees paid by new development will be used to finance defray or reimburse a portion of the costs incurred by the city to construct improvements for city capital facilities in ways that benefit the development for which each development impact fee was paid within a reasonable period of time after the development impact fee is paid and in conformance with idaho  s this chapter creates a system under which development impact fees shall not be used to correct existing deficiencies for any capital facilities or to replace or rehabilitate existing improvements or to pay for routine operation or maintenance of those facilities t this chapter creates a system under which there shall be no double payment of impact fees in accordance with idaho 19 u this chapter is consistent with all applicable provisions of chapter 82 title 67 idaho concerning development impact fee ordinances  372 authority and applicability a this chapter is enacted pursuant to the citys general police power the authority granted to the city pursuant to chapters 65 and 82 title 67 idaho other applicable laws of the state of idaho b this chapter shall apply to all areas of the city  373 intent a this chapter is adopted to be consistent with and to help implement the city of nampa comprehensive plan and particularly the capital improvements element of that plan  sterling codifiers inc  55410 b the intent of this chapter is to ensure that new development bears a proportionate share of the cost of improvements to city capital facilities  to ensure that such proportionate share does not exceed the cost of improvements to such facilities required to accommodate new development  and to ensure that funds collected from new development are actually used for improvements to city capital facilities that benefit such new development c it is the further intent of this chapter to be consistent with those principles for allocating a fair share of the cost of new capital facilities to new development and for adopting development impact fee ordinances established by chapter 82 title 67 of the idaho it is not the intent of this chapter to collect any money from any new development in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset new demands for city capital facilities created by such new development e it is not the intent of this chapter that any monies collected from any development impact fee deposited in an impact fee account ever be commingled with monies from a different impact fee account or ever be used for a development impact fee component different from that for which the fee was paid or ever be used to correct current deficiencies in the city capital facilities or ever be used to replace rehabilitate maintain or operate any

this section or b the city designates the proposed development as a development of extraordinary impact in writing to the fee payer in which case the provisions of subsection c5 of this section shall apply a any person who commences any new impact generating land development except those exempted pursuant to this chapter or those preparing an individual assessment pursuant to this chapter shall pay all development impact fees applicable to the proposed development as determined by the fee table persons choosing to pay applicable development impact fees pursuant to the fee table shall be deemed to have made a full and complete payment of the projects proportionate share of city capital facilities costs for system improvements except as noted in subsection 37 12i of this chapter b if the proposed development is of a type not listed in the fee table then the city shall apply the development impact fees applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use listed in the fee table the determination as to which type of development is most nearly comparable to the proposed development shall be made by referring to traffic generation rates for land uses published by the institute of transportation engineers and by identifying that land use listed in the fee table whose traffic generation rates are most comparable to the proposed land use if no traffic generation rate for the proposed land use appears in a publication of the institute of transportation engineers or if it is not possible to determine which land use listed in the fee table has the most comparable traffic generation rates then the most nearly comparable land use shall be determined by the development impact fee administrator based on comparison of other characteristics of the proposed land use including employment or occupancy the size of the facility and the amount of parking to be provided with the characteristics of those land uses listed in the fee table c if the proposed development includes a mix of those uses listed in the fee table then the development impact fees shall be determined by adding up the development impact fees that would be payable for each use as if it were a

impact fee administrator or a designee and may be accepted rejected or accepted with modifications by the development impact fee administrator or a designee as the basis for calculating development impact fees the criteria for acceptance rejection or acceptance with modifications shall be whether the individual assessment is a more accurate measure of demand for the city capital improvements elements created by the proposed development or the costs of those facilities than the applicable fee shown in the fee table e the decision by the development impact fee administrator or designee on an application for an individual assessment shall include an explanation of the calculation of the impact fee shall specify the system improvements for which the impact fee is intended to be used and

commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare reduce the annual cost of flood insurance and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions

efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  7 to ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  4 controlling filling grading dredging and other development which

promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city of nampa and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material b findings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city

colorado  seattle washington  phoenix arizona  indianapolis indiana  minneapolis minnesota  las vegas nevada  and cleveland ohio the city council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for some of the activities that occur on their premises 2 employees of some sexually oriented businesses currently in operation in the city of nampa may be unable to observe the activities of their customers at all times thereby increasing the likelihood of ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities on their premises 3 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses may engage in higher incidences of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 4 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 5 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 6 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 7 at least fifty 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea chlamydia human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 8 since 198 there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states  600 in 1982  2200 in 1983  4600 in 1984  8555 in 1985  733374 in 1999  and 859000 in 2002 9 from april 198 when hiv became a reportable disease by idaho  there were seven hundred thirty six 736 cases of hivaids in the state of idaho1 10 from   reported cases of hivaids in the state of idaho decreased to seven hundred two 702 but that has been the last decrease seen in the statistics2 11 from  second quarter of 200 there has been an increasing cumulative number of cases of hivaids in the state of idaho3 12 at the end of the second quarter of 200 there were seven hundred sixty one 761 reported cases of hivaids in the state of idaho4  sterling codifiers inc  109410 13 the number of cases of syphilis reported in idaho in 200 was forty five 45 with twenty one 21 of those cases being in region 3 adams canyon gem owyhee payette and washington counties  for the first half of 200 twenty eight 28 new cases of syphilis have been reported in region 3 adams canyon gem owyhee payette and washington counties5 14 the number of cases of genital chlamydia in idaho reported annually has risen steadily since 199 with two thousand six hundred nine 2609 statewide cases reported in 200 making chlamydia the most reported of all notifiable infectious diseases in the united states of the two thousand six hundred nine 2609 cases reported in 200 four hundred seventy five 475 were in region 3 adams canyon gem owyhee payette and washington counties  for the first half of 200 two hundred forty three 243 new cases of genital chlamydia have been reported in region 3 adams canyon gem owyhee payette and washington counties6 15 the number of cases of gonorrhea reported in idaho in 200 was seventy six 76 with fourteen 14 of those cases being in region 3 adams canyon gem owyhee payette and washington counties  for the first half of 200 nine 9 new cases of gonorrhea have been reported in region 3 adams canyon gem owyhee payette and washington counties7 16 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 17 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis chlamydia and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 18 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 19 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 20 the findings noted in this section raise substantial governmental concerns 21 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 22 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 23 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in sexually oriented businesses 24 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 25 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 26 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 27 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 28 the barring of such individuals from the management of sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 29 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter  5182 definitions adult arcade any place to which the public is permitted or invited wherein coin operated or slug

original cup sanctioned provided that the new uses proposed are allowed via a new cup issuance  b conclusions in order to approve such expansions the commission shall be required to conclude that 1 the proposed expansion will not add to the existing approved use land or structural square footage whose use would be contrary to that allowed in the zoning district within which the expansion is
