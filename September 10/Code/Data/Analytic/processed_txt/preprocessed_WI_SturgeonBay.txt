of the council that this chapter regulates postconstruction stormwater discharges to waters of the state this chapter may be applied on a sitebysite basis the council recognizes however that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this chapter is preparation and implementation of comprehensive systemslevel storm water management plans that cover hydrologic units such as watersheds on a municipal and regional scale such plans may prescribe regional storm water devices practices or systems any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under  28116 wis stats for regional stormwater management measures and have been approved by the director andor the board it is the intent of this chapter that the approved plan be used to identify postconstruction management measures acceptable for the community

sturgeon bay 2 council finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can a degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature b diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacterial pathogens and other urban pollutants c alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads d reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading e threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and
