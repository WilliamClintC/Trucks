existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each

provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has

is to provide an alternative zoning scheme that can be tailored to fit a proposed development that may not otherwise fit within a standard zoning district in terms of owners desired development pattern allowed uses massing densities or type and mix of land uses an applicant may propose an mupud zoning district that accommodates development concepts that otherwise vary from strict compliance with the requirements of the citys standard zoning districts the mupud zoning district is a versatile zoning mechanism which should be used to encourage innovative and creative development design and to facilitate an appropriate mixture of land uses including residential commercial open space and other compatible land uses the mupud zoning district is not typically used to zone property to allow for the development of industrial land uses a similar zoning mechanism the planned light industrial pli zoning district is available for developments proposing to use innovative design to develop a mixture of light industrial and commercial uses this procedure is designed to allow for the processing review and approval of an mupud zoning district in order to accomplish the following objectives  to preserve the health safety and general welfare of the existing and future residents of the city of douglas   to permit adjustments to established development standards in order to encourage innovative development patterns that are more compatible with existing and planned land uses in the area   to improve the siting design character and quality of new development by allowing flexibility in terms of lot sizes building heights setbacks and other site development requirements   to encourage development that is responsive to the current market demand while still maintaining the character of the area   to provide housing of all types and designs to be located in proximity to employment and activity centers such as shopping recreational amenities public gathering places and community centers   to minimize impacts on existing infrastructure and to encourage the most efficient use of public infrastructure while limiting the costs of providing services and to reduce the burden on existing streets and utilities by encouraging more efficient development   to ensure that the layout design and construction of new development is compatible with the natural land forms and environmental conditions in the immediate and surrounding area including scenic vistas natural features and hazards and environmentally sensitive areas   to ensure the provision of active usable open space   to ensure that new development plans for and installs measures that are designed to minimize and where necessary mitigate adverse impacts to public services and infrastructure resulting from such development  and  to ensure that all mixeduse development is planned and developed in a manner that is in general conformance with the city of douglas master plan b applicability the mupud zoning district is a voluntary zoning that is customtailored to a specific development proposal the mupud zoning is not required in order to develop within the city of douglas a property owner may however seek approval of a mupud rezoning request if the owners proposed development scenario for the property will not conform to the use and dimensional requirements of the citys standard zoning districts and if the property proposed to be zoned mupud consists of at least ten 10 acres the mupud zoning district is typically used for medium to largescale developments that include a mixture of open space and residential and commercial uses development within a mupud zoning district may or may not be phased over an extended period of time  preapplication conference a preapplication conference with the city community development director or hisher designee is required prior to making a formal application for approval of a mupud rezoning request the purpose of the preapplication conference is to work

encourage innovative industrial and commercial development patterns that are more compatible with existing and planned land uses in the area   to improve the siting design character and quality of new development by allowing flexibility in terms of lot sizes building heights setbacks and other site development requirements   to encourage development that is responsive to the current market demand while still maintaining the character of the area   to minimize impacts on existing infrastructure and to encourage the most efficient use of public infrastructure while limiting the costs of providing services and to reduce the burden on existing streets and utilities by encouraging more efficient development   to ensure that the layout design and construction of new development is compatible with the natural land forms and environmental conditions in the immediate and surrounding area including scenic vistas natural features and hazards and environmentally sensitive areas   to ensure the provision of usetouse transition areas including use intensity transitions incorporating appropriate screening and buffering and constructing aesthetically compatible buildings and structures  to ensure that all adverse impacts commonly associated with light industrial and commercial uses are appropriately mitigated and that all nuisances resulting from such uses are adequately abated  to ensure that new development plans for and installs measures that are designed to minimize and where necessary mitigate adverse impacts to public services and infrastructure resulting from such development  and  to ensure that all mixeduse light industrial and commercial developments are planned and developed in a manner that is in general conformance with the city of douglas master

and basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard i flood hazard areas within the city of douglas are subject to periodic inundation which may result in the following impacts loss of life  damage to property health and safety  disruption of commerce and governmental services  extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief  and impairment of the tax base each of these impacts has the potential for adversely affecting the public health safety and general welfare ii these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage

of subdivision actions  general the process of subdividing land can often require multiple applications ranging all the way from the more conceptual sketch plan stage to the more detailspecific final plat stage additional subdivision can also occur even after the final platting stage in the form of replats final plat amendments condominium plats and townhome plats each of the subdivision processes are described below and are further defined and regulated under the procedural requirements of of this plans the sketch plan is the first step in the subdivision process for larger more complex andor multiphased subdivisions and typically precedes final development zoning if land is being annexed or rezoning if the land is already within the citys boundaries but requires rezoning to allow for the proposed development the sketch plan process is a conceptuallevel analysis of the feasibility and design qualities of a proposed development based upon the development standards of this plan applications are required to examine the feasibility of the proposed division of land including review of the following  the schematic design and layout of the proposed development   the ability to provide adequate services and utilities   the ability to minimize the existing and potential impacts of geological hazards   the ability to preserve and minimize impacts to environmentally sensitive areas   vehicular and pedestrian circulation  and  general conformance with the city master plan the requirement to obtain approval of a sketch plan shall be at the discretion of the community development department director except as otherwise required in b of this to annexations containing ten 10 or more acres the application and review procedures for a sketch plan are pursuant to the requirements of of this plats the preliminary plat process is typically the second subdivisionrelated step following approval of a sketch plan in the division of land process for larger or more complex projects and can also serve as the first subdivisionrelated step in the approval process for more moderatelysized and less complex divisions of land the provisions of of this a subdivider to move directly to the final platting process if the application for final plat approval addresses all of the requirements for both a preliminary plat application and a final plat application this option should generally be reserved for only very small or simple subdivision applications that would not be benefitted by additional review and public hearings and where the subdivider is prepared to commit to the final design and detail of a final plat application the purpose of the preliminary plat is to provide an indepth analysis of the proposed subdivision including a refinement of the design and layout due to geologic hazards environmentally sensitive areas public and utility services vehicular and pedestrian circulation and with respect to existing and approved adjacent land uses the preliminary plat process will evaluate the preliminary block lot and tract design and configuration as well as provide the city engineer with an opportunity to review preliminary engineering designs

subdivision that creates property boundaries or interests in real property shall comply with the procedures for preliminary plat if such approval is sought by the subdivider prior to making a formal final plat application if preliminary plat approval is not sought a subdivider shall prepare a final plat application that combines and complies with the procedural requirements of both a preliminary

shall receive prior approval of a final plat replat or plat amendment as applicable if a subdivider has not obtained preliminary plat approval prior to making an application for approval of a final plat then the subdivider shall prepare a final plat application that combines and complies with the submittal and procedural requirements of both a preliminary plat application pursuant to a final plat application pursuant to of this the replatting process generally involves two actions 1 vacation of a portion of the final plat where the change is proposed to occur or vacation of an entire recorded final plat where all or a majority of lot lines will be changed and 2 approval of a new final plat these actions can be reviewed and approved concurrently under the replatting process replat applications shall comply with the final plat and replat procedures in of this such replat would result in the creation of an additional lot tract or parcel or would add or remove a plat note or restriction all replats that do not result in the creation of an additional lot tract or parcel or would not add or remove a plat note or restriction shall be considered a final plat amendment as discussed below in shall be subject to the procedural requirements of either or 38 of this plat amendments final plat amendments shall be defined as either major or minor a major final plat amendment is any amendment to an approved final plat that would result in any of the following  a change to legal description of the land included within the final plat   an increase in the number of approved lots   a decrease in the amount of approved open space   a request to add or remove a plat note or restriction  or  a change in the provision of public improvements or a material change to the design of such improvements as determined by the community development department director examples of a major plat amendment include but are not limited to a vacation and replat of an approved final plat
