direction of thomas s smith city attorney this 2011 republication includes all amendatory legislation no 181 adopted dec 21 201 and was accomplished under the supervision of eric grant supplement department vice president and katrina hansen editor the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list this republication brings the code up to date no 1758  passed on  municipal capital circle sw tallahassee fl 32310 8002622633 how to use your code this code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials city employees and private citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title chapter and divisions with specific page locations in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters divisions and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by number section if applicable and year example  1992 notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end these history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index statutory references the statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality as the statutes are revised these references will be updated crossreference table when a code is based on an earlier codification the crossreference table will help users find older or prior code references in the new code the crossreference table is located near the end of the code under the tabbed divider tables this table lists the prior code section in the column labeled prior  and the new code section in the column labeled herein this table is no longer updated disposition table to find a specific ordinance in the code turn to the section called tables

normally codified such as budgets taxes annexations or rezones the disposition will be special if the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code usually at the direction of the municipality the disposition will be not codified other dispositions sometimes used are tabled pending number not used or missing this table has been replaced with the table and disposition list table and disposition list a table and disposition list has been added for use in tracking legislative history located in the back of this volume this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification the table and disposition list specifies the ordinance number adoption date description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance by use of the table and disposition list the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented and any subsequent ordinance included herein index if you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code start with the index this is an alphabetical multitier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference and crossreferences where necessary look for the main heading of the subject you need then the appropriate subheadings business license see also business tax fee  required when  the index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended instruction sheet

the left of the colon indicates the number of the title when new pages are inserted with amendments the pages will follow a point numbering system example 32 321 322   33 backs of pages that are blank

 3  editors note  1 adopted oct 21 201 amended ch 856 in its entirety to read as herein set out former ch 856   pertained to similar subject matter and derived from  adopted in 1986   adopted in 2004  and  adopted in 2007   findings a the laramie city council does hereby find that 1 numerous peer reviewed studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers including heart disease stroke respiratory disease and lung cancer at special risk are children elderly people individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired respiratory function including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease 2 unregulated hightech smoking devices commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes or ecigarettes closely resemble and purposefully mimic the act of smoking by having users inhale vaporized liquid nicotine created by heat electronic ignition system after testing a number of electronic cigarettes from two leading manufacturers the food and drug administration fda determined that various samples tested contained not only nicotine but also detectable levels of known carcinogens and toxic chemicals including tobaccospecific nitrosamines and diethylene glycol a toxic chemical used in antifreeze the fdas testing also suggested that quality control processes used to manufacture these products are inconsistent or nonexistent according to a more recent study electronic cigarette emissions are made up of a high concentration of ultrafine particles and the particle concentration is higher than in conventional tobacco cigarette smoke electronic cigarettes produce an aerosol or vapor of undetermined and potentially harmful substances which may appear similar to the smoke emitted by traditional tobacco products their use in workplaces and public places where smoking of traditional tobacco products is prohibited creates concern and confusion and leads to difficulties in enforcing the smoking prohibitions 3 health hazards induced by breathing secondhand smoke include lung cancer heart disease respiratory infection and decreased respiratory function including bronchoconstriction and bronchospasm 4 a significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace employees who work in smokefilled businesses suffer a twentyfive to fifty percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function b accordingly the laramie city council finds and declares that the purposes of the ordinance codified in this chapter are 1 to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment  and 2 to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smokefree air and to recognize that the need to breathe smokefree air shall have priority over the desire to

a the city council finds that there is an emergency requiring the immediate enactment of the ordinance codified in this chapter to preserve public health and safety due to 1 the possibility of contamination of a significant portion of laramies municipal water supply if underground petroleum storage tanks are installed without adequate design and construction standards within the fiveyear time of travel area surrounding the turner wellfield  and 2 the ability of the wyoming department of environmental quality to refuse to permit modifications to the turner wellfield if there is an existing or potential risk of pollution entering the turner wells b for the reasons stated in this chapter the city council finds an emergency concerning the public health and safety by a threefourths vote of its qualified members the city council has suspended the requirements of ws 197 15115c as amended and the corresponding provisions of this code  1995   legislative findings a the city obtains approximately sixtyeight percent of its municipal water from a single underground water source the casper formation during the cold months all of the citys municipal water comes from the casper formation aquifer if the casper aquifer were contaminated laramie would face a serious municipal water shortage the turner wells which produce up to four million gallons of municipal water per day from the casper formation are located adjacent to a developed and developing area along east grand avenue in the city b the city commissioned a study by western water consultants inc consulting engineers to determine how the city could protect the quality of its underground water as part of the study wwc produced maps indicating the time of travel of water from locations within the casper formation to the wells and springs where the city withdraws it c the developeddeveloping area along east grand lies entirely within the twentyyear time of travel contour in some locations the casper formation has some protection from contamination by the overlying satanka formation in other locations along east grand the casper formation is exposed at the surface for locations within onehalf mile to the west of the caspersatanka contact in the vicinity of the turner wellfield there are indications that the pressure gradient caused by pumping the turner wells may cause leakage from the satanka formation into the casper formation d the city has a legitimate governmental interest in preventing contamination of its water sources any contamination of the aquifer by hazardous materials is

half of the city of laramies municipal water supply and all of the drinking water supplied to albany county rural residences comes from wells and springs in the casper aquifer the delineated recharge area of the casper aquifer protection area capa encompasses approximately seventytwo square miles that lie east of the city of laramie and extends to the crest of the laramie range the north and south boundaries are approximately five and six miles north and south respectively of laramies city limits approximately four hundred fifty albany county residents and four city of laramie municipal wellfields draw water from the casper aquifer in this area the vast majority of the capa is the recharge area for the casper aquifer and consequently the casper aquifer is vulnerable to contamination from land uses in the capa exposure of the casper aquifer in the delineated area results in increased vulnerability to contamination from land uses in addition to the general vulnerability of the casper aquifer in the area where aquifer materials are exposed at the surface there are specific features that enhance the vulnerability of the aquifer to contamination a recharge into the casper aquifer system occurs rapidly as snowmelt and runoff infiltrates into porous sandstones and fractures that occur in drainages and on the land surface b there is continuous residential and commercial development pressure east of laramie where the casper aquifer is recharged development in this area increases the risk of contamination in two ways i new contamination sources homes and businesses are new sources of potential contamination to the aquifer volatile organic compounds from fuels and solvents nutrient fertilizers and pesticides from lawn care nitrates and pathogens from septic leachate ii new contamination pathways new wells and excavations which weaken the integrity of the confining layer may provide a direct conduit to the casper aquifer or reduce the hydraulic barrier provided by the satanka shale that overlies the casper aquifer c an unknown quantity of hazardous substances is transported along interstate 80 i80 and i80 transects the casper aquifer recharge area d there is the potential for the rapid transport of contaminants in the saturated zone due to a steep hydraulic gradient and enhanced aquifer permeability from fractures joints and dissolution features e the recharge area of the casper aquifer is in close physical proximity to withdrawal points for albany county and city of laramie residents the laramie city council adopts this ordinance because the casper aquifer provides a critical component of the existing and future drinking water supply for city residents especially in drought conditions the importance of the groundwater supply component was demonstrated in the summer of 2002 when the laramie river supply was reduced significantly due to drought and the city had to rely almost exclusively on groundwater 2 purpose and intent inappropriate

permitted uses in the b1 limited business b2 business c2 commercial and dc downtown commercial districts do not include residential uses however in recognition that residential and business uses can be compatible in specific locations and under specific criteria an overlay district to allow this coexistence in b1 b2 c2 and dc districts is hereby established the residential overlay for business rob districts intent is both to allow current development of this type to continue in particular situations and to allow limited new development as deemed appropriate the residential overlay for business rob district is designed for zoningmap adoption primarily upon request by property owners who wish to perpetuate or create the mixeduse circumstances for which it is intended the city may also initiate rob zoning for these reasons as situations may warrant from time to time developmental standards for the rob district are intended essentially to be a blending of the underlying b1 b2 c2 or dc standards with those in the citys highestintensity residential base zoning district  namely r3 multiplefamily this intent reflects the fact that development impacts in these districts are relatively similar in scale and that in much of the city r3 is geographically the closest residential district to most b1 b2 c2 and dc districts 2 location the rob overlay zone district shall be as illustrated on maps 9 10 11 and 12 located in subsection c the overlay zone district may be expanded from timetotime 3 applicability the residential overlay for business rob district shall be available for application to areas with b1 limited business b2 business c2 commercial or dc downtown commercial district zoning any ordinance that rezones roboverlaid property to a base zoning district other than b1 b2 c2 or dc shall have the effect of terminating the rob overlay zoning for that property any property newly zoned to the b1 b2 c2 or dc district shall be eligible for rob

aia a purpose and intent this section is intended to minimize exposure of residential and other land uses to aircraft noise to minimize the risks to public safety to minimize hazards to aviation users and those employed or residing in proximity to public aviation facilities and to promote sound land use planning and zoning practices on lands influenced by aviation operations in consideration of the hazards to aircraft of uncontrolled land use in proximity to public aviation facilities and in consideration of the noise fumes and other negative impacts of lowflying aircraft and furthermore in consideration that these influences and impacts vary in accordance with the proximity to runways this section establishes a hierarchy of restrictions and zone districts dependent upon location of the land in relation to the aviation facility in accordance with the potential hazards these zone districts impose the strictest restrictions on land located closest to the aviation facility and are less restrictive farther from the facility b applicability this section shall apply to all land within the city and unincorporated portions of albany county located within the designated aviation influence area and any specific zone district surrounding public aviation facilities and heliports regulated by the federal aviation administration if a portion of a lot parcel or tract lies within the aia or one of the zone districts described herein these restrictions upon uses and structures apply to that portion of the lot parcel or tract located within the zone district for ease of enforcement restriction area boundaries shall be drawn to the nearest quarter section of land lying outside the aia these areas are particularly described on the official zone district map as amended and are filed at the office of the city clerk this section applies to the excavation for erection of and construction of new buildings or structures and to the use of land it also applies to the reconstruction remodeling or change of use of a building or structure  movement or relocation of a building or structure to a new site or location  and to the addition or expansion of an existing building or structure c exceptions this section does not apply to lawfully constructed buildings structures and uses of land in existence on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section the nonconforming provisions of chapter 1522 nonconformities shall apply except as noted hereafter in this section d relationship to other ordinances the aia establishes a series of zone districts that identify permitted and conditional uses on lands located near an aviation facility the zone districts further establish design and performance standards for the use of lands within an airport influence area the aviation influence area and the associated zone districts shall be administered as a supplemental regulation on zoned land including planned unit developments when the land is located in proximity to public airports or heliports where land lies within one or more overlay zone districts all land use restrictions associated with the underlying zone are in full force and effect and the aia overlay districts impose additional restrictions on those of the underlying zone in the case of overlapping or conflicting requirements the most restrictive provisions shall apply e establishment of aviation influence area zone districts the following zone districts are established to regulate lands within the aviation influence area 1 aviation zone district  2 airport enterprise zone district  3 noise overlay zone district  and 4 height overlay zone district f districtspecific standards 1 boundaries this section restricts the uses allowed on lands containing aviation facilities and the uses of land surrounding aviation facilities the boundaries of each are determined as cited below a aviation zone av the boundaries of the aviation zone shall at a minimum encompass

in subsection b of this code d noise overlay district this area includes all land heavily impacted by the noise created by lowflying aircraft the geographic extent of the noise overlay for each aviation facility affecting the city will be drawn to the nearest quartersection of land lying outside the noise overlay the extent of this area shall be based upon a determination of the city managers office or board of directors of the aviation facility where due to the predominant flight patterns residents and workers are likely to be disturbed by the noise associated with aircraft at a minimum the noise overlay zone district shall contain all areas within the sixty ldn contour based upon the measurements of sound computed by the methods contained in title 14 of the federal regulations subchapter i federal aviation regulations far hereafter airport noise compatibility planning these computations shall be based upon the fleet mix that forms the worst case scenario for the type and volume of aircraft activity proposed at full buildout of the facility the district boundaries may exceed those established using i height overlay zone district this area includes all land where the height of structures or natural features may obstruct or otherwise influence aviation activities the extent of this area is determined by applying the standards and criteria listed in title

management footnotes  2  editors note  2 adopted  repealed the former ch 1520   and enacted a new ch 1520 as set out herein the former ch 1520 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from att a adopted    statutory authorization findings of fact purpose and methods a statutory authorization 1 the legislature of the state of wyoming has in ws 151601 et seq delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council of laramie wyoming does ordain as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city of laramie are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area d methods of reducing flood loss in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards
