results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damage  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this division to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  objectives the objectives of this division are to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruption  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in floodplains  f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone

objectives a this division shall be known as the groundwater protection  b background variable levels of recharge area protection can be based upon the states hydrogeology eg areas such as the dougherty plain where a major aquifer crops out would receive a relatively high degree of protection whereas other areas such as the shale hills of northwest georgia would receive a lower degree of protection recharge area protection within the significant recharge areas would be further refined based upon the local susceptibility or vulnerability to human induced pollution eg high medium or low the significant recharge areas have already been identified and mapped about 2223% of the state pollution susceptibility mapping is ongoing existing statutes are adequate for protecting the remaining recharge areas about 7778% of the state c objectives the objectives of this division are 1 protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas  2 protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development  and 3 protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality  32299 establishment of a groundwater recharge area district a groundwater recharge area district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within

chemicals injections and other human activities in the recharge area pollution susceptibility maps means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas having high medium and low groundwater pollution potential recharge area means any portion of the earths surface where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the department of natural resources in hydrologic atlas 18 1989 edition mapping of
