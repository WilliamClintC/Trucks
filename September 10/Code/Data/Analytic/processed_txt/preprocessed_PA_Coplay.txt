standards users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 cfr subchapter n parts 405471 which are hereby incorporated a where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the director of public works may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with subsections 2d and 2e below b when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the director of public works may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users c when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the director of public works shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 cfr 4036e d when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city of allentown convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the director of public works the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsections 2dla dle below 1 to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its wastewater discharge permit  b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  c provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  2019 s4 1814 18 part 1 d not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and e have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits 2 an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must a maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  b continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  c continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the director of public works whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20% from its baseline production rates determined in dlc of this notification of a revised production rate the director of public works will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and d continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to dla of this long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit 3 when developing equivalent mass limits the director of public works a will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  b upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 2019 s4 1815 sewers and sewage disposal c may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to below the industrial user must also be in compliance with of  regarding the prohibition of bypass e the director of public works may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the director of public works note when converting such limits to concentration limits the director of public works will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by of this see 40 cfr 4036d in addition the director of public works will document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass limits or vice versa and make this information publicly available see 40 cfr 4036c7 f once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in of 18102 in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived note see 40 cfr 4036c7 g many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or 4day average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation note see 40 cfr 4036c8 h any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the director of public works within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the director of public works of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate note see 40 cfr

18102 of this the specific prohibitions in subsections 1b3 b17 of 18102 of this it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either a a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or b no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its

users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 cfr subchapter n parts 405471 which are hereby incorporated a where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the director of public works may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with subsections 2d and 2e below b when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the director of public works may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users c when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the director of public works shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 cfr 4036e d when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city of allentown convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the director of public works the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsections 2dla dle below 1 to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its wastewater discharge permit  b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment 2019 s4 1866 18 part 2 standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  c provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  d not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and e have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits 2 an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must a maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  b continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  c continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the director of public works whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20% from its baseline production rates determined in dlc of this notification of a revised production rate the director of public works will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and d continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to dla of this long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit 3 when developing equivalent mass limits the director of public works a will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the 2019 s4 1867 sewers and sewage disposal industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  b upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and c may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to below the industrial user must also be in compliance with of  regarding the prohibition of bypass e the director of public works may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the director of public works note when converting such limits to concentration limits the director of public works will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by of this see 40 cfr 4036d in addition the director of public works will document how the

8200 art 1  101 202 statement of findings the governing body of the municipality finds that a inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation changes the natural hydrologic patterns destroys aquatic habitat elevates aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all of the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater can be an important resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality d public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater  269 water e federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes f nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the

management districts to implement the provisions of the little lehigh creek watershed stormwater management plan the municipality is hereby divided into stormwater management districts consistent with the little lehigh creek release rate map presented in the plan the boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on an official map which is available for inspection at the municipal office a copy of the official map at a reduced scale is included in appendix a for general reference 3 2 description of stormwater management districts two types of stormwater management districts may be applicable to the municipality namely conditional no detention districts and dual release rate districts as described below a conditional no detention districts within these districts the capacity of the local runoff conveyance facilities as defined in subpart b must be calculated to determine if adequate capacity exists for this determination the developer must calculate peak flows assuming that the site is developed as proposed and that the remainder of the local watershed is in the existing condition the developer must also calculate peak flows assuming that the entire local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls specified by this larger of the two peak flows calculated will be used in determining if adequate capacity exists if adequate capacity exists to safely transport runoff from the site to the main channel as defined in subpart 8 these watershed areas may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff without detention facilities if the capacity calculations show that the local runoff conveyance facilities lack adequate capacity the developer shall either use a 100% release rate control or provide increased capacity of downstream elements to convey increased peak flows consistent with 22616 any capacity improvements must be designed to convey runoff from development of all areas tributary to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria specified in 226 4 by definition a storm drainage problem area associated with the local runoff conveyance facilities indicates that adequate capacity does not exist b dual release rate districts within this district the twoyear postdevelopment peak runoff must be controlled to 30% of the predevelopment twoyear runoff peak further the tenyear twentyfiveyear and onehundredyear postdevelopment peak runoff must be controlled to the stated percentage of the predevelopment peak release rates associated with the ten hundredyear events vary from 50% to 100% depending upon location in the watershed a editors note said document is available at the borough offices 2634  26  8200 art 6 305 226 stormwater management district implementation provisions 1 applicants shall provide a comparative pre and postconstruction stormwater management hydrograph analysis for each direction of discharge and for the site overall to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this any stormwater management controls required by this subject to a dual release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for each of the two ten twentyfive and onehundredyear return period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology specified in 227 3 the exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the twofoot topographic contours provided as part of the drainage plan the district boundaries as originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or in certain instances are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a potential flow obstruction eg road culvert bridge etc the physical feature is the downstream limit of the subarea and the subarea boundary is drawn from that point upslope to each topographic divide along the path perpendicular to the contour lines 4 any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this use the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow rates a natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased runoff associated with a twoyear return period event within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion b natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased twentyfiveyear return period runoff without creating any hazard to persons or property c culverts bridges storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in accordance with department of environmental protection regulations if applicable and at minimum pass the increased twentyfiveyear return period runoff 5 for a proposed development site located within one release rate category subarea the total runoff from the site shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for development sites with multiple directions of runoff discharge individual drain  2635 water age directions may be designed for up to a 100% release rate so long as the total runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate 6 for a proposed development site located within two or more release category subareas the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the applicable release rate the calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by subarea an exception to the above may be granted if discharges from multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the site in this case peak discharge in any direction may be a 100% release rate provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate 7 for a proposed development site located partially within a release rate category subarea and partially within a conditional nodetention subarea a significant portion of the site area subject to the release rate control may not be drained to the discharge points located in the nodetention subarea except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver procedure 8 no portion of a site may be regraded between the little lehigh creek watershed and any adjacent watershed except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver procedure 9 within a release rate category area for a proposed development site which has areas which drain to a closed depressions the design release from the site will be the lesser of a the applicable release rate flow assuming no closed depressions or b the existing peak flow actually leaving the site in cases where b would result in an unreasonably small design release the design discharge of less than or equal to the release rate will be determined by the available downstream conveyance capacity to the main channel calculated using subsection 4 and the minimum orifice criteria 10 offsite areas which drain proposed development site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff rates however onsite drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey offsite flows development site using the capacity criteria in subsection 4 and the detention criteria in 227 11 for development sites proposed to take place in phases all detention ponds shall be designed to meet the applicable release rates applied to all site tributary areas to the proposed pond discharge direction all site tributary areas will be assumed as developed regardless of whether all site tributary areas are proposed for development at that time an exception shall be sites with multiple detention ponds in series where only the downstream pond must be designed to the stated release rate 12 where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity differs significantly from the total site area only the proposed impact area shall be subject 2636  26  to the release rate criteria the impact area includes any proposed cover or grading changes 13 development proposals which recharge or other means do not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged from the site compared to predevelopment are not subject to the release rate provisions of this no harm water quantity option a for any proposed development site not located in a conditional nodetention district the developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control including no detention if the developer can prove that special circumstances exist for the proposed development site and that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan special circumstances are defined as any hydrologic or hydraulic aspects of the development itself not specifically considered in the development of the plan runoff control strategy proof of no harm would have to be shown from the development site remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the creek with the lehigh river proof of no harm must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in subsection  4 if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm justification b attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following provisions 1 the peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the design return period storms two 10 25 and 100year shall be the values from the calibrated watershed model for the little lehigh creek or as calculated by an applicant using an alternate method acceptable to the municipality the flow values from the watershed model would be supplied to the developer by the municipality upon request 2 any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity ie if his or her site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage he or she may use up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity 3 developerproposed runoff controls which would generate increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would by definition be precluded from successful attempts to prove no harm except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with subsection 16 c any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as part of the drainage plan submission per subpart d  2637 water 15 regional detention alternatives for certain areas within the study area it may be more costeffective to provide one control facility for more than one development site than to provide an individual control facility for each development site the initiative and funding for any regional runoff control alternatives are theresponsibility of prospective developers the design of any regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed the peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined based on the required release rate at the point of discharge 16 capacity improvements a in certain instances primarily within the conditional nodetention areas local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire watershed in these instances if the developer could prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network then the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff controls on the development site peak flow calculations shall be done assuming that the local watershed is in the existing condition and then assuming that the local watershed is developed per current zoning and using the specified runoff controls any capacity improvements would be designed using the larger of the above peak flows and the capacity criteria specified in subsection 4 all new development in the entire subarea s within which the proposed development site is located shall be assumed to implement the developers proposed discharge control if any b capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to implement any regional detention alternatives or to implement a modified no harm option which proposes specific capacity improvements to provide that a less stringent discharge control would not create any harm downstream 8200 art 3

waiver request shall be in writing and accompanied by the requisite fee based upon a fee schedule adopted by the municipality a copy of the waiver request shall be provided to each of the following municipality municipal engineer municipal solicitor and lehigh valley planning commission the request shall fully document the nature of the alleged hardship a the municipality may grant a waiver provided that all of the following findings are made in a given case 1 that there are unique physical circumstances or conditions including irregularity of lot size or shape or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this the stormwater management district in which the property is located  2 that because of such physical circumstances or conditions there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this including the no harm provisions and that 2646  26  the authorization of a waiver is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property  3 that such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant  4 that the waiver if authorized will represent the m1n1mum waiver that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue  and 5 that financial hardship is not the criteria for granting of a hardship waiver b in granting any waiver the municipality may attach such conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this a hardship waiver is granted the applicant must still manage the quantity velocity direction and quality of resulting storm runoff as is necessary to prevent injury to health safety or other property 2 for regulated activities described in 2052a and b the borough council shall hear requests for and decide

alternative approach for managing stormwater runoff natural hydrologic conditions may be altered radically by poorly planned development practices such as introducing unneeded impervious surfaces destroying existing drainage swales constructing unnecessary storm sewers and changing local topography a traditional drainage approach of development has been to remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a detention basin this approach leads ultimately to the degradation of water quality as well as expenditure of additional resources for detaining and managing concentrated runoff at some downstream location the recommended alternative approach is to promote practices that will minimize postdevelopment runoff rates and volumes which will minimize needs for artificial conveyance and storage facilities to simulate predevelopment hydrologic conditions forced infiltration is often necessary to offset the loss of infiltration by creation of impervious surfaces the ability of the ground to infiltrate depends upon the soil types and its conditions preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful alternative site design considerations site design practices include preserving natural drainage features minimizing impervious surface area reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces and protecting natural depression storage a welldesigned site will contain a mix of all those features the following describes various techniques to achieve the alternative approach  preserving natural drainage features protecting natural drainage features particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels is desirable because of their ability to infiltrate and attenuate flows and to filter pollutants however this objective is often not accomplished in land development in fact commonly held drainage philosophy encourages just the opposite pattern streets and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in the natural headwater valleys and swales thereby replacing natural drainage functions with a completely impervious system as a result runoff and pollutants generated from impervious surfaces flow directly into storm sewers with no opportunity for attenuation infiltration or filtration developments designed to fit site topography also minimize the amount of grading on site  protecting natural depression storage areas depressional storage areas have no surface outlet or drain very slowly following a storm event they can be commonly seen as ponded areas in farm fields during the wet season or after large runoff events traditional development practices eliminate these depressions by filling or draining thereby obliterating their ability to reduce surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants the volume and releaserate characteristics of depressions should be protected in the design of the development site the depressions can be protected by simply avoiding the depression or by incorporating its storage as additional capacity in required detention facilities  avoiding introduction of impervious areas careful site planning should consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible building footprints sidewalks  26 attachment 81 water driveways and other features producing impervious surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff  reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces impervious surfaces are significantly less of a problem if they are not directly connected to an impervious conveyance system such as storm sewer two basic ways to reduce hydraulic connectivity are routing of roof runoff over lawns and reducing the use of storm sewers site grading should promote increasing travel time of stormwater runoff and should help reduce concentration of runoff to a single point in the development  routing roof runoff over lawns roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns in most site designs the practice discourages direct connections of downspouts to storm sewers or parking lots the practice also discourages sloping driveways and parking lots to the street by routing roof drains and crowning the driveway to run off to the lawn the lawn is essentially used as a filter strip  reducing the use of storm sewers by reducing use of storm sewers for draining streets parking lots and back yards the potential for accelerating runoff from the development can be greatly reduced the practice requires greater use of swales and may not be practical for some development sites especially if there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a reasonable time the practice requires educating local citizens and public works officials who expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event  reducing street widths street widths can be reduced by either eliminating onstreet parking or by reducing roadway widths municipal planners and traffic designers should encourage narrower neighborhood streets which ultimately could lower maintenance  limiting sidewalks to one side of the street a sidewalk on one side of the street may suffice in lowtraffic neighborhoods the lost sidewalk could be replaced with bicycle recreational trails that follow backoflot lines where appropriate backyard trails should be constructed using pervious materials  using permeable paving materials these materials include permeable interlocking concrete paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete such materials should be considered as alternatives to conventional pavement surfaces especially for low use surfaces such as driveways overflow parking lots and emergency access roads  reducing building setbacks reducing building setbacks reduces driveway and entry walks and is most readily accomplished along lowtraffic streets where traffic noise is not a problem  constructing cluster developments cluster developments can also reduce the amount of impervious area for a given number of lots the biggest savings is in street length which also will reduce costs of the development cluster development clusters the construction activity onto lesssensitive areas without substantially affecting the gross density of development 26 attachment 82  26 appendix g 26 attachment 9 borough of coplay appendixg preliminary site investigation and testing requirements required data and site information the following data shall be gathered utilizing standard testing procedures as part of a preliminary site investigation bedrock composition any apparent boundaries between carbonate and nonarbonate bedrock must be verified by a qualified geotechnical professional bedrock structural geology  this includes the possible presence of faults and mapping of conspicuous fracture traces or lineaments overburden and soil mantle composition and thickness permeability of the soil depth to the seasonal high water table presence of special geologic features ibis includes sinkholes closed depressions fracture traces lineaments and geologic contacts between carbonate and noncarbonate bedrock investigation required for all sites review of available data maps and reports some of the required information as listed above can be found in existing published data suggested resources include the following geologic maps and references for the development area the little lehigh creek basin carbonate prototype area closed depression map  available at the lvpc usgs topographic maps lehigh and berks county soil survey maps aerial photographs from the lvpc or other sources relevant pennsylvania geologic survey open file reports kochanov 1987a 1987b that provide maps of sinkholes and karst features for lehigh and berks counties field inspections in addition to gathering data from published sources a field inspection of the proposed site is required a field inspection can provide additional information relating to site features such as carbonate bedrock features indicators of seasonal high streamlevel or water table levels streams springs etc soil test pit and percolation test requirements a minimum of one test pit and a minimum of two percolation tests are required for every site a test pit is a two to threefoot wide eightfootdeep trench excavated with a backhoe for observing subsurface conditions the test pits will be used to describe soil depth and quality including soil horizons and testing of permeability or percolation rates  26 attachment 91 water percolation tests are to be conducted as follows adapted from  7315 percolation tests of the pennsylvania  1 the percolation tests shall be made in separate holes uniformly spaced over the possible infiltration area 2 an initial presoak should not be performed 3 percolation holes located within the possible infiltration area shall be used in the calculation of the average percolation rate 4 holes having a uniform diameter of six to 10 inches shall be bored or dug as follows a to the depth of the bottom of the possible infiltration bmp b alternate depths if the test pitsauger holes indicate that the soils are more suitable at a different depth ie if a clay horizon is identified and more suitable soils are located beneath the horizon and infiltration test should be performed in the suitable horizon 5 the bottom and sides of the hole shall be scarified with a knife blade or sharppointed instrument to completely remove any smeared soil surfaces and to provide a natural soil interface into which water may percolate loose material shall be removed from the hole two inches of coarse sand or fine gravel shall be placed in the bottom of the hole to protect the soil from scouring and clogging of the pores 6 immediately before the percolation test as a final presoak water shall be placed in the hole to a minimum depth of sixinches over the gravel and readjusted every 30 minutes for 1 hour 7 the drop in the water level during the last 30 minutes of the final presoaking period shall be applied to the following standard to determine the time interval between readings for each percolation hole a if water remains in the hole the interval for readings during the percolation test shall be 30 minutes b if no water remains in the hole the interval for readings during the percolation test may be reduced to 10 minutes 8 mter the final presoaking period water in the hole shall again be adjusted to approximately sixinches over the gravel and readjusted when necessary after each reading a measurement to the water level in the individual percolation holes shall be made from a fixed reference point and shall continue at the interval determined from step no 7 above for each individual percolation hole until a minimum of eight readings are completed or until a stabilized rate of drop is obtained whichever occurs first a stabilized rate of drop means a difference of 14 of an inch or less of 26 attachment 92  26 appendix g drop between the highest and lowest readings of four consecutive readings b the drop that occurs in the final period in percolation test holes expressed as inches per hour shall be used to calculate the average percolation rate c when the rate of drop in a percolation test is too slow to obtain a measurable rate the rate of 025 inches per hour shall be assigned to that hole for use in calculating the average percolation rate the infiltration area may be placed over holes with no measurable rate when the average percolation rate for the possible infiltration area is within the acceptable range when a percolation test hole yields a percolation rate of greater than 12 inches per hour the proposed infiltration area may not be designed or installed within 25 feet of this hole unless the municipality determines that a testing anomaly caused the fast percolation rate and a retest of the area yields acceptable percolation rates this percolation rate limit is established to protect groundwater quality and to minimize the risk of subsidence additional site investigation and testing required if infiltration is proposed soil test pit requirements the required number of test pits varies with effective soil thickness as risk factors increase the number of test pits increases a minimum of 2 test pits uniformly spaced within the proposed infiltration area eg the 2 pits should be centered on each half of the proposed infiltration area are required for any site proposing infiltration unless the applicant can demonstrate that one test pit is adequately representative of the area proposed for infiltration for larger infiltration areas multiple test pits shall be developed at the densities as listed below test pit density percolation tests per acre of pro per acre of pro auger grid spac effective soil posed infiltration posed

for carbonate areas because soil depth is not uniform in many carbonate areas test pits will not be sufficient to accurately determine the depth to bedrock augering provides this essential data as inexpensively as possible trackrig rotary soil auger test drilling allows relatively inexpensive qualitative determination of the presence of overburden voids and will generally penetrate to the topofbedrock augers typically extend to depths of 20 feet special augers extend to as much  26 attachment 93 water as 50 feet augers do not extend into the bedrock auger testing should be performed in a grid pattern across the proposed infiltration area spaced as indicated in the above table percolation testing requirements a minimum of six percolation tests shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures listed above unless the applicant can demonstrate that fewer tests accurately represent the percolation rate of the proposed infiltration area additional testing shall be required if the initial test results show significant variability in percolation rate for larger infiltration areas percolation tests shall be conducted at the densities listed in the table above 26 attachment 94

descriptions but are not part of the actual ordinance start by using the following parts of the zoning please contact the zoning officer to make sure you have the latest version of the zoning map  turn to the table of contents and the index at the end of the document2 to find the pages and sections that apply to your particular situation you may wish to photocopy the table of contents to highlight the relevant sections  consult the zoning map at the end of this zoning determine the zoning district that includes your lot  turn to 27306 the table of permitted uses by zoning district which indicates the uses permitted in each zoning district a use is permitted in three ways a by right b by special exception the zoning hearing board must approve the use as described in 27116 c as a conditional use the borough council must approve the use as described in 27117  turn to 27307 the table of lot and setback requirements by zoning district this table states the required minimum size of each lot and the required minimum distance that buildings must be from streets and other lot lines in each zoning district  regularly refer to the definitions in 27202 to determine the meaning of specific words if a lot is already being legally used for a particular purpose and that use is not permitted in the zoning district according to 27306 that use is called a nonconforming use in almost all cases a lawful nonconforming use can continue can expand within limits can change to another use within limits and can be sold see 27 805 nonconformities 1 editors note these two pages of using this an overview were adopted as part of 132012 2 editors note the zoning index appears at the end of the index to the borough of coplay ordinances  275 zoning certain specific uses must comply with additional regulations the principal uses which are the primary use of a property are listed in alphabetical order in 27402 and the accessory uses which are secondary uses such as lowintensity businesses in a home are listed in alphabetical order in 27403 additional regulations are listed for sheds garages and other structures typically found on a residential lot under residential accessory structures in 27403 turn to the following regulations concerning parking signs and buffer yards  many uses must provide a minimum number of offstreet parking spaces under 27601 of this parking standards are listed in a table  if signs are proposed within public view must be met this the types heights and sizes of signs that are permitted  certain uses are required to provide an open buffer yard with evergreen screening to buffer nearby homes and adjacent residentially zoned land from nuisances see 27803 you should also keep the following additional considerations in mind when using this an applicant may apply to the borough zoning hearing board for a zoning variance if heshe is not able to comply with a provision of this application fee is required to compensate the borough for legal advertisements and other costs see 27111 which includes the standards that must be met under state law in order to be granted a variance generally under the pennsylvania municipalities planning variances are not permitted unless an applicant proves a legal hardship  generally if one or more new lots will be created or existing lot lines will be altered or one or more new principal nonresidential buildings are proposed then the requirements and approval procedures of the boroughs subdivision and land development  will also apply this is a separate ordinance available at borough hall3  if there will be significant disturbance of the ground it will be necessary to use certain measures to control soil erosion in such case contact the county conservation district any questions concerning this be directed to the boroughs zoning officer the zoning officer also administers applications for permits 3 editors note the subdivision and land development codified as subdivision and

prevent the creation or establishment of airport hazards state law requires every municipality having an airport hazard area within its municipal borders to adopt administer and enforce airport zoning regulations for such airport hazard area these regulations divide the area into zones and within the zones regulate the height to which structures may be erected or objects of natural growth may be allowed to grow 2 purposes a to carry out the authority conferred by the pa airport zoning act in addition to the authority of the pa municipalities planning to recognize that an obstruction along an airport approach has the potential for endangering lives and property  and that an obstruction may affect approach minimums of an airport  and that an obstruction may reduce the size of areas available for the landing takeoff and maneuvering of aircraft thus tending to impair the utility of an airport and the public investment therein c to prevent the creation or extension of obstructions
