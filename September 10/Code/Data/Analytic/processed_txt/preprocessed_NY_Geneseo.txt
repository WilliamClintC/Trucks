the following design standards are in accordance with the vision set forth by the village comprehensive plan adopted on  for the district now defined as mixed use  two mu2 on the official zoning district map the purpose of these standards is to describe the desired future development pattern form massing site layout and architectural detailing for the mu2 district as described in the comprehensive plan this area is currently not reflective of the traditional village character desired by the community based upon input provided by residents and landowners throughout the planning process and recorded in the community survey public meetings and official hearings the village understands that the current form site layout and architectural detailing are the result of past zoning regulations and planning decisions that do not represent the future vision of the community for this reason the village views this area as a transitional location between the historic village core and the modern suburban pattern of development east of the village given its transitional nature there is a need for clear standards that meet the goals and objectives of the community while still allowing for flexibility and creativity these standards when utilized with the mu2 bulk and use table  130135 will provide the necessary regulatory guidance and framework for flexible design alternatives to accomplish the vision set forth in the comprehensive plan 2 design elements a site planning site planning standards primarily address the organization of a projects components they deal with the location of buildings and site features such as parking lots open space and service areas as well as the organization of circulation patterns for vehicles and pedestrians b streetscape

public spaces and it is especially important to acknowledge their significance in the retention or development of highquality neighborhoods and districts c architectural expression architectural standards deal with the exterior elements of buildings and components that define the look of a building such as roofs windows articulation and details standards for architectural elements will

york state  clearing of 12 or fewer trees of less than or equal to six inches in diameter at breast height within one calendar year a legislative intent 1 the intent of this planned residential development district prd provision is to encourage a greater degree of flexibility for development and to provide a variety of residential uses in a planned controlled environment and in a manner blending all land uses into a functionally and aesthetically complementary whole a planned residential development proposal may contain both individual building sites and common property which are proposed for development as an integrated land use 2 this section recognizes that the standard zoning function bulk and use and the subdivision function platting and design are appropriate for the regulation of land use in areas or neighborhoods that are already substantially developed these controls represent a type of regulation which may be adverse to the techniques of land development contained in the planned residential development concept a rigid set of space requirements along with bulk and use specifications would frustrate the application of this concept thus where prd techniques are deemed appropriate rezoning of land to a planned residential development district by the village board the use and dimensional specifications elsewhere in the codes of the village of geneseo are replaced by an approval process in which an approved prd plan becomes the basis for continuing land use controls b definitions terms used in this section are defined in of the village objectives to implement the intent of the planned residential development provision the following objectives must be met 1 a combination of the types of environment occupancy tenure eg cooperatives condominium leasing types of housing and lot sizes available to persons at varying economic levels 2 provision of usable open space water quality facilities and recreation areas 3 a development pattern which preserves trees outstanding natural topography manmade historic features and structures and geographic features and prevents soil erosion  13040 geneseo code  13041  4 a development pattern which wherever possible extends mimics or otherwise complements the existing street grid pattern of the historic village core 5 a creative use of land and related physical development which allows an orderly transition of land from existing village neighborhoods to adjacent undeveloped village lands andor rural areas in the town 6 an efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets 7 a development pattern in harmony with the objectives of this section and the comprehensive plan 8 a more desirable environment than would be possible strict application of

providing offsets in exterior walls  providing an accent form or forms  and providing a variation in rooflines or heights that are compatible with the design theme the areas and patterns of glazing used in facades should be compatible with the threedimensional design of the building b exterior walls above grade that are attached to buildings should appear to be integral to the building ie walls attached to brick building surfaces should be reddishcolored brick in keeping with the historic character of the community other abovegrade screening walls such as dumpster enclosures or transformer screen walls should match materials and colors used in the building facades c building entrances building entrances should be in scale with the building facade and have weather cover d color and
