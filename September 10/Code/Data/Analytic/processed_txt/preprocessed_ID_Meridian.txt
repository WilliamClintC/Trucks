adopted by the city pursuant to title 67 chapter 65 idaho including but not limited to the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan and the general governmental goal of protecting the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and its area of city impact it is necessary that the citys public facilities for 1 park and recreation public facilities  and 2 public safety public facilities for law enforcement and fire to accommodate new growth and development within the city and its area of city impact b new residential and nonresidential growth and development imposes and will impose increasing demands upon the public facilities c the revenues generated from new residential and nonresidential growth and development often do not generate sufficient general funds to provide the necessary improvements of these public facilities to accommodate new growth and development d new growth and development are expected to continue and will place ever increasing demands on the city to provide and expand the public facilities to serve new growth and development e the city has planned for the improvement of the public facilities in the capital improvements element of the city of meridian comprehensive plan f the creation of an equitable impact fee system would enable the city to impose a proportionate share of the costs of needed improvements to the public facilities to accommodate new growth and development and would assist the city in implementing the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan g in order to implement an equitable impact fee system for the public facilities the city retained bbc research & consulting to prepare an impact fee study for these types of facilities the resulting document titled the city of meridian impact fee study and capital improvements plan dated  the impact fee study recommended for approval by the impact fee advisory committee is on file in the office of the city clerk of the city of meridian  sterling codifiers inc  252415 h the impact fee study is consistent with the capital improvements element of the city of meridian comprehensive plan and uses the levels of service set forth in the comprehensive plan for these public facilities i the impact fee study sets forth reasonable methodologies and analyses for determining the impacts of various types of new growth and development on the public facilities and determines the cost of acquiring or constructing the improvements necessary to meet the demands for such public facilities created by new growth and development j the impact fee study uses a calculation methodology in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is net of credits for the present value of revenues that will be generated by new growth and development based on historical funding patterns and that are anticipated to be available to pay for system improvements including taxes assessments user fees and intergovernmental transfers and included consideration of the following factors 1 the cost of existing system improvements within the service area  2 the means by which existing system improvements have been financed  3 the extent to which the new growth and development will contribute to the cost of system improvements assessment or developer or landowner contributions or has previously contributed to the cost of system improvements or landowner contributions  4 the extent to which the new growth and development is required to contribute to the cost of existing system improvements in the future  5 the extent to which the new growth and development should be credited for providing system improvements without charge to other properties within the service area  6 extraordinary costs if any incurred in serving the new growth and development  7 the time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of impact fees paid at different times  and 8 the availability of other sources of funding system improvements including but not limited to user charges general tax levies transfers and special taxation k the maximum allowable impact fees described in this chapter are based on the impact fee study and do not exceed the costs of system improvements for the public facilities to serve new growth and development that will pay the impact fees l the police fire and parks and recreation public facilities included in the calculation of impact fees in the impact fee study will benefit all new growth and development throughout the city and it is therefore appropriate to treat all areas of the city and the area of city impact as a single service area for purposes of calculating collecting and spending the impact fees collected m there is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between the development impacts created by each type of development covered by this chapter and the impact fees that such development will be required to pay n this chapter creates a system by which impact fees paid by new growth and development will be used to finance defray or to provide capital improvements for the public facilities in ways that benefit the development for which impact fees were paid o this chapter creates a system under which impact fees shall not be used to correct existing deficiencies in public facilities or to replace or rehabilitate existing public facilities or to pay for routine operation or maintenance of those public facilities p this chapter is consistent with all applicable provisions of title 67 chapter 82 idaho concerning impact fee ordinances  1072 authority applicability and effective date a this chapter is enacted pursuant to the citys general police powers pursuant to the authority granted to the city by title 50 idaho
