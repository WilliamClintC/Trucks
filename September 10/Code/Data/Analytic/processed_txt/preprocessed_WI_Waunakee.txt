houston texas  indianapolis indiana  amarillo texas  garden grove california  los angeles california  whittier california  austin texas  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  cleveland ohio  and beaumont texas the board finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this section as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidences of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b and trichomoniasis 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative

1000000 with herpes 5500000 with human papillomavirus 120000 with hepatitis b and 5000000 with trichomoniasis overall the cdc estimates there are 15000000 new cases of sexually transmitted diseases each year tracking the hidden epidemics trends in stds in the united states united states health and human services department center for disease control 2000 11 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 12 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 13 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 14 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adultoriented films 15 the consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises of a sexually oriented business exacerbates the deleterious secondary effects of such businesses on the community 16 the findings noted in subsections b1 15 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns 17 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect these substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the public it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 20 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 21 it is necessary to license entertainers in the adult entertainment industry to prevent the exploitation of minors to ensure that each such entertainer is an adult and to ensure that such entertainers have not assumed a false name which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible 22 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23 proximity between entertainers and patrons during adult entertainment performances can facilitate sexual contact prostitution and related crimes 24 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 25 the license fees required in this article are necessary as nominal fees imposed as necessary regulatory measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the village in regulating sexually oriented businesses 26 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the village will be promoted by the enactment of this article 27 it is not the intent of this article to suppress or censor any expressive activities protected by the first amendment of the united states constitution or of the wisconsin constitution but rather to enact time place and manner regulations which address the compelling interests of the village in mitigating the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses    312004 violations a a person who operates or causes to be operated a

stormwater runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing stream bed scour diminishing groundwater recharge and diminishing stream base flows  2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing loadings of nutrients and other urban pollutants  3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads  4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading  5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainageways and other minor drainage facilities  6 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes  7 undermine floodplain

require limited applicability of this chapter to condominium developments the state legislature has recognized that subdivision ordinances may apply to condominiums but that subdivision ordinances shall not impose burdens upon condominiums that are different from those imposed on other property of a similar character not subject to a declaration of condominium  2 the factor that makes this chapter applicable to a condominium development is the creation of multiple distinct property entities at or near the ground surface subject to property taxation as separate parcels with each property entity having different ownership and management the village determines that this factor makes a condominium development dissimilar both physically and in ownership from developments in which the land and improvements are under unitary ownership management and control  3 thus the village board finds that new condominium developments can place impacts on community resources in the same manner as other new developments which are characterized by division of land into lots these impacts include a additional population density  b possibility of use of particular land in a manner unsuitable to the lands characteristics  c additional demands upon village parks recreation areas utility facilities and schools  d additional traffic and street use b portions of chapter applicable to condominium developments the following sections of this chapter shall apply to condominium developments 1 relating to land suitability and construction practices  2 relating to preliminary plat approval this stage of approval shall be the only approval required for a condominium development the technical requirements for preliminary plats set forth in section 129121 shall not apply since condominiums have separate technical standards set forth in wis stats ch 703  3 of this chapter relating to required improvements  4 of this chapter relating to design standards for improvements  5 of this chapter relating to dedication requirements  6 relating to fees for review c exemptions this section shall not apply to any condominium plat recorded prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which
