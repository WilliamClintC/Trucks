preliminary or final the board of supervisors andor the planning commission may hold a public meeting thereon after public notice effect of approval of preliminary plan approval of the preliminary plan by the planning commission and the township supervisors constitutes conditional approval of the subdivision as to the character and intensity of development the general layout and the approximate dimensions of streets lots and other planned features this approval binds the subdivider to the general scheme shown on the preliminary plan approval of the preliminary plan shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plan nor does it authorize recording of the preliminary plan or the sale of any lots  however such approval does authorize the subdivider to proceed with the

amount of required financial security by redetermining the estimated cost for completion of the uncompleted improvements as of the expiration of the ninetieth 90th day after either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of completion subsequent to said adjustment the township may require the subdivider or developer to post additional security in order to insure that the financial security equals one hundred ten 110% percent of the estimated cost of the township completing the improvements at a time ninety 90 days following the date scheduled for completion or alternatively reduce the required security so that it equals such amount the cost of the determination by the township engineer shall be paid by the subdivider or developer any additional security shall be posted by the subdivider or developer within thirty 30 days after being notified of the same as the work of installing the required improvements proceeds the party posting the financial security may request the township to release or authorize the release from time to time such portions of the financial security necessary for the payment to the contractor or contractors performing the work any such request shall be in writing addressed to the iv5  governing body and the governing body shall have fortyfive 45 days from the receipt of such request within which to allow the

the tract being subdivided or developed or from a nearby tract being subdivided or developed or from a nearby tract of land within two 2 miles from the tract being subdivided as opposed to being pumped from a reservoir or from the susquehanna river irrespective of whether that water is being distributed as part of a public water supply system the board of supervisors will approve the proposed water system only if 1 the proposal is for residential use and the proposed unit density does not exceed one dwelling per 32000 square feet of area for example if the tract being developed or subdivided is 100 acres in size no further study will be required if no more than 136 dwelling units are proposed  or 2 the proposal is for commercial industrial or other nonresidential use and it is apparent to the township that water usage will not exceed 350 gallons per day for each 32000 squares feet of tract area and the applicant sets forth a plan or proposal pursuant to which usage can reasonably be monitored by the township and prohibitions of usage in excess of 350 gallons per day for each 32000 square feet of tract area can effectively be enforced by the township all costs incurred by the township in monitoring usage and enforcement of the use limitations shall be paid by the water users  or 3 a site specific water availability study performed by the township at the expense of the applicant establishes that the groundwater recharge on the tract in question after development computed during drought conditions periods when precipitation is 40 percent below normal will exceed the anticipated water usage figures computed by using department of environmental protection figures of 35 persons per dwelling unit and average daily usage of 100 gallons per person per day where residential use is contemplated and will exceed projected water usage by at least 10 percent when commercial or industrial uses or concentrated animal operations or concentrated animal feeding operations or other nonresidential uses are contemplated and that the installation of the proposed systems will not lower the groundwater table in the area so as to endanger or decrease the groundwater supplies available to other properties in the area of the subdivision or land development the study shall be conducted in the following manner 1 prior to commencement of the study the applicant shall place in escrow with the township 110 percent of the funds estimated by the townships consultant to be necessary in order to complete the study  2 in the event industrial or commercial use or other nonresidential use is intended the applicant shall prior to commencement of the study set forth the proposed nature of the industrial or commercial use or other nonresidential use the number of employees and whether of not water will be used to clean up andor to process or otherwise in connection with the proposed use where a concentrated animal operation or a concentrated animal feeding operation is contemplated the applicant shall set forth the type number and size of animals proposed  3 the consultant shall determine the postdevelopment recharge from the tract during a one 1 in ten 10 year drought or a forty percent 40% reduction in average annual precipitation for the study area based upon postdevelopment grades  and impervious conditions the recharge analysis shall include estimated recharge from onlot sewage disposal systems if same are proposed from postdevelopment storm water management systems and from proposed storm water infiltration facilities recharge from storm water management facilities shall be based upon analysis of probe holes and percolation tests performed at the depth which represents the bottom of the proposed facilities after installation in evaluating recharge from infiltration facilities the consultant shall give consideration to the types of soils in the area where such facilities will be installed and shall recognize that the township does not have and will not have the capability of insuring that such facilities are properly maintained so as to function as designed thus giving recognition to the fact that some of these facilities will either not function at all or will not properly function in order for the consultant to accurately evaluate the impact on existing wells in the area the applicant shall prior to the study drill production wells with sufficient capacity to provide for the water needs of the development during drought conditions when rainfall is forty percent 40% below normalthe consultant shall assume the water needs of the development to be 350 gallons per day per dwelling unit for residential use and a sufficient supply to meet the estimated needs of industrial commercial or other nonresidential development plus a ten percent 10% reserve capacity the applicant shall also cause to be drilled a sufficient number of test wells in the area andor arrange for monitoring existing neighboring wells so that the consultant can accurately evaluate the impact of production wells on the underground water supply under the supervision of the consultant the applicant shall cause the production wells to be pumped for seventytwo 72 hours constant rate test during which time water levels in the surrounding test wells and neighboring wells will be continuously evaluated for impact so as to enable the consultant to determine whether or not the groundwater table in the area will be lowered so as to adversely impact groundwater supplies to neighboring properties the final report shall contain pump test results of constant rate tests as 15 times the yield required to supply the water needs of the development calculated as above set forth in the event the proposal is for commercial industrial or other nonresidential use the applicant shall set forth a proposed allocation of available water supply between or among proposed users and set forth a plan or proposal pursuant to which usage can reasonably be monitored by the township and prohibitions of usage in excess of the maximum permitted by costs incurred by the township in monitoring usage and enforcement of the use limitations shall be paid by the water users amended  and  for this purpose the subdivision or land development shall be considered to consist of all contiguous land owned on  by the same land owner as lands owned by the applicant now proposed for subdivision or land development land shall be considered contiguous even though separated by public or private roads v8  article vi final

overcrowding of land j blight k danger and congestion in travel and transportation l injury or loss of health life or property from fire flood panic or other dangers this enacted as part of the overall plan for the orderly growth and development of peach bottom township and as such it is an integral part of the township comprehensive plan i1 establishment of zones the township of peach bottom is divided into zones enumerated below and shown on the zoning map of peach bottom township which map is part of this rii________residential ii c__________commercial i__________industrial a__________agricultural boundaries of zones where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of the zones as shown on the zoning map the following rules shall apply a boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets highways or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines b boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines c boundaries indicated as approximately following municipality limits shall be construed as following municipality limits d boundaries indicated as following

be determined by the scale of the map g where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the official zoning map or in circumstances not covered by subsections a above the zoning hearing board shall interpret the district boundaries i2 statement of community development objectives the primary objective of the townships development policy is to preserve for agricultural use the major portion of the townships quality farmlands this should be done by preserving most of the best land in agricultural use and by minimizing the presence of conflicting uses in the agricultural zones which would tend to impair or interfere with continued agricultural activity preservation of farmland should be achieved by a directing residential growth away from areas of quality farmland b utilizing the least productive farmland where possible for industrial commercial and residential growth c providing an extensive well insulated agricultural area in order to encourage continued agriculture and agricultural related industries d preventing the township from becoming the sites for leapfrog development and exurban sprawl e maintaining agricultural parcels or farms in sizes which will permit efficient agricultural operations lands set aside for agricultural should reflect the better agricultural soils as well as including those areas to be protected from unnecessary development where feasible soils classified as good for agricultural purposes should be preserved for agricultural use in planning for agricultural land it is the townships policy not to consider agricultural land as undeveloped farmland awaiting another use farmland must be considered as developed land it is being used to produce a product farming is a land intensive manufacturing process which converts raw materials into a product comparable to other industrial operations with occasional accompanying nuisances of noise odor and dust the agricultural zone should not be considered as a holding zone but as a zone having a positive purpose of utilizing the townships natural resources for the benefit of the entire community and the township should protect the agricultural zone from interference by incompatible uses which breakdown the integrity of the zone and also interfere with normal and customary operations within the zone residential development should occur in limited amounts consistent with the areas needs however the township does not represent a reasonable or logical place for urban oriented residential growth to occur generally residential growth should represent an expansion of the borough of delta and an infilling of the susquehanna trails development which at this time has large numbers of undeveloped lots some minimal development should occur in the agricultural or nondevelopment areas of the township this development should be directed toward the lower quality agricultural soils large lot or farmette type of development wastes land and should be discouraged i3 the borough of delta at present has a public water supply system and a public sewer system these systems are currently serving residents of the borough and residents of areas of the township adjacent to the borough it is the townships objective that development in the township is concentrated in areas that can be served by the delta borough public water system and public sewer system with developers making arrangements to assume their proper share of the costs of these facilities and the township residents being served by such facilities contributing fairly to operating costs the township recognizes that the borough of deltas public water system is totally dependent on ground water and that the recharge areas for the boroughs wells include significant land areas within the township therefore the township will work cooperatively with the borough in its efforts to develop a wellhead protection program to protect the quality of the ground water resource the townships need for commercial and industrial enterprise is minimal but to the extent commercial development is to occur it should occur near present population centers and so as not to increase traffic or residential and farm roads if industrial development is to occur it is important that it not degrade the quality environment currently existing in the township and that it not have the effect of accelerating residential and commercial development in order to serve the residential and commercial needs of those who would be employed in such industry with the resulting loss of productive farmland and environmental quality the township recognizes that its road network will require continuing maintenance and upgrading if it is to properly serve the needs of township citizens the township recognizes that the susquehanna trails development is to a large degree served by private roads which can only become acceptable for adoption as public roads by enormous expense how the residents of that area can have better highway access without adversely impacting the townships financial resources represents a major challenge the township also recognizes that its existing recreational areas will need continuing maintenance and improvement and that with population growth additional recreation facilities will be required and plans are for them to be constructed gradually as resources become available and they become needed i4 part ii zone regulations a use regulations 1 type & extent of uses permitted uses permitted the uses permitted in the zones established by this
