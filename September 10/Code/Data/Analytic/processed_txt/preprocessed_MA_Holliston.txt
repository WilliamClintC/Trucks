proposed project with less adverse effects and that 2 such activities including proposed mitigation measures will have no significant adverse impact on the areas or values protected by this bylaw the commission shall regard as practicable an alternative which is reasonably available and capable of being done after taking into consideration the proposed property use overall project purpose eg residential institutional commercial or industrial logistics existing technology costs of the alternatives and overall project costs to prevent resource area loss the commission shall require applicants to avoid alteration wherever feasible  to minimize alteration  and where alteration is unavoidable and has been minimized to provide full mitigation the cmmnission may authorize or require replication of wetlands as a foim of mitigation but because of the high likelihood of failure of replication only with specific plans professional design proper safeguards adequate security and professional monitoring and reporting to assure success the commission may require a wildlife habitat study of the project area to be paid for by the applicant whenever it deems appropriate regardless of the type of resource area or the amount or type of alteration proposed the decision to require a wildlife habitat study shall be based upon the commissions estimation of the importance of the habitat area considering but not limited to such town general bylaws 37 town of holliston factors as proximity to other areas suitable for wildlife importance of wildlife corridors in the area or
