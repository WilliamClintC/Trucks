following goals in the geographic distribution of retail alcoholic beverage licenses in the township a this policy document pertains to two types of liquor licenses that wall township currently controls plenary retail consumption licenses and plenary retail distribution licenses consumption licenses are utilized by bars and restaurants while distribution licenses are utilized by liquor stores in the retail sale of liquor where liquor is not consumed onsite b wall township currently controls 12 plenary retail consumption licenses and one plenary retail distribution license a liquor licenses can be used as an incentive to the redevelopment of commercial areas in need thereof b liquor licenses should be distributed geographically in a manner that provides opportunity for commercial zones throughout the township and the population that they serve c a concentration of consumption licenses in any one part of the township may be undesirable to adjacent neighborhoods particularly if they are granted to bars or taverns that typically operate until  am a foster and maintain a geographical distribution of consumption and distribution licenses so as to provide opportunities to underserved areas and areas of future growth b utilize retail liquor licenses where appropriate to encourage redevelopment of commercial areas c consider the potential negative impacts of concentrating retail liquor licenses into a limited geographical area before permitting new licenses within alreadyserved areas  6228 alarms  6231   6231 retail license distribution

3 route 34 corridor restaurants in the corridor are desired to provide services to existing and proposed corporate offices in the corridor b lowest priority areas 1 route 35 corridor south of allaire road  and 2 route 35 corridor north of allaire road properties in the route 35 corridor already hold a majority of the existing retail liquor licenses in the township particularly route 35 south of allaire road it is the townships intention to limit the distribution of additional licenses to this area and to route 35 in general in order to provide opportunities elsewhere in the township 3

responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the township committee of the township of wall of new jersey does ordain as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the township of wall are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental service extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored causes damage in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public   1138 fire insurance claims  1161   1162 word usage  definitions 4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  4 controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase

driveways roadways and drives shall provide safe and convenient access for vehicles of occupants and visitors as well as service and emergency vehicles a hierarchy roadway design shall be consistent with a hierarchical system of functions all roadways shall be classified according to their types in making a determination as to the classification of a particular roadway the provisions of the master plan and the existing and proposed conditions in the vicinity of the development shall be considered along with the intended function of the roadway itself functional criteria for classifying roadways not specifically designated in the master plan are as follows 1 freeways this class of roadway in primarily intended to provide for movement of large volumes of traffic over long distances at high speeds with no direct access to adjacent properties 2 primary arterial roadways this class of roadway is primarily intended to form an interconnected system serving lengthy trips and linking major traffic generators they also serve as carriers of major regional traffic flows where the freeway system is incomplete or inadequate the first and most important function of arterial roadways is to carry traffic and provision of access to adjoining property is relegated to a secondary function and is minimized traffic turning onto and off of these roads can reduce capacity and access points should be restricted as much as possible with high traffic volumes and truck traffic noise levels can be disruptive to residential areas and arterial roadways should not penetrate identifiable neighborhoods 3 secondary arterial roadways this class of roadway is similar to primary arterial roadways except that they serve shorter trips and lower traffic volumes 4 collector roadways collectors differ from arterials in that they should not form an interconnected system and are generally not continuous over long distances they are intended primarily for interneighborhood traffic and as feeder roads to industrial and commercial areas some are intended to provide access to residential neighborhoods and in those cases are exclusively for that purpose they should simply carry traffic to the arterials and  140232 land use and development  140233  should not form linkages and interconnections which would accommodate unwanted this class of roadway is intended to siphon traffic from local roadways before their capacity is exceeded and the two functions of traffic movement and property access are of equal importance traffic on collector roadways should be given priority over local roadways and not interrupted by sharp turns or stop signs onstreet parking is undesirable and should be avoided where possible 5 local roadways local roadways differ from other roadways in that they are not intended to carry any whatsoever the intended function of this class of roadway is to provide direct access to adjoining properties  traffic capacity is of only secondary importance 6 driveways driveways differ from other roadways in that they connect site facilities to the local roadways the design of driveways must be adapted to accommodate a wide variety of intended facilities such as parking loading and passenger dropoff and the circulation between these various automobile facilities design speed and lane width can be reduced to severely restrict traffic speed if desired b layout roadways shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to the topography to permit efficient drainage and utility systems and to require the minimum number of roadways necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property 1 roadways shall be designed to form an overall system of public and private ways for the efficient circulation of vehicles in which every building facility parking loading or service area shall have a convenient and safe means of ingress and egress 2 all roadways shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rightsofway established on the official map andor master plan a all roadways shall be properly related to special traffic generators such as industries business districts schools places of worship and shopping centers  to population densities  and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses b roadways shall be laid out so as to discourage on local roadways to occupy no more land than is required to provide access and to avoid unnecessary fragmentation of land into smaller blocks c roadways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings and parking or loading areas so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic including pedestrian  140233 wall code  140233  d roadways shall be designed to enhance the aesthetic qualities of the roadside e the rigid rectangular gridiron roadway pattern is discouraged and the use of curvilinear roadways and ushaped roadways shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more desirable

in width h intersection of roadways roadway intersections shall link separate roadways with minimal interference of traffic flow 1 hierarchical order vehicular access between roadways should follow a hierarchical order of interconnection insofar as practical direct interconnections between dissimilar classes of roadway should be avoided and traffic from one class of roadway should be combined and controlled so as to channel traffic between different roadway classes conveniently safely and in a manner which minimizes marginal traffic friction and promotes free traffic flow in no case shall local roadways connect in such a way as to encourage their use for changes in roadway class shall occur at intersections and not along a linear roadway segment 53editors note the design criteria known
