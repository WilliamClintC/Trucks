storm water detention is a necessary part of most storm water treatment bmps and is required for most developments bthe storm water the city of cookeville is posted at the city of cookeville public works departments website and must be read by anyone attempting to perform storm water calculations with the city of cookeville it contains provisions for fees rightofentry definitions easements and penalties a major purpose of the storm water to improve water quality storm water quantity as well as comply with the citys npdes permit for discharges from small municipal separate storm sewer systems ms4 cdue to the ms4 permit requirements projects over one 1 acre in disturbed area require additional controls  therefore the guidelines are separated into two 2 categories one for projects less than one 1 disturbed acre and another for projects with more than one 1 disturbed area dstorm water detention is required for any new development or re development containing 5000 square feet or more of impervious area cookeville municipal cookeville zoning cookeville subdivision regulations where additions to the existing impervious area of the site bring the total area of impervious surface to 5000 square feet or more only the additional impervious area is required to provide detention estorm water detention is defined as limiting the peak discharge rate for the post developed conditions to be no greater than the peak discharge rate for the predevelopment conditions this must be accomplished using the two 2year five 5year and ten 10year storms the estimated design rainfall amounts for either twentyfour 24hour depths or intensities for any duration can be found by accessing the following noaa national weather service atlas 14 data for tennessee  fredevelopment of property shall be

flush runoff of impervious surfaces shall bypass the treatment facility storm water recharge by infiltrating the first flush volume into the soil on site is the preferable method of first flush treatment infiltration may be accomplished by the use of bioretention basins rain gardens bio swales green parking for overflow lots or other methods preapproved by the director of public works or his designee infiltration of the first flush may not be possible if the site is located on unsuitable soils where infiltration of storm water is not possible or ill advised treatment of the first flush is

design standards for all new construction and redevelopment disturbing one 1 acre or more must use in combination or alone storm water management measures that are designed built and maintained to infiltrate evapotranspire harvest andor use the first inch of every rainfall event preceded by seventytwo 72 hours of no measurable precipitation this first inch of rainfall must be one hundred percent 100% managed with no discharge to surface waters bstorm water management measures that are often referred to as green infrastructure that can infiltrate the first inch of rainfall are the goal that tdec is aiming for that they term runoff reduction green infrastructure includes many practices including rain gardens bioretention infiltration swales etc csome sites are not suitable for infiltration methods and infiltration requirements may be set aside on such sites with prior agreement by the public works department limitations to using runoff reduction methods include but are not

than the required minimum width 6 relation to topography the street plan of a proposed subdivision shall bear a logical relationship to the topography of the property and all streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many of the building sites as possible at or above the grade of the streets grades of streets shall conform as closely as practicable to the original topography 7 flood prevention streets that will be subject to inundation or flooding shall not be approved all streets must be located at elevations which will make them floodfree in order that portions of the subdivision will not be isolated by floods where flood conditions are anticipated profiles and elevations of streets will be required in order to determine the advisability of permitting the proposed street layout b street classifications the street and road system of the city of cookeville shall have the following classifications 1 arterial streets streets and highways that are used primarily for movement of fast or heavy traffic within and municipality  a secondary function is land access these streets are usually shown on the major street plan and are generally state and federal highways arterial

streets to the arterial streets and highways this usually includes the principal entrance streets or streets of major circulation of a residential development collector streets may be classified as major or minor depending on their traffic volumes and their relative importance in the intercity street network for construction purposes all streets intended for industrial developments andor large scale commercial developments shall be classified as major collector streets 30 cookeville subdivision regulations  2000 3 local streets streets designated to accommodate local traffic the major portion of which originates along the street itself the major function of a local street is land access these may also be called minor residential or minor commercial streets a culdesac is a local street intended to be a permanent deadend with a paved turnaround designed so that it cannot be extended in the future a marginal access street is a local street parallel and adjacent to an arterial or collector street designed to provide access to abutting land use and to provide protection from  alleys streets used primarily for service access to the back andor side of land uses otherwise on a public street c minimum street rightofway widths the minimum width of the street rightofway measured from lot line to lot line shall be as shown on the major street plan or if not shown on such plan

measured from the edge of the gutter all other classifications shall be measured from edge of pavement to edge of pavement e additional rightofway on existing streets plats for subdivisions that abut existing streets shall show the dedication of additional rightofway to meet the minimum rightofway width requirements 1 the entire rightofway shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the existing street 2 when the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street onehalf 12 of the required rightofway measured from the center line of the existing street shall be provided 3 the dedication of additional rightofway shall not be required on streets or routes maintained by the state of tennessee 4 when it can be established and demonstrated by the developer that the mandatory dedication required herein will create an unreasonable hardship the planning commission may waive or vary the requirements for the dedication of additional rightofway in general these requirements shall not be considered to create a hardship unless imposition of the full requirement will create a nonconforming lot or structure as defined by the zoning substandard existing streets the subdivision of property abutting existing streets that do not meet the minimum construction standards of these regulations shall generally be prohibited should improvements to the existing street be required in order to meet the demands of the proposed subdivision the cost of said improvements shall be borne by the developer unless determined otherwise by the city of cookeville

3 percent grade within 100 feet of any intersection with a collector or arterial street nor within 50 feet of any intersection with a local street shall be allowed 4 changes in grade every change in grade shall be connected by a vertical curve constructed so as to afford a minimum sight distance of 200 feet said sight distance being measured from the drivers eyes which are assumed to be four and onehalf 4 12 feet above the pavement surface 5 street profiles upon preliminary plat approval if the street grade appears questionable the planning commission may require a street profile drawing if required street profiles shall show natural and finished grades and shall be drawn to a scale of not less than one 1 inch equals 100 feet horizontal and one 1 inch equals ten 10 feet vertical 33 cookeville subdivision regulations  2000 h horizontal curves vertical curves and tangents 1 arterial and collector streets the geometric criteria applied to the design of an arterial or collector street is a function of the design speed defined for the given classification therefore the accepted minimum limits for horizontal curves vertical curves and tangents are also a function of design speed in general the following design speeds will apply for arterial and collector streets within the city of cookeville a arterial streets45 mph b collector streets30 mph these stated design speeds may be varied by the public works department when physical features such as topography or existing land use impact the location or configuration of a specific street however for the purpose of these regulations these design speeds shall be used to determine the minimum acceptable limits for horizontal curves vertical curves and tangents said limits shall be determined according to the methodology in a policy on geometric design of highways and streets aashto current edition or any subsequent nonmetric editions 2 local streets the minimum horizontal curve vertical curve and tangent for local streets shall be as follows a horizontal curve150 foot radius b vertical curve200 foot sight distance c tangent160 feet i intersections 1 design street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles

development usually involves the clustering of dwelling units on certain portions of the site and generally includes common open space property owned and maintained by a property owners association it is an environmentally sound concept because it can allow for development in the most suitable areas while preventing development in unsuitable areas such as flood plains or areas with steep slopes also it is an economically sound concept because it can reduce the costs for infrastructure the length of street and utility lines can be significantly decreased the cookeville zoning for two 2 types of planned unit development districts 1 prdplanned residential district and 2 pcdplanned commercial district these zoning districts allow for the mixture of land uses such as traditional singlefamily
