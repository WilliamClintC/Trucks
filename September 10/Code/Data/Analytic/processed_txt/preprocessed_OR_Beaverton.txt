property is sufficient to justify the public burden of paying the required compensation taking into consideration the citys financial resources for the payment of such claims the city council may deny

property is sufficient to justify the public burden of paying some of the required compensation taking into consideration the citys financial resources for the payment of such claims but that other of the public benefits are not sufficient to justify the public burden of paying the balance of the required compensation if so the city council may grant a waiver of the regulation to the limited extent necessary to avoid the owner being entitled to compensation as to that part of the specified regulation providing public benefit and identify a specified amount of compensation to be paid as to that

commitment to the communitys appearance quality pedestrian environment and aesthetic quality it is intended that monotonous drab unsightly dreary and inharmonious development will be discouraged design review is also intended to conserve the citys natural amenities and visual character by ensuring that proposals are properly related to their sites and to their surroundings by encouraging compatible and complementary development to achieve this purpose the design review process is divided into two major components  design standards and design guidelines both standards and guidelines implement design principles which are more general statements that guide development of the built environment the design standards are intended to provide a safe harbor approach to designing a project depending on the design thresholds designing a project to the standards would result in an administrative review process however the applicant may elect to bypass design review under the design standards and go straight to design review under the design guidelines where review is subject to a public hearing at the applicants option ord 4584  june 2012 an applicant for design review approval can address design review requirements combination of satisfying certain design standards and in instances where it elects not to utilize design standards satisfy applicable design guidelines in such a case the public hearing and decision will focus on whether or not the project satisfies the requirements of the applicable design guidelines only because the design standards are a safe harbor there is no penalty for not meeting the design standards rather the public hearing process would be required to consider the project by relying solely on the design guidelines which correspond to the design standards but are intended to allow more flexibility and originality design guidelines are also intended to recognize unique circumstances where corresponding standards are found to be unnecessary or undesirable where design guidelines apply the project proponent will simply be required to demonstrate how the project meets these guidelines at a public hearing the decision making authority must

that collocation special requirements wireless communication facilities sr  293  1 is not always feasible for technical or business reasons however if all licensed providers are made aware of any pending tower or antenna permit requests such disclosure will allow providers to have the maximum amount of time to consider possible collocation opportunities and will also assure the city that all
