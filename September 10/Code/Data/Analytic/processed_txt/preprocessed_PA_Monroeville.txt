time of concentration for stormwater runoff flowing from the development site if the postdevelopment peak runoff rate and the runoff volume are less than or equal to the predevelopment peak runoff rate and volume then additional stormwater control shall not be required at the outfall if the postdevelopment peak runoff rate and volume are greater than the predevelopment peak runoff rate and volume then stormwater detention will be required and the capacity of the detention facility must be calculated in the manner prescribed below the disturbed area used to generate the predevelopment

site to determine the maximum allowable release rate from any detention facility for the four prescribed storm events  design the outlet control facilities and size the volume of the detention facility using the calculated postdevelopment hydrograph and accepted hydrograph routing procedures in consideration of the maximum allowable release rate all detention structures shall have a 10% sediment storage volume allowance applied to the maximum required storage calculated from the routed storm events amended 4122005 by   the use of any gravelfilled detention structure is prohibited because future inspection and maintenance of this type of facility is not practical this is not intended to discourage the use of gravel infiltration facilities intended to reduce the volume of stormwater runoff added 4122005 by  5 noharm evaluation a an applicant may seek to exceed the otherwise applicable subarea release rate percentage by performing the noharm evaluation this evaluation requires an independent engineering analysis to demonstrate that other reasonable options exist to prevent the occurrence of increased stormwater runoff discharge rates andor velocities or that measures can be provided to prevent increased stormwater discharge rates andor velocities from increasing flood elevations and accelerating erosion at all downstream points in the watershed b a noharm evaluation will be considered only in instances where the discharge to a stream channel from the development occurs properly sized and designed regional stormwater detention facility c the analysis
