2446 intent a there is no control in the village of east syracuse governing the activities of those persons engaged in the business of buying and selling secondhand merchandise some of these dealers represent to those persons involved in crime an opportunity to dispose of stolen property if the law enforcement agencies are to function a local law regulating these secondhand establishments is necessary b the ease with which some secondhand dealers buy and dispose of personal property indicates the need for the enactment of laws to control and regulate their everyday business transactions a few of the dealers require scant or very often no identification when purchasing personal property and rarely if ever is proof of ownership requested c it is a fact that secondhand dealers are not required at the present time to forward reports of acquired used property to any police agencies with the passage of this article reports would be required from dealers in secondhand jewelry marine equipment antiques cameras coins stamps musical instruments firearms and televisions as well as stereophonic equipment as a result of the reporting there would be a marked increase in the number of restitutions for the sole reason that now these merchants would be committed to keeping accurate records of the used property purchased and disposed of by forwarding the proper reports to the police on a daily basis at the close of each business day d this problem involving stolen property is not confined solely to the small dealers some of the very largest retailers in the nation buy large quantities of old gold jewelry and diamond and forward not one single report of purchase to any police agency in the county the scope for the exploitation of stolen property is further broadened due to the operations of these merchandising giants e for small or large business enterprises to be allowed to continue to operate without laws to control and regulate the purchase of secondhand articles not only jeopardizes the property rights of many people but extremely hampers the police agencies in their efforts to recover stolen property and identify suspects a the security involved in the handling of secondhand property has become a matter of concern to the police agencies charged with the duty and responsibility therein the increase in the incident of property thefts the widespread use of alcohol and drugs the decline in the value of the dollar the increase in price of gold and diamonds and the specter of inflation where barter becomes more a reality all point to the imperative that the best interests of the people of the village of east syracuse would be served by the enactment of this article b this article will ensure a dramatic rise in the percentage of the stolen property recovered an increase in the probability that the general public will receive a fairer deal in their business transactions and will better the means to allow the police  2445 pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers  2446   2447 definitions as used in this article the following terms shall have the meanings indicated dealer in secondhand articlesany person who in any way as principal broker or

applicability  exemptions a findings of fact it is hereby determined that 1 land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  2 this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  3 clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  4 improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation  5 impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow  6 substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality  7 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  8 the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety  and 9 regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development b purpose the purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing within this jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in hereof this article seeks to meet

stormwater runoff from land development activities in order to reduce flooding siltation increases in stream temperature and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels  4 minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land development activities which would otherwise degrade local water quality  5 minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to the maximum extent practicable  6 reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution wherever
