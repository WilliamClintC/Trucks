chapter is to protect the safety and welfare of the general public and improve the quality of life and economic vitality of the city by imposing reasonable time place and manner restrictions on aggressive and intrusive solicitation while respecting the constitutional rights of free speech for all citizens the purpose of this chapter is to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of solicitation that have become an unwelcome presence in the city  2015  findings the city council finds that a aggressive and intrusive solicitation typically includes approaching or following pedestrians the use of abusive language repeated requests to the same person unwanted physical contact or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic an increase in aggressive solicitation in the city has become disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses and has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of places open to the public but has also the potential to create an enhanced sense of fear intimidation coercion and disorder b solicitation from people in places where they are a captive audience in which it is difficult or impossible for them to exercise their own right to decline or avoid solicitation from others is problematic and presents a risk to the health safety and welfare of the public such places include atms  vehicles in the public rightofway  near driveways leading to a shopping center  gasoline stations  public transportation vehicles and their designated locations for stops  parking structures  parking lots after dark  outdoor restaurant seating  schools parks playgrounds and recreation centers  and public restrooms c the presence of individuals who solicit money from persons at or near banks or atms is especially threatening and dangerous such activity often carries with it an implicit threat to both person and property d solicitation of drivers or vehicle occupants in the public roadway is unsafe and hazardous for solicitors drivers pedestrians and the general public solicitation on roadway median strips at traffic intersections and in the public roadway increases the risk of drivers becoming distracted from their primary duty to watch traffic which may result in automobile accidents congestion and blockage of streets and delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel all of which constitute substantial traffic safety problems e the practice of solicitation near driveways accessing shopping centers retail and business establishments is unsafe and hazardous for solicitors drivers pedestrians and the general public the location of the solicitor near the driveway compromises the solicitors safety impedes visibility and impairs a drivers ability to safely enter and exit drivers also become distracted from their duty to watch traffic that may result in automobile accidents congestion and blockage of streets and delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel all of which constitute substantial traffic safety problems f solicitation in isolated places can be particularly intimidating because the person being approached may feel vulnerable to undue coercion examples include parking structures or parking lots after dark g the city wishes to protect those who may be particularly vulnerable to intimidation such as youth near schools parks playgrounds and recreation centers h this law is timely and appropriate because current laws and city regulations are insufficient to address the problems cited above  2015  definitions in this

origin of their wastewater discharge industrial users may be required to supply such information and data concerning their processes including discharge samples and wastes generated as may be necessary for the director to determine whether such user should be designated as class a b c or d a class a users are industrial users that are regulated by federal categorical pretreatment standards industrial users may be classified as class a based on the unusual wastewater constituents and characteristics due to its volume strength composition or its derivation from a hazardous waste or substance or the potential variability in wastewater constituents and characteristics or on the potential for increased administrative cost to the city b class b users are industrial users that discharge more than twentyfive thousand gallons of wastewater to the city sanitary sewer as a daily average or have the potential to discharge toxic pollutants and must meet the pollutant limitations set by the standard specifications for wastewater discharge limitations the determination of a class b user may be based on whether the waste discharge has hazardous pollutants or whether the discharge is subject to federal pretreatment standards or whether it has in its untreated wastewater pollutants which are in excess of any pretreatment requirement or whether it may in the opinion of the director have a significant impact either singularly or in combination with other contributing industries on the citys ability to meet the objectives of this chapter c class c users are industrial users that discharge conventional pollutant loads but could by themselves or combined with flow from another industry overload the wastewater treatment plant causing the plant to violate npdes permit limits the determination of a class c user may be based on the issue of whether the user stores andor uses hazardous substances in such quantities in its industrial or commercial processes as may in the determination of the director have the potential to be discharged to the sewerage system by accident or slug discharge causing a measurable increase in the amount of hazardous substances entering the citys facilities d class d users are users that discharge wastewater from projects not associated with normal industrial or manufacturing processes projects may include but are not limited to

construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article  2001 variance procedure  nature of variances a the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners b it is the duty of the city of brentwood to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  2001  appeal board a the city hereby creates a flood management appeal board which shall consist of the city of brentwoods chief engineer director of community development department and the city attorney in passing upon requests for variances the flood management appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this ordinance any appellants relevant material and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the contra costa county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency  2001  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles 3 and 4 of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in of this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this ordinance for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city of brentwood need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city of brentwood believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in of this chapter to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a e are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance g upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the city of brentwood may attach such conditions to the granting of

city should consider 1 the number of families on current waiting lists for assisted rental housing programs that operate in brentwood such as the programs  and 2 the probable income range of tenants living in existing apartments based on the assumption that households may ordinarily be expected to pay between onequarter and onethird of their income for housing that income range will be compared with existing income limits for the program to determine whether potential displaced tenants can be categorized as verylow low or moderate income c the vacancy rate and turnover rate in multiplefamily rental housing in the community and the extent to which the proposed conversion will create hardships a conversion may be denied based upon a lack of reasonable alternative housing opportunities d the need and demand for lowercost home ownership opportunities which are increased by the conversion of apartments to condominiums e the current and historical vacancy rate in the project in evaluation of the current vacancy level under this subsection the increase in rental rates for each unit over the preceding five years and the average monthly vacancy rate for the project over the preceding two years shall be considered if the planning commission determines that vacancies in the project have been increased or encouraged for the purpose of preparing the project for conversion it may

applications will be processed in the order that completed applications are submitted a proposed project that is larger than the permitted number of units in a given year if approved will be considered to have used the permitted number of conversions for as many future years as necessary the potentially convertible rental stock will be defined as follows the number of multifamily rental units as determined by the state department of finance plus any new rental units constructed since the latest state calculation minus any units which have received tentative map approval to convert since the latest state calculation once the yearly limit has been reached a project may be approved for conversion only if the planning commission makes one or more of the following findings a the developer will provide for a significant increase in housing for verylow low and moderate income households or senior citizen households over and above the provisions of this chapter b the developer will provide for the construction of new rental housing c the developer will donate an acceptable site or an acceptable amount of funds to the city for construction of new rental or senior citizen housing d the need and demand for low cost home ownership to be provided for by the project will outweigh the detriment caused by further reduction of the rental stock c 2008  findings the planning commission may not approve an application for a residential condominium conversion unless it finds in the approving resolution that the proposed conversion meets all of the following a conforms to the requirements of this chapter  b is consistent with the brentwood general plan and current zoning regulations  c for a project of five units or more it will not cause the total amount of rental units for the current housing stock in the city to drop below fifteen percent according to the most recent census information or as shown in the citys general plan housing element housing tenure statistics whichever is most current  d the overall design and physical condition of the condominium conversion achieves a high degree of appearance quality and safety  e the conversion project is appropriate as

communications commission regulations codified in title 47 of the federal regulations seq 1 a generally requires that state and local governments may not deny and shall approve requests to collocate remove or replace transmission equipment at an existing tower or base station fcc regulations interpret the statute and create procedural rules for local review which generally preempt subjective landuse regulations limit application content requirements and provide the applicant with a deemed granted remedy when the local government fails to approve or deny the request within sixty days after submittal accounting for any tolling periods moreover whereas of the telecommunications act of 199 pub l 104104 codified in title 47 of the united states applies to only personal wireless service facilities eg cellular telephone towers and equipment a applies to all wireless facilities licensed or authorized by the fcc eg wifi satellite or microwave backhaul 2 the city council finds that the partial overlap between wireless deployments covered under a and other wireless deployments combined with the different substantive and procedural rules applicable to such deployments creates a potential for confusion that harms the public interest in both efficient wireless facilities deployment and deliberately planned community development in accordance with local values the city council further finds that a separate permit application and review process specifically designed for compliance with a contained in a chapter devoted to a will best prevent such confusion 3 accordingly the

include circumstances in which a wireless facility is installed on a pole scheduled for undergrounding  2016  limited exemptionsvariances a limited exemption for personal wireless service facilities the city council recognizes that federal law prohibits a permit denial when it would effectively prohibit the provision of personal wireless services and the applicant proposes the least intrusive means to provide such services the city council finds that due to wide variation among wireless facilities technical service objectives and changed circumstances over time a limited exemption for proposals in which strict compliance with this chapter would effectively prohibit personal wireless services serves the public interest the city council further finds that circumstances in which an effective prohibition may occur are extremely difficult to discern and that specified findings to guide the analysis promotes clarity and the citys legitimate interest in wellplanned wireless facilities deployment therefore in the event that any applicant asserts that strict compliance with any provision in this chapter as applied to a specific proposed personal wireless services facility would effectively prohibit the provision of personal wireless services the planning commission may grant a limited onetime exemption from strict compliance subject to the provisions in this subsection a 1 required findings the planning commission shall not grant any exemption unless the applicant demonstrates with clear and convincing evidence all the following a the proposed wireless facility qualifies as a personal wireless services facility as defined in united states title 47 c7cii  b the applicant has provided the city with a clearly defined technical service objective and a clearly defined potential site search area  c the applicant has provided the city with a meaningful comparative analysis that includes the factual reasons why any alternative locations or designs suggested by the city or otherwise identified in the administrative record including but not limited to potential alternatives identified at any public meeting or hearing are not technically feasible or potentially available  and d the applicant has provided the city with a meaningful comparative analysis that includes the factual reasons why the proposed location and design deviation is the least noncompliant location and design necessary to reasonably achieve the applicants reasonable technical service objectives 2 scope of exemption the planning commission shall limit its exemption to the extent to which the applicant demonstrates such exemption is necessary to reasonably achieve its reasonable technical service objectives the planning commission may adopt conditions of approval as reasonably necessary to promote the purposes in this chapter and protect the public health safety and welfare b variances all other requests to relax or waive any provision under this chapter for any
