counseling or an eap  and 3 thereafter refrains from drug use a refusing to obtain counseling or rehabilitation eap as required by the executive order after having been found to use illegal drugs b not refraining from illegal drug use after a first finding of such use all letters to propose and decide on a separation action should be worked out in consultation with the personnel administrator a because the order permits an agency to create a safe harbor for an employee who meets all three of these conditions the township has decided to create such a safe harbor and will not initiate disciplinary action against employees who satisfy the provisions of this subsection b a fundamental purpose of the township of lyndhursts drugfree workplace plan is to assist employees who themselves are seeking treatment for drug use for this reason the township of lyndhurst will not initiate disciplinary action against any employee who meets all three of these conditions 1 voluntarily identifies himherself as a user of illegal drugs prior to being identified by other means  2 obtains counseling or rehabilitation eap  and 3 thereafter refrains from using illegal drugs c this selfreferral option allows any employee to step forward and identify himherself as an illegal drug user for the purpose of entering a drug treatment program under the eap in stepping forward and consistent with

testing the position titles designated for random drug testing are listed in along with the criteria and procedures applied in designating such positions for drug testing including the justification for such criteria and procedures  52136 determining the testing designated position #227  i  #251  i volunteer for a drug test as a means of identification although this selfidentification test may yield a verified positive test result such result shall not subject an employee to discipline assuming the three safe harbor requirements are met d since the key to this provisions rehabilitative effectiveness is an employees willingness to admit his or her problem this provision is not available to an employee who requests protection under this provision after 1 being asked to provide a urine sample in accordance with this plan  or 2 having been found to have used illegal drugs pursuant to subsection 52129 random testing a among the factors the board of commissioners has considered in designating a testing designated position are the extent to which the township of lyndhurst has positions which 1 authorize employees to carry firearms  2 give employees access to sensitive information  3 authorize employees to engage in law enforcement  4 require employees to engage in activities affecting public health or safety b these positions are characterized by critical safety or security responsibilities the job functions associated with the positions protect life and property or law enforcement these positions are identified for random testing because they require the highest degree of trust and confidence the board of commissioners reserves the right to add or delete positions determined to be testing designated positions pursuant  52134 lyndhurst code  52136

random drug testing may obtain a deferral of testing if the employees firstline and higherlevel supervisors concur that a compelling need necessitates a deferral on the grounds that the employee is to the criteria established in the executive order and this plan moreover the board of commissioners has determined pursuant to 42 usc  290ee1b 2 b that all positions which have been or will be designated as testing designated positions under this plan are sensitive positions and are therefore exempted from coverage under 42 usc  290ee1b a ensure that the means of random selection remains confidential  and b evaluate periodically whether the numbers of employees tested and the frequency with which those tests will be administered satisfy the township of lyndhursts duty to achieve a drugfree work force the number of sensitive employees occupying testing designated positions and the frequency with which random tests will be administered are specified in a in a leave status sick administrative or leave without pay  or b in official travel status away from the test site or is about to embark on official travel scheduled prior to testing notification an employee whose random drug test is deferred will be subject to an unannounced test within the following 60 days reasonable suspicion testing  52136 general  52140   52140 grounds #227  i  #251  i reasonable suspicion

lyndhurst move beyond fixing environmental ills to preventing the ills before they can do harm c analysis of alternatives 1 a thorough analysis of a wide range of alternatives will be explored in order to present the public with different effects of different options considering shortterm versus longterm effects or costs and evaluating and comparing the adverse or potentially adverse effects of each option noting options with fewer potential hazards  22910 general  22102  2 using the best available science the precautionary principle requires the selection of the alternative that presents the least potential threat to human health and the townships natural resources fundamental questions to be asked include is this potentially hazardous activity necessary  what less hazardous options are available  and how much harm can we avoid d protective action 1 by using the precautionary principle the burden of proof will be shifted from the public to the proponent of a technology where threats of serious or irreversible damage to people or nature exist lack of full scientific certainty about cause and effect shall not be viewed as sufficient reason for the township to postpone measures to prevent the degradation of the environment or protect the health of its citizens any gaps in scientific data will not prevent protective action being taken by the township as new scientific data become available the township will review its decisions and make adjustments when warranted 2 when there are reasonable grounds for concern the precautionary approach to decisionmaking will seek to reduce harm a anticipatory action a duty to take anticipatory action to prevent harm government business and community groups as well as the public share this responsibility b right to know the community has a right to know complete and accurate information on potential human health and environmental impacts associated with the selection the burden to supply this information lies with the proponent not with the general public c alternatives assessment an obligation exists to examine alternatives and select the alternative with the least potential impact on human health and the environment including the alternative of taking no action d full cost accounting when evaluating potential alternatives there is a duty to consider all the costs including raw materials manufacturing transportation use cleanup eventual disposal and health costs even if such costs are not reflected in the initial price short and longterm time thresholds will be considered when making decisions e transparency public participation and an open and transparent decision making process are critical to finding and selecting alternatives e preservation of environment the duty to enhance protect and preserve the townships environment rests on the shoulders of government residents citizen groups and businesses alike the  22102 lyndhurst code  22102   2211 animals prohibited conduct added 11132017
