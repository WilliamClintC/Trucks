ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that

unhealthy activities 2 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or rooms for viewing films videos or live sexually oriented entertainment such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis gonorrhea and human immunodeficiency virus hiv 3 offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions 4 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because of the

businesses where persons view sexually oriented films 6 the findings noted in subsections b1 5 hereof raise substantial governmental concerns 7 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 8 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that

assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 9 the regulation of nudity in

interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal state and local laws thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 11 requiring sufficient lighting in all sexually oriented businesses will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal sexual activity on the premises of sexually oriented businesses and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal state and local laws thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 12 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of sexually oriented businesses and by employees of such businesses will facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal state and local laws and will thereby further the substantial government interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 13 a person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually oriented business 14 barring such individuals from the management of and employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts including conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted
