they are preserved in a public access easement     distances a horizontal distances when determining distances for setbacks and structure dimensions all distances are measured along a horizontal plane from the appropriate property line edge of building structure storage area parking area or other object these distances are not measured by following the topography of the land see figure  figure  horizontal measurement b measurements are shortest distance when measuring a required distance such as the minimum distance between a structure and a lot line the measurement is made at the shortest distance between the two objects or points see figure  exceptions are stated in subsections c e and f figure  closest distance c measurements of vehicle travel areas measurement of a minimum travel distance for vehicles such as garage entrance setbacks and stacking lane distances are measured down the center of the vehicle travel area for example curving driveways and travel lanes are measured along the arc of the driveway or traffic lane see figure  figure  measuring vehicle travel areas d measurement of distance between rightsofway distance between rightsofway is measured from centerline of one rightofway to the centerline of the other rightofway e measurements involving a structure measurements involving a structure are made to the closest wall of the structure chimneys eaves

transit station when measuring distance from a bus stop the measurement is taken from the bus stop sign when measuring distance from a transit station the measurement is taken from the edge of the platform     building height a building height the height of buildings is the vertical distance above the base point shown in figures  and  the base point used is the method that yields the greater height of building methods to measure specific roof types are shown below and in figure  1 flat roof pitch is 2 in 12 or less measure to the top of the parapet or if there is no parapet to the highest point of the roof 2 mansard roof measure to the deck line 3 gabled hipped or gambrel roof measure to the midpoint of the highest gable 4 other roof shapes such as domed shed vaulted or pyramidal shapes measure to the highest point 5 stepped or terraced building measure to the highest point of any segment of the building a base point 1 is the elevation of the highest adjacent sidewalk or ground surface within a 5foot horizontal distance of the exterior wall of the building when such sidewalk or ground surface is not more than 10 feet above lowest grade see figure  b base point 2 is the elevation that is 10 feet higher than the lowest grade when the sidewalk or ground surface described in subparagraph a5a is more than 10 feet above lowest grade see figure  figure  building height roof types figure  building height base point 1 figure  building height base point 2 b measuring height of other structures the height of other structures such as flag poles and fences is the vertical distance from the ground level immediately under the structure to the top of a structure excluding exempted portions when chimneys and other objects are allowed to exceed the height of the base zone by a set amount that set amount is measured to the top of these objects special measurement provisions are also provided below 1 retaining walls and fences on top of retaining walls are measured from the ground level on the higher side of the retaining wall see figure  figure  measuring height  retaining walls 2 measuring height of decks deck height is determined by measuring from the ground to the top of the floor of the deck if there is no rail or if the rail walls are more than 50 percent open and from the ground to the top of the rails for all other situations       building facade area the area of a specific facade of a building is determined by adding the square footage of surface area of each section of wall visible from that perspective for buildings with articulated facades all of the walls are included in the total area the total area does not include any roof area see figure  figure  building facade area       lot width lot frontage and segmented lot lines a lot width is measured from the front lot line as shown in the figure below figure  lot width b lot frontage is measured along the front lot line as shown in the figure below figure  lot frontage c segmented lot lines include one or more lateral changes in direction a lateral change is measured by drawing a hypothetical straight line between opposing lot corners and measuring the horizontal distance between the hypothetical straight line and the furthest extent of the actual lot line perpendicular from the hypothetical straight line cumulative lateral changes are measured by repeating this process for each lateral change in direction and summing all the distances as shown in the figure below in the case of flag lots the pole portion of the lot is not included in the measurement of cumulative lateral changes  cumulative lateral changes are measured only between the opposing corners of the flag portion of the lot figure  segmented lot lines         setbacks a setback measurement setbacks are measured from the corresponding property line unless otherwise stated for example a side setback is measured from a side property line b setback averaging the required setback may be reduced to the average of the existing setbacks of the lots that are on both sides of the site see figure  the following rules apply in calculating the average 1 the setbacks used for the calculations must be for the same type of structure that is being averaged for example only garage entrance setbacks may be used to average a garage entrance setback and only deck setbacks may be used to average a deck setback 2 only the setbacks on the lots that abut each side of the site and are on the same street may be used setbacks across the street or along a different street may not be used 3 when one abutting lot is vacant or if the lot is a corner lot then the average is of the setback of the occupied lot and the required setback for the base zone figure  setback averaging     flag lot area the lot area of a flag lot must be provided entirely within the building site area exclusive of any access see figure  figure  lot area for flag lot width and depth the lot width and depth for a flag lot is measured at the midpoint of opposite lot lines of the flag portion of the lot see figure  figure  lot width and depth for flag front setback determination the owner or developer of a flag lot may determine the location of the front setback provided no side setback area is less than 10 feet     tree diameter tree diameter is measured in several ways a existing trees are generally measured in terms of diameter inches at a height of 45 feet above the ground the diameter may be determined by measuring the circumference of the tree trunk and dividing by 314 see figure  figure  measuring tree size for existing trees b when the trunk is at an angle or is on a slope the trunk is measured at right angles to the trunk 45 feet along the center of the trunk axis so the height is the average of the shortest and the longest sides of the trunk see figure  figure  measuring existing trees with an angle or on slopes c when the trunk branches or splits less than 45 feet from the ground the trunk is measured at the smallest circumference below the lowest branch see figure  figure  measuring split trunk tree d for multistemmed trees the size is determined by measuring all the trunks at 45 feet from the ground and adding the total diameter of the largest trunk and half the diameter of each additional trunk  see figure  a multistemmed tree has trunks that are connected above the ground and does not include individual trees growing close together or from a common root stock that do not have trunks connected above the ground figure  measuring multistemmed trees e nursery trees are measured in caliper inch which is the diameter of the trunk 6 inches above the ground or root ball for coniferous trees the tree height may also be used       floor area the total floor area of a building or structure is the sum of the floor area of all stories in the building the floor area of a story of a building or structure is measured from the outside of exterior walls and includes all stairwells ramps shafts chases and the area devoted to garages and structured parking figure  floor area of a building     floor area ratio the floor area ratio far is determined by dividing the gross floor area of all buildings or structures on a lot by the net development area of the lot figure  floor area ratio   detached accessory dwelling units a the square footage of a garage attached to a

such as a garage the floor area of the portion of the building utilized as an accessory structure is not included in the calculation of square footage for the accessory dwelling unit in this situation the square footage limits for accessory structures and for accessory dwelling units remain in effect b the height of an accessory dwelling unit is measured using the standards of if an accessory dwelling unit is located above a detached accessory structure such as a garage then the combined height of the accessory structure and the accessory dwelling unit must not exceed the maximum height for a detached accessory dwelling unit     residential density a calculating maximum number of residential units for apartment and single detached house development to calculate the maximum number of residential units per net acre divide the number of square feet in the net development area by the minimum number of square feet required for each lot or dwelling unit in the applicable base zone b calculating minimum number of residential units for apartment and single detached house development the minimum number of residential units per net acre is calculated by multiplying the maximum number of units determined in a by 80 percent c residential density for other housing types minimum and maximum residential density for cottage clusters courtyard units rowhouses and quads are provided in

adjacent to other uses c other requirements at the time a provider requests a building permit it shall demonstrate compliance to all applicable state and federal regulations including but not limited to the state building codes and faa       collocation protocol a purpose the purpose of this requirement is to create a process that will allow providers to equitable share publiclyavailable nonproprietary information among themselves with interested persons and agencies and with the city at the time the provider schedules a preapplication conference with the approval authority this collocation protocol is designed to increase the likelihood that all reasonable opportunities for collocation have been investigated and the appropriate information has been shared among providers the city recognizes that collocation is preferable where technologically feasible and visually desirable as a matter of public policy but that collocation of antennas by providers is not always feasible for technical or business reasons however if all licensed providers are made aware of any pending tower or antenna permit requests such disclosure will allow providers to have the maximum amount of time to consider possible collocation opportunities and will also assure the city that all reasonable accommodations for collocation have been investigated the code creates strong incentives for collocation because proposals for collocation qualify for a less rigorous approval process b applicability requirements for the collocation protocol apply only to new towers subject to site development review or conditional use c preapplication requirement a preapplication conference is required for all proposed freestanding towers except those in the il and ih zones which are allowed d collocation request letter requirement at the time a preapplication conference is scheduled the applicant must demonstrate that the following notice was mailed to all other wireless communication

construct a type of tower of number feet in height for the purpose of providing cellular pcs service please inform us whether your company has any existing or pending wireless facilities located within distance of the proposed facility that may be available for possible collocation opportunities please provide us with this information within 10 business days after the date of this letter your cooperation is appreciated sincerely name of preapplication applicant e applicants obligation to analyze feasibility of collocation if a response to a collocation request letter is received by an applicant indicating an opportunity for collocation on an existing tower of another provider the applicant must make a good faith effort to analyze the feasibility of collocation this analysis must be submitted with an application for a freestanding tower a good faith effort to investigate the feasibility of collocation on an existing facility will be deemed to have occurred if the applicant submits all of the following information 1 a statement from a qualified engineer indicating whether the necessary service can or cannot be provided by collocation at the potential collocation site  2 evidence that lessor of the potential collocation site either agrees or disagrees to collocation on their property  3 evidence that adequate site area exists or does not exist at the potential collocation site to accommodate ancillary equipment for the second provider and still meet all of the development standards required by the applicable chapter in  residential development standards or  nonresidential development standards  4 evidence that adequate access does or does not exist at the possible collocation site f result of collocation feasibility analysis if the applicant has provided information addressing each of the criteria in the collocation protocol will be deemed complete the applicants tower will then be allowed subject to the regulations provided in this chapter

contiguous patches of forest canopy with limited canopy openings the forest canopy designation is made based on analysis of aerial photographs as part of determining the vegetative cover status of land within the region upland habitat is as identified on the significant habitat areas map unless corrected as provided in this subsection a the only allowed corrections to the vegetative cover status of a property area as follows i to correct errors made when the vegetative status of an area was determined based on analysis of the aerial photographs used to inventory the habitat the perimeter of an area delineated as forest canopy on the metro vegetative cover map may be adjusted to more precisely indicate the dripline of the trees within the canopied area provided that no areas providing greater than 60 percent canopy crown closure are declassified from the forest canopy designation to assert such errors applicants must submit an analysis of the vegetative habitat cover on their property using the aerial photographs that were used to inventory the habitat and the definitions of the different vegetative cover types provided in table   and ii to remove tree orchards and christmas tree farms from inventoried habitat  provided however that christmas tree farms where the trees were planted prior to 1975 and have not been harvested for sale as christmas trees may not be removed from the habitat inventory b if the vegetative cover status of any area identified as upland habitat is corrected in compliance with subparagraph b2a to change the status of an area originally identified as forest canopy then such area will not be considered upland habitat unless it remains part of a forest canopy opening less than 1 acre in area completely surrounded by an area of contiguous forest canopy      n tree groves  purpose the purpose of this chapter is to implement the comprehensive plan goals and policies related to urban forestry and provide flexible standards to

available data and analysis including but not limited to the ite trip generation manual or a transportation impact study prepared by a transportation engineer licensed in the state of oregon ii if the proposed development is estimated to generate new trips the city engineer will evaluate the existing transportation facilities along each street frontage of the proposed development site for conformance with the transportation facility standards in the city engineer will also evaluate the entire development site for conformance with map b transportation network map if existing transportation facilities do not meet current standards the city engineer will identify needed improvements based on the transportation facility standards in iii if transportation facility improvements are needed the city will require construction of improvements and dedication of rightofway at the time of development unless the city determines that such exactions are not roughly proportional to the number of new trips estimated to be generated by the proposed development if the applicant disagrees with the citys proportionality determination the applicant may utilize the citys type ii appeal procedure in a de novo hearing iv the applicant may request to pay a fee in lieu of constructing the required transportation improvements as provided in b the following review process applies to a proposed development that is exempt from street frontage improvements pursuant to paragraph b2 i the city engineer will determine whether the proposed development is estimated to

determining whether any additional public rightofway is needed for future transportation improvements iii if public rightofway is needed for future transportation improvements the city will require dedication of rightofway at the time of development pursuant to subparagraph b3aiii c the following review process applies to a proposed development that triggers a transportation impact study tis as described below i a tis is required if the proposed development is estimated by the city engineer to generate more than 1000 new vehicle trips per day or impacts a state transportation facility as determined by the oregon department of transportation the applicant must pay the fee listed in the citys master fees and charges schedule for the city to conduct this study the city will not accept any development permit or land use applications for review until the tis has been completed and incorporated into the applicants development permit or land use application submittal ii the tis will evaluate the existing transportation facilities for conformance with the citys transportation facility standards including affected offsite facilities if existing transportation facilities do not meet current standards the study will identify needed improvements based on the transportation facility standards in those of any other affected road authorities if the tis determines that transportation facility improvements are needed the city will require construction of improvements and dedication of rightofway at the time of development pursuant to subparagraph b3aiii iii if the tis identifies offsite impacts from the proposed development the applicant must submit a land use application as required by paragraph c2 that complies with the provisions in paragraph c3 c land use review whether required by this title or initiated by the applicant land use review precedes development review land use review is the process whereby the applicant submits any required or applicantinitiated land

filoc if improvements to public transportation facilities are required by subparagraph b2b the applicant may request to pay a fee in lieu of constructing the required improvements the provisions of this not allow the applicant to a pay a fee in lieu of dedicating any needed public rightofway 1 filoc review criteria the city may accept a fee in lieu of constructing the required improvements when one or more of the following conditions exist a the city is actively in the process of studying or developing new design standards for one or more of the streets on which the proposed development has frontage b required improvements are not feasible due to the location of existing development or frontage improvements c required improvements are not feasible due to the inability to achieve proper design and safety standards d required improvements are part of a larger approved capital improvement project that is listed as a funded project in a local or regional capital improvement program cip and is scheduled for construction within 5 years of the citys approval of the proposed development 2 filoc findings if the city engineer determines that a fee in lieu of construction satisfies one of the criteria in paragraph d1 the city will accept a fee upon the city engineer finding that deferring construction of required improvements will not result in any of the following a safety hazards as determined by the city engineer b new and significant street drainage issues as determined by the city engineer if the city engineer cannot make such findings then the city will not accept a fee and will require construction of the required improvements 3 filoc fees if the city engineer determines that required improvements are eligible for filoc the applicant must pay the fee in lieu of constructing the required improvements unless the city determines that the fee is not roughly proportional to the number of new trips estimated to be generated by the proposed development the city engineer will determine the fee based upon an estimate to construct the required improvements using the average cost of the most recent capital improvement project itemized bid prices the applicant must pay the fee to the city prior to the issuance of any development permits a if full transportation facility improvements have been assessed with previous development on the site and the proposed development has additional impacts the city may only assess additional filoc fees when there has been a change to the citys street design standards b if partial transportation facility improvements have been assessed with previous development on the site and the proposed development has additional impacts the city may assess additional filoc fees for the balance of the improvements c if the applicant pays a fee in lieu of constructing the required improvements and is issued a development permit by the city but does not develop as planned the applicant may request a refund of the filoc fee within 3 years of payment any refunds are subject to the approval of the city engineer 4 filoc program administration fees collected by the city will be used to construct public transportation facilities or to leverage additional grant money for larger transportation projects an accounting of fees collected and expended will be made available by the city to the public on an annual basis at

purpose a purpose 1 the purpose of this chapter is to implement the vision concepts and principles contained in the washington square regional center plan and the recommendations contained in the phase ii implementation plan summary report prepared by a task force appointed by the city of tigard 2 metros regional urban growth management functional plan target growth capacity for the washington square regional center will be met by allowing mixeduse development within the regional center at densities appropriate for an urban center 3 a mixeduse regional center will contain a variety of districts that vary in scale predominant use and character distinct districts connected to each other and to the rest of the region by a multimodal transportation system will provide a range of working living and shopping opportunities 4 improved multimodal transportation links higher densities variety of land uses and enhanced environmental qualities will all contribute to create a desirable livable community in the face of dramatic population and employment growth 5 new mixeduse zoning districts along with existing residential zoning districts in established areas are appropriate for the regional center b design principles design standards for public street improvements and for new development and renovation projects have been prepared for the washington square regional center plan district these design standards address several important guiding principles adopted for the washington square regional center plan district including creating a highquality mixeduse area providing a convenient pedestrian and bikeway system and utilizing streetscape to create a highquality image for the area c development conformance all new developments including remodeling and renovation projects resulting in new commercial uses are expected to contribute to the character and quality of the area in addition to meeting the design standards described below and other development standards required by the development and building codes developments will be required to dedicate and improve public streets  connect to public facilities such as sanitary sewer water and storm drainage  and participate in funding future transportation and public improvement projects necessary within the washington square regional center     applicability a applicability the regulations of this chapter apply to nonresidential and mixeduse development in the washington square regional center plan district the boundaries of the plan district are shown on map a located at the end of this chapter and on the official zoning map residential development in the washington square regional center plan district is subject to the standards of the applicable residential development chapter b conflicting standards the following standards apply to all nonresidential and mixeduse development located within the washington square regional center plan district within the muc mue and mur zones the standards and requirement in this chapter govern in the event of a conflict c subdistricts the subarea identified on map a has different land use and development regulations in addition to the land uses allowed in table  for the muc zone motor vehicle salesrental may be allowed as a standalone use provided all outdoor vehicle sales inventory is screened from view from adjacent public roadways by a mixture of opaque screens and evergreen landscaping and complies with all other applicable development standards       uses allowed restricted and conditional uses are those uses allowed allowed with restrictions or allowed conditionally within the muc mue1 mue2 mur1 or mur2 zones provided in table      development standards a compliance required all development must comply with all applicable development standards provided in this title except where an adjustment has been obtained in compliance with adjustments and subsections c and d b development standards development standards that apply within mixeduse zones in the washington square regional center plan district are in table  or in the development standards chapter for each housing type existing developments that do not meet the standards specified for a particular base zone may continue in existence and be altered subject to density for developments including or abutting riparian setback notwithstanding the density standards the maximum residential density and mixeduse and nonresidential floor area ratio for developments that include or abut riparian setbacks is limited to less than 110 percent of the minimum residential density and floor area ratios in all mixeduse zones except when the following are met 1 wetlands within the development are expanded or enhanced in conformance with the oregon division of state lands wetlands restoration and enhancement program and if applicable  2 fish habitat within the development is enhanced in conformance with the oregon division of state lands fish habitat enhancement program and if applicable  3 the overall flood storage capacity of the 100year floodplain within the development is increased by 10 percent if the enhancements described above are approved or if enhancements are already in existence the maximum residential density standards and no maximum floor area ratio standards for mixeduse and nonresidential developments apply d adjustments to density the density standards are designed to implement the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan these requirements apply throughout the washington square regional center plan district but the city recognizes that some sites are difficult to develop or redevelop in compliance with these requirements the adjustment process provides a mechanism by which the minimum density standards may be reduced by up to 25 percent of the original requirement if the proposed development continues to meet the intended purpose of the requirement and findings are made that all approval criteria are met adjustments provide flexibility for unusual situations and allow for alternative ways to meet the purpose of this title 1 the approval authority will approve or approve with conditions an application for an adjustment when all of the following are met a granting the adjustment will equally or better meet the purpose of the regulation to be modified  b the proposal will be consistent with the desired character of the area  c if more than one adjustment is being requested the cumulative effect of the adjustments results in a development that is still consistent with the overall purpose of the zone  and d any impacts resulting from the adjustment are mitigated to the maximum extent possible 2 adjustments are processed type i procedure as provided in along with the land use application for development that has been filed 3 adjustments are prohibited for the following items a to allow a primary or accessory use that is not allowed by the regulations  b as an exception to any restrictions on uses or development that contain the words prohibited or not allowed  c as an exception to a qualifying situation for a regulation such as zones allowed or items being limited to new development  d as an exception to a definition or classification  or e as an exception to the procedural steps of a procedure or to change assigned procedures       preexisting uses and developments preexisting dwelling units in mixeduse zones are allowed conversion of preexisting dwelling units to other uses is subject to the requirements of this chapter notwithstanding the provisions of preexisting land uses and associated development that were lawfully in existence at the effective date of the washington square regional center plan district are treated as lawful or approved uses and developments a future additions expansions or enlargements to such uses or structures will be limited to the property area and use lawfully in existence at the effective date of this chapter an addition expansion or enlargement of such lawfully preexisting uses and structures up to 20 percent of the floor area lawfully in existence at the effective date of this chapter will be allowed provided the applicant of such proposed addition expansion or enlargement demonstrates substantial compliance with all applicable development standards in this title or that the applicant demonstrates that the purposes of applicable development standards are addressed to the extent that the proposed addition expansion or enlargement allows b all additions expansions or enlargements of existing uses or structures that take place after using the 20 percent addition expansion or enlargement exception must be in compliance with the development standards of this title c if a preexisting use is destroyed by fire earthquake or other natural disaster then the use will retain its preexisting status under this provision provided it is substantially reestablished within 3 years of the date of the loss the new development must comply with this title         street connectivity a purpose the standards provide a way for creating continuity and connectivity within the washington square regional center wsrc they provide incremental street and accessway development that is consistent with wsrc needs and regional and state planning principles for connectivity the primary objective is to create a balanced connected transportation system that distributes trips within the wsrc on a variety of streets b demonstration of standards all development must demonstrate how one of the following standard options will be met adjustments to these standards may be approved as provided in adjustments 1 design option a local street spacing must provide public street connections at intervals of no more than 530 feet b bike and pedestrian connections on public easements or rightsofway must be provided at intervals of no more than 330 feet 2 performance option a local street spacing must occur at intervals of no less than 8 street intersections per mile b the shortest vehicle trip over public streets from a major building entrance to a collector or greater facility is no more than twice the straightline distance c the shortest pedestrian trip on public rightofway from a major building entrance to a collector or greater facility is no more than 15 times the straightline distance       site design standards a compliance all development must meet the following site design standards b building placement on arterials and collectors 1 purpose architecture helps define the character and quality of a street and can make a strong statement about the overall community and city at large the placement and design of buildings provides the framework for the streetscape and defines the edges of the public rightofway architecture and firststory uses can activate the street either by its design presence or by those who come and go from it at intersections investing in building frontages can create gateways and special places that add to the character of the area 2 standard buildings must occupy a minimum of 50 percent of all street frontages along arterial and collector streets buildings shall be located at public street intersections on arterial and collector streets c building setback 1 purpose buildings and investment in architecture is most conspicuous when it is visible from the street the presence of buildings closely sited at the edge of the rightofway creates an envelope for the street and a sense of permanence 2 standard the minimum and maximum building setback from public street rightsofway must be in compliance with table  d front setback design 1 purpose the front setback is the most conspicuous face of a building and requires special attention places for people and pedestrian movement helps create an active and safer street higher level of landscape anticipates a more immediate visual result 2 standard for setbacks greater than 0 feet landscaping an arcade or a hardsurfaced expansion of the pedestrian path must be provided between a structure and a public street or accessway if a building abuts more than one street the required improvements must be provided on all streets landscaping must comply with the applicable standard in hardsurfaced areas must be constructed with scored concrete or modular paving materials benches and other street furnishings are encouraged these areas may contribute to the minimum landscape area standard provided in table  e walkway connection to building entrances 1 purpose as density increases and employee and resident populations increase it is expected that more people will move between businesses within the wsrc provisions should be made to encourage people to walk from business to business and housing to business rather than use automobiles 2 standard a walkway connection is required between a buildings entrance and a public street or accessway this walkway must be at least 6 feet wide and be paved with scored concrete or modular paving materials building entrances at a corner adjacent to a public street intersection are required these areas may contribute to the minimum landscape area standard provided in table  f parking location and landscape design 1 purpose the emphasis on pedestrian access and a highquality streetscape experience requires that private parking lots that abut public streets should not be the predominant street feature where parking does abut public streets high quality landscaping should screen parking from adjacent pedestrian areas 2 standard parking for buildings or phases adjacent to public street rightsofway must be located to the side or rear of newly constructed buildings when buildings or phases are adjacent to more than one public street primary streets will be identified by the city where this requirement applies in general streets with higher functional classification will be identified as primary streets unless specific design or access factors favor another street if located on the side parking is limited to 50 percent of the primary street frontage when abutting public streets parking must be screened to the s4 standard as provided in table  all other site landscaping must be planted to the l2 standard         building design standards a compliance all new buildings constructed in the muc mue and mur zones within the wsrc must comply with the following design standards b firststory windows 1 purpose blank walls along the street frontage tend to be neglected and are not pedestrian friendly windows help keep eyes on the street that promote safety and security and can help create a lively street frontage by displaying activities and products within the building lighting at night from firststory windows also adds to the presence of activity and the sense that someone is home 2 standard all streetfacing facades within the required building setback along public streets must include windows doors or display areas on a minimum of 50 percent of the firststory facade area the firststory facade area is measured from 3 feet above grade to 9 feet above grade the entire length of the streetfacing facade up to 50 percent of the firststory window requirement may be met on an adjoining facade provided the entire requirement is located at a building corner c building facades 1 purpose straight continuous unarticulated walls lack interest character and personality the standard provides minimum criteria for creating a diverse and interesting streetscape 2 standard facades that face a public street must provide at least one of the following features at least every 50 feet a a variation in building materials  b a building offset of at least 1 foot  c a wall area that is entirely separated from other wall areas by a projection such as an arcade  or d by another design features that reflect the buildings structural system buildings greater than 300 feet in length must provide a pedestrian connection between or building d weather protection 1 purpose weather protection is encouraged to create a better yearround pedestrian environment and to provide incentive for people to walk rather than drive 2 standard weather protection for pedestrians such as awnings canopies and arcades must be provided at building entrances weather protection is encouraged along building frontages abutting a public sidewalk or a hardsurfaced expansion of a sidewalk and along building frontages between a building entrance and a public street or accessway e building materials 1 purpose high quality construction and building materials suggest a level of permanence and stature appropriate to a regional center 2 standard plain concrete block plain concrete corrugated metal plywood sheet press board or vinyl siding are prohibited as exterior finish materials foundation material may be plain concrete or plain concrete block where the foundation material is not revealed for more than 2 feet f roofs and roof lines 1 purpose roof line systems that blur the line between the roof and the walls of buildings should be avoided this standard simply states that roofing materials should be used on the roof and that wall finish materials should be use on building walls the premise is that future buildings in the wsrc should have a look of permanence and quality 2 standard except in the case of a building entrance feature roofs must be designed as an extension of the primary materials used for the building and should respect the buildings structural system and architectural style false fronts and false roofs are prohibited g roofmounted equipment 1 purpose roof top equipment if not screened properly can detract from views of adjacent properties also roofs and roofmounted equipment can be the predominant view where buildings are down slope from public streets 2 standard all roofmounted equipment must be screened to the s1 standard as provided in dishes and other communication equipment must be set back or positioned on a roof so that exposure from adjacent public streets is minimized solar heating panels are exempt from this standard         signs signs in addition to the requirements of signs the following standards must be met a residentialonly developments within the muc mue and mur zones must meet the sign requirements for residential zones as provided in   nonresidential developments within the muc zone must meet the sign requirements for the cg zone as provided in   nonresidential development within the mue zones must meet the sign requirements of the cp zone as provided in   and nonresidential development within the mur zones must meet the sign requirements of the cn zone as provided in sign area increases are prohibited b the maximum height limit for all signs except wall signs is 10 feet wall signs may not extend above the roofline of the wall on which the sign is located height increases are prohibited c freestanding signs are prohibited within required s4 screening         street and accessway standards the recommended roadway functional classification map and street crosssections in the washington

intended to provide limited flexibility for development to address the requirements of this title or innovative means   applicability a applicability this chapter applies to all proposals to adjust an existing requirement of this title all requirements such as development or design standards may be adjusted except as provided in or where specifically provided for elsewhere in this title such as in tigard triangle plan district b prohibited adjustments adjustments are prohibited in the following situations 1 to allow a primary or accessory use that is prohibited  2 to change or eliminate a

or b addresses a site constraint or unusual situation or c utilizes innovative design or results in sustainable development  2 the proposed adjustment does not have a greater impact on citydesignated sensitive lands than would otherwise occur if the adjustment was not approved  and 3 if the proposed adjustment addresses a site constraint or unusual situation utilizes innovative design or results in sustainable development any impacts from the proposed adjustment are mitigated to the extent practicable  and 4 if more than one adjustment is proposed the cumulative effect of the adjustments results in development that is generally consistent with the existing development pattern of the surrounding area and the overall purpose of the base zone b criteria for demonstrating hardship 1 application of the development standard proposed for adjustment would preclude all reasonable economic use of the property  2 the need for the proposed adjustment is the result of conditions or circumstances outside the control of the applicant or property owner  3 the proposed adjustment results in development that equally or better meets the purpose of the development standard to be modified  and 4 any impacts from the proposed adjustment are mitigated to the extent practicable    n purpose the purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures and criteria for annexations under

review process for evaluating and establishing conditional uses to ensure that they are appropriately located within the community reasonably compatible with surrounding uses and advancing the communitys vision to become a walkable healthy and inclusive city conditional uses are not allowed by right although they may serve important public and private interests conditional uses are subject to conditional use review because their size operation or characteristics require casebycase evaluation to identify and mitigate impacts to surrounding properties public facilities or the environment a conditional use approval does not constitute a zone change and is subject to any modifications conditions or restrictions deemed appropriate by the approval authority   applicability this chapter applies to all new or existing uses identified in this title as conditional uses   general provisions a conditional use approval is required to establish a new conditional use or to substantially

use where the use was not initially subject to city regulations when established but became subject to city regulations or incorporation a preexisting conditional use is the same as an approved conditional use for purposes of this chapter b a preexisting conditional use is not a nonconforming use and is therefore not subject to the provisions of nonconforming circumstances however any nonconforming development associated with a preexisting conditional use is subject to the provisions of nonconforming circumstances   discontinuation of existing conditional uses a conditional use automatically loses its conditional use status when either of the following occurs a the property owner replaces the conditional use with a use allowed by right or obtains approval to establish a different conditional use  or b the conditional use is discontinued for more than one year calculation of the oneyear period begins on the earliest date that any of the following events occurs 1 the conditional use physically vacates the location where it was approved to operate  2 the conditional use ceases to provide the service or activity that was the subject of the conditional use approval  3 the lease or contract allowing the conditional use to operate at the approved location is terminated  or 4 a final reading of the water or power meter serving the conditional use is made by the applicable utility provider   purpose the purpose of this chapter is to provide an appropriate and efficient review process for extending the time period during which land use approvals are valid and

need more flexibility than available adjustment process the benefits of flexibility to a planned development may take many forms including but not limited to the transfer of density across internal zone boundaries greater diversity of housing types and uses increased building height or increased density the planned development review process provides an opportunity for innovative creative and welldesigned developments that may be more intense than otherwise allowed by this title in exchange for developments that are thoughtfully integrated into the surrounding community and include features that benefit the public above and beyond what is generally required by this title the benefits to the public from a planned development may take many forms including but not limited to enhanced walkability or accessibility increased housing options increased open space protection of significant tree groves enhanced sensitive lands protection or restoration enhanced outdoor recreational opportunities enhanced public spaces or furnishings pedestrianscale architectural features affordable housing or sustainable features a planned development approval does not constitute a zone change and is subject to any modifications conditions or restrictions deemed appropriate by the approval authority   applicability this chapter applies to all proposed or existing planned

the project under review does not by itself provide a significant improvement to street safety or capacity  d the improvement would be in conflict with an adopted capital improvement plan  e the improvement is associated with an approved land partition on property zoned residential and the proposed land partition does not create any new streets  or f additional planning work is required to define the appropriate design standards for the street and the application is for a project which would contribute only a minor portion of the anticipated future traffic on the street 6 the standards

the primary objective in establishing the road or street for public use  or b the tract in which the road or street is to be dedicated is an isolated ownership of 1 acre or less and such dedication is recommended by the commission to the council based on a finding that the proposal is not an attempt to evade the provisions of this title governing the control of subdivisions or partitions c the

clear and present danger to the public health safety and general welfare 2 direct individual access to arterial or collector streets from single detached house lots is discouraged direct access to collector or arterial streets will be considered only if there is no practical alternative way to access the site if direct access is allowed by the city the applicant will be required to mitigate for any safety or neighborhood traffic management ntm impacts deemed applicable by the city engineer this may include but will not be limited to the construction of a vehicle turnaround on the site to eliminate the need for a vehicle to back out onto the roadway 3 the design of the service drive or drives must not require or facilitate the backward movement or other maneuvering of a vehicle within a street other than an alley single detached houses are exempt from this requirement i access management 1 an access report must be submitted with all new development that verifies design of driveways and streets are safe by meeting adequate stacking needs sight distance and deceleration standards as set by odot washington county the city and aashto depending on jurisdiction of facility 2 driveways must not be placed in the influence area of collector or arterial street intersections influence area of intersections is that area where queues of traffic commonly form on approach to an intersection the minimum driveway setback from a collector or arterial street intersection is 150 feet measured from the rightofway line of the intersecting street to the throat of the proposed driveway the setback may be greater depending upon the influence area as determined from city engineer review of a traffic impact report submitted by the applicants traffic engineer in a case where a development has less than 150 feet of street frontage the applicant must explore any option for shared access with the adjacent lot if shared access is not possible or practicable the driveway must be placed as far from the intersection as possible 3 the minimum spacing of driveways and streets along a collector is 200 feet the minimum spacing of driveways and streets along an arterial is 600 feet 4 the minimum spacing of local streets along a local street is 125 feet j minimum access requirements for residential uses 1 vehicular access and egress for residential uses must comply with the standards

must be within 50 feet of the firststory entrance or the firststory landing of a stairway ramp or elevator leading to the dwelling units 3 private residential access drives must be provided and maintained in compliance with the oregon fire access drives in excess of 150 feet in length must be provided with approved provisions for the turning around of fire apparatus by one of the following a a circular paved surface having a minimum turn radius measured from center point to outside edge of 35 feet  b a hammerheadconfigured paved surface with each leg of the hammerhead having a minimum depth of 40 feet and a minimum width of 20 feet  c the maximum cross slope of a required turnaround is 5 percent 5 vehicle turnouts providing a minimum total driveway width of 24 feet for a distance of at least 30 feet may be required so as to reduce the need for excessive vehicular backing motions in situations where two vehicles traveling in opposite directions meet on driveways in excess of 200 feet in length 6 where allowed minimum width for driveway approaches to arterials or collector streets must be at least 20 feet so as to avoid traffic turning from the street having to wait for traffic exiting the site k minimum access requirements for nonresidential uses 1 vehicle access egress and circulation for nonresidential uses must comply with the standards provided in table  table  vehicular accessegress requirements nonresidential uses required parking spaces minimum number of driveways required minimum access width minimum pavement 199 1 30 feet  24 feet  curbs required 100+ 2 30 feet  24 feet  curbs required 1 50 feet  40 feet  curbs required 2 vehicular access must be provided to nonresidential uses and be located within 50 feet of the primary firststory entrances  3 additional requirements for truck traffic may be imposed of approval of a land use application l oneway vehicular access points where a proposed parking facility indicates only oneway traffic flow on the site it must be accommodated by a specific driveway serving the facility  the entrance drive must be situated closest to oncoming traffic and the exit drive must be situated farthest from oncoming traffic m directors authority to restrict access the director has the authority to restrict access when the need to do so is dictated by one or more of the following conditions 1 to provide for increased traffic movement on congested streets and to eliminate turning movement problems the director may restrict the location of driveways on streets and require the location of driveways be placed on adjacent streets upon the finding that the proposed access would a cause or increase existing hazardous traffic conditions  or b provide inadequate access for emergency vehicles  or c cause hazardous conditions to exist that would constitute a clear and present danger to the public health safety and general welfare 2 to eliminate the need to use public streets for movements between commercial or industrial uses parking areas must be designed to connect with parking areas on adjacent properties unless not feasible the director may require access easements between properties where necessary to provide for parking area connections 3 to facilitate pedestrian and bicycle traffic access and parking area plans must provide efficient sidewalk or pathway connections as feasible between neighboring developments or land uses           clearance areas  purpose the purpose of this chapter is to establish standards that will assure proper sight distances at intersections to reduce the hazard from vehicular turning movements   applicability a applicability the provisions of this chapter apply to all development including the construction of new structures the remodeling of existing structures and to a change of use that increases the onsite parking or loading requirements or changes the access requirements b when site development review is not required where the provisions of site development review do not apply the approval authority will approve approve with conditions or deny a plan submitted under the provisions of this chapter type i procedure as provided in using the standards in this chapter     vision clearance requirements a at corners except within the mucbd zone a vision clearance area must be maintained on the corners of all property adjacent to the intersection of two streets a street and a railroad or a driveway providing access to a public or private street b obstructions prohibited a clear vision area must be maintained free of vehicles hedges plantings fences wall structures and temporary or permanent obstructions except for an occasional utility pole or tree exceeding 3 feet in height measured from the top of the curb or where no curb exists from the street center line grade trees exceeding 3 feet in height may be located in this area provided all branches below 8 feet are removed c additional topographical constraints where the crest of a hill or vertical curve conditions contribute to the obstruction of clear vision areas at a street or driveway intersection hedges plantings fences walls wall structures and temporary or permanent obstructions must be further reduced in height or eliminated to comply with the intent of the required clear vision area     computations a arterial streets the vision clearance area is not less than 35 feet on each side of the intersection b nonarterial streets 1 nonarterial streets 24 feet or more in width at all intersections of 2 nonarterial streets a nonarterial street and a driveway and a nonarterial street or driveway and railroad where at least 1 of the streets or driveways is 24 feet or more in width the vision clearance area is a triangle formed by the rightofway or property lines along such lots and a straight line joining the rightofway or property line at points that are 30 feet distance from the intersection of the rightofway line and measured along such lines see figure  figure  illustrations of vision clearance requirements 2 nonarterial streets less than 24 feet in width at all intersections of two nonarterial streets a nonarterial street and a driveway and a nonarterial street or driveway and railroad where both streets or driveways are less than 24 feet in width the vision clearance area is a triangle whose base extends 30 feet along the street rightofway line in both directions from the centerline of the accessway at the front setback line of single detached houses and 30 feet back from the property line on all other types of uses
