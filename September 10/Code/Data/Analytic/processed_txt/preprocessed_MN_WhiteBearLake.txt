and land disturbing activity can have significant adverse impacts upon local and regional water resources diminishing the quality of public health safety public and private property and natural resources of the city specifically land development and land disturbing activity can a threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing runoff volumes and peak flood flows and overburdening storm sewers drainage ways and other storm drainage systems  b diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loadings of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants  c degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing stream bed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperatures  d undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding  e alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and increasing pollutant loading  and f generate airborne particulate concentrations that are health threatening or may cause other damage to property or the environment subd 3 purpose the purpose of this ordinance is to promote preserve and enhance the natural resources within the city and protect them from adverse effects by
