district standards in the event of a conflict between a standard or requirement contained in this articles 5 and 6 of this the requirements of articles 5 and 6 shall prevail  vision and intent the intention of the town in enacting this to provide minimum standards to ensure development consistent with the comprehensive master plan  application of community design principles a the community design standards as set forth in this to be considered in every development proposal the towns goal is to expedite the planning review process by clearly outlining the towns expectations for new development b the planning commission and board of trustees will evaluate each proposal based on these standards set forth in this the context within which a project is located the standards are intended to be specific enough to guide development but not to preclude creative design solutions applicants must substantially conform to the design standards unless it can be demonstrated that an acceptable alternative meets one 1 or more of the following conditions 1 the alternative better achieves the stated intent  2 the intent will not be achieved by application of the standards in this circumstance  3 the effect of other standards will be improved by not applying a specific standard  andor 4 strict application or unique site features make the standard impractical  design elements one 1 of the greatest challenges facing small towns is the successful integration of new development with the original town pattern suburban development patterns which have included numerous culdesacs and limited street connections have often separated communities and created enclaves of the original towns in order to maintain the towns unique smalltown character and clearly describe the towns vision the following design elements are set forth 1 compact urban growth as the community grows from the original town limits it is important to maintain a continuity of density diversity and interconnectedness urban development should occur adjacent to the towns core so that the communitys prime agricultural land and natural areas are preserved and public infrastructure and utilities are used as efficiently as possible 2 neighborhood design new developments should help create neighborhoods rather than residential subdivisions adjacent to one another neighborhoods should be organized around a strong center which may include elements such as common open space civic and commercial or mixed uses strong consideration should be given to pedestrian movement the character of streets and sidewalks as inviting public space and the interconnectedness of the streets within the neighborhood and as they connect to the rest of the community in addition new neighborhoods should have a variety of housing sizes and types that help to create a distinct identity rather than a monotonous replication of styles 3 blocks streets and sidewalks the layout of lots and blocks should be designed to continue the towns existing block pattern to form a grid or modified grid pattern that is adapted to the topography natural features and environmental considerations the streets should be interconnected in order to create a comprehensive transportation network that facilitates the movement of pedestrians cars and bicycles 4 parks and open space new developments shall use natural open spaces and developed public space such as parks and plazas to organize and focus lots blocks and circulation patterns protect natural areas and quality agricultural land and to create an identity for each neighborhood 5 site design architecture and landscaping one 1 of the fundamental intentions of this to encourage innovative quality site design architecture and landscaping in order to create new places that can be integrated with the existing community and reflect the traditional patterns of the region 6 environment new developments should be designed to fit within the environment to the greatest extent feasible sites should be designed to preserve natural areas and the plants and wildlife inhabiting those areas in addition new developments are encouraged to conserve natural resources especially water 7 water conservation as the town and the state grow increasing pressure will be placed on the limited supply of water resources town residents have emphasized the importance of preserving the quality and quantity of water all new development is encouraged to use raw water for irrigation and to incorporate watersaving measures in building design and landscaping developments are required to use stormwater management techniques that address water quality as well as quantity  compact urban growth the comprehensive master plan includes a compact urban growth policy that encourages and directs development to take place within areas contiguous to existing development in the community this policy will accomplish several goals including 1 improving air quality by reducing vehicle miles traveled and by promoting alternatives to the private automobile  2 preserving natural areas and features particularly in the periphery of the town  3 making possible the efficient use of existing infrastructure and cost effective extensions of new services  4 encouraging infill development and reinvestment in builtup areas of the town  and 5 promoting physical separation from neighboring communities to help each maintain its individual identity and character  growth boundary the town has established a growth management boundary and a planned growth boundary as part of the comprehensive master plan the purpose is to direct growth within the established growth boundaries no development shall be approved unless it is located within the established planning boundaries and is consistent with the comprehensive master plan  neighborhood design principles to encourage the creation of viable neighborhoods that interconnect with each other and integrate new projects into the existing community thereby strengthening the original town the neighborhood layout should consider the street lot and block pattern of the original town as well as solar orientation topography sensitive wildlife and vegetation drainage patterns and environmental and regional climate issues further the edges of neighborhoods should be formed by features shared with adjacent neighborhoods such as major streets changes in street pattern greenways or natural features such as streams and major drainage or riparian corridors new streets bikeways sidewalks paths and trails should connect to existing adjacent neighborhoods  neighborhood structure the following is a summary of essential elements to consider integrating into new neighborhoods 1 street sidewalk and trail connections within new neighborhoods that connect to adjacent existing neighborhoods and strengthen the connection to the existing town 2 streets that encourage pedestrian activity by creating an inviting atmosphere to the details of landscaping and tree locations sidewalks lighting and the building architecture etc 3 a mixeduse neighborhood center located for easy access 4 a variety of housing types sizes densities and price ranges that are well integrated 5 a variety of land uses that are well integrated and a transition of intensity nonresidential uses larger buildings and attached multifamily housing should be encouraged to be located near commercial centers with a transition to smaller buildings closer to low density neighborhoods 6 pedestrian and bike connections throughout residential neighborhoods and linked to neighborhood commercial or civic centers and open space systems 7 parks open space public plaza and greens that are well integrated into the neighborhood 8 street trees subject to water conservation considerations 9 architectural landscaping and site design elements of new developments as outlined in this  neighborhood  general provisions the following principles are contained in the original old town of the town the comprehensive plan identifies them as contributing to the towns smalltown character although the size of individual development proposals will vary projects will be evaluated with consideration to these neighborhood design principles and the context within which a project is located failure to incorporate these design principles into a project may be cause for denial of the project by the board of trustees 1 each neighborhood has a center and an edge it is important that every neighborhood have activity centers that draw people together use natural and manmade features such as a drainage ways major roadways and ditches to define neighborhood edges buildings or other features located at gateways entering a neighborhood shall mark the transition into and out of the neighborhood in a distinct fashion using massing additional height contrasting materials andor architectural embellishments to obtain this effect 2 mix of types of dwelling units a mix of dwelling unit types shall be distributed throughout the development 3 focal points focal points or points of visual termination shall generally be occupied by more prominent monumental buildings and structures that employ enhanced height massing distinctive architectural treatments or other distinguishing features as well as

and easily accessible and shall be designed to organize the placement of buildings to create an identity for each neighborhood buildings should face public open space to allow for casual surveillance 5 design streets as public spaces a buildings shall define streets use of relatively uniform setbacks along each block subject to water use considerations the streetscape shall also be reinforced by lines of shade trees planted in the rightofway landscape strip and may be further reinforced by walls hedges landscaping or fences which define front yards b on a lot with multiple buildings those located on the interior of the site shall relate to one another both functionally and visually a building complex may be organized around features such as courtyards greens or quadrangles which encourage pedestrian activity and incidental social interaction smaller individualized groupings of buildings are encouraged buildings shall be located to allow for adequate fire and emergency access 6 order rather than repetition the orderly arrangement of design elements can unify a space even when the elements are not the same the location of sidewalks relative to streets building setbacks and orientation and the placement of trees subject to water use considerations can all help create an overall impression of unity even though each home or building has a distinct character 7 use human proportion buildings shall be considered in terms of their relationship to the height and massing of adjacent buildings as well as in relation to the human scale in a small town this means generally one two and threestory buildings 8 define the transition between the public and private realm buildings shall be located to front towards and relate to public streets or parks both functionally and visually to the greatest extent possible wherever possible buildings shall not be oriented to front towards a parking lot 9 encourage walking and bicycling sites shall be designed to minimize conflicts between vehicles bicycles and pedestrians pedestrian and bicycle access and connections shall be designed to enhance transportation on foot and by bicycle 10 neighborhoods shall have a mix of activities available rather than a purely residential land use neighborhood residents shall have convenient access to parks schools open space trails and services the optimum size of a neighborhood is onequarter 14 mile from center to edge 11 fit within the environment rather than on top of it new developments shall be designed to respond to the natural environment fit into the setting and protect scenic view corridors key design considerations shall include a site layout that responds to natural features both on and offsite the size of structures and materials used in the development and the transition between the development and the surrounding landscape 12 housing types and styles that reflect the architecture of the region familiar architectural styles shall play an important role in developing an architectural identity for neighborhood dwellings  blocks the intent of the block and lot standards is to continue the towns existing block pattern in a manner that is compatible with sitespecific environmental conditions  blocks  general provisions streets shall be designed in accordance with this the towns design standards to create blocks that consider interconnectedness topography solar orientation views and other design features the length of blocks in old town is typically four hundred 400 feet thus to the greatest extent possible blocks shall be designed to have a
