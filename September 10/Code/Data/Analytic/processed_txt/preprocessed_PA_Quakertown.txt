considered to be the difference between the stock option price and the fair market value of the stock at the time the option is exercised example there is basis under the local tax enabling act for taxing the earnings component of stock option plans stock option plans have an earnings component namely the difference between the option price and the fair market value of the stock when the option is exercised the difference the earnings component is to be reported on the taxpayers w2 form and is taxable for local earned income compensation tax purposes upon the exercise of the stock option the pennsylvania supreme court in its  decision in the marchlen case makes no distinction between qualified and nonqualified stock option plans the case site is louis thomas marchlen appellee vs the township of mt lebanon al no 7 wd appeal docket 1998 707 a2nd 631 pa cmwlth 1998  205 administration and government  205  at the time that the stock options in this case were granted to appellee they could not be exercised this does not imply that the stock options have no value at the time they are granted stock options are valuable inducements to attract and retain employees and to compensate them for their services the holder of a stock option can reap the benefits of stock price increases without bearing the risks of stock price declines however at the time the stock option is granted its value is purely speculative for should the fair market value of the stock drop below the purchase price of the option the exercise of the option on or after its maturity date would result in a loss to the holder of the option  ie the option would be worthless in contrast should the fair market value of the stock rise above the purchase price of the option the exercise of the option on or after its maturity date would result in a gain to the holder of the option further the holder of the stock option may well choose not to exercise the option thus it is not that stock options have no value at the time they are granted rather the value of the stock option is speculative and not readily ascertainable until exercised it is precisely for this reason that the taxing authority must wait until the exercise of the stock option to compute the associated tax liability emphasis added this says nothing about qualified vs nonqualified plans this says that all stock options without differentiation are taxable when exercised it makes no difference whether the plans are qualified or not the only limitation imposed by marchlen is    that the taxing authority must wait until the exercise of the stock option to compute the associated tax liability employers have the obligation to withhold the local earned income compensation tax on the earnings component of the stock options at the time the options are exercised employers should also report the earnings component as part of the local wages total on the employees w2 form k payments accruing from employment including but

b where the sole store or office is in the borough of quakertown a nonresident who maintains his or her sole store or office in the taxing jurisdiction and transacts business both within and outside the taxing jurisdiction is not entitled to an allocation of his or her net profits the business status in such instances is considered transacted as flowing municipalitytaxing jurisdictions store or office example a nonresident surgeon who maintains an office within the taxing jurisdiction and no other office outside the taxing jurisdiction would not be permitted to allocate the tax as to fees received for surgery actually performed outside the taxing jurisdiction the same example would apply to an attorney who maintains his or her sole office within the municipality c when a nonresident is entitled to an allocation of net profits a nonresident who in addition to having a place of business or office within the taxing jurisdiction also maintains a place of business or office outside the taxing jurisdiction shall be entitled to an allocation of his or her net profits such allocation is subject to the approval of the tax administrator and shall only be considered if sufficient proof is provided that the place of business or office outside the taxing jurisdiction is an established selfsustaining bona fide branch office or store 5 methods of allocation a special allocation formula where it is impossible to allocate with certainty the net profits subject to the tax by reason of the absence of a place of business or office within the taxing jurisdiction or because the nonresident taxpayers records do not disclose a breakdown of the actual net profits earned within the taxing jurisdiction or for any other reason the tax administrator upon request may permit the use of a special allocation formula to effect a fair and proper apportionment so that only that portion of the net profits attributable to the taxing jurisdiction is included in the measure of the tax these factors are 1 real and tangible property factor the taxpayer computes a percentage on the basis of a fraction using the total average book value of all such property located within the taxing  212 administration and government  212   213 employers required to withhold 3200  213 jurisdiction as the numerator and the total average book value of all property located within and outside the taxing jurisdiction as the denominator 2 wages and salaries factor a percentage is computed on the basis of a fraction using the total amount of wages and salaries paid to employees who work in or from or are attached to places of business located within the taxing jurisdiction as the numerator and the total wages and salaries paid to all employees within and outside the taxing jurisdiction as the denominator 3 gross receipts factor a percentage is computed on the basis of a fraction using as the numerator gross receipts from sales or services attributable to the taxing jurisdiction and as the denominator all gross receipts from sales or services made within and outside the taxing jurisdiction 4 averaging the percentages obtained for the three factors described herein above are to be added together and the total thereof divided by three to obtain the average of the three percentages if the numerator andor the denominator of any fraction are zero the factor is deemed to be nonexistent and shall be omitted in calculating the average of the percentages example a average real and tangible personal property in the taxing jurisdiction $25000 average real and tangible personal property within and outside the taxing jurisdiction $100000 25% b wages and salaries in taxing jurisdiction $10000 wages and salaries within and outside the taxing jurisdiction $50000 20% c gross receipts in taxing jurisdiction $75000 gross receipts within and outside the taxing jurisdiction $300000 25% 25% + 20% + 25%   70% then 70% divided by 3 factors   23 13%  23 13% would be the allocation percentage for taxable net profits  212 quakertown code  213  1 every employer having an office factory workshop branch warehouse or other place of business located within the taxing district and who employs one

annual employee withholding data via magnetic media in such cases an employers quarterly return header shall be completed and attached as a cover sheet to transmit the data and withheld tax to the

the annual reconciliation form 512 3 every employer with 250 or more employees shall be required to submit employee quarterly and annual withholding data via acceptable magnetic media this reporting

to the borough of quakertown quarterly the annual employee withholding form w2 data shall be reported to the borough of quakertown during february of the succeeding calendar year and shall be accompanied by the annual reconciliation form 512 4 the local earned incomecompensation taxes withheld from an employees wages by an employer or business entity or a corporation shall be held in trust for the taxing jurisdiction and the tax administrator even in the event of bankruptcy these withheld tax funds shall not be considered to be part of the property of the bankrupt estate these withheld taxes shall not be commingled in the employers general cash or other operating accounts a trustee ex maleficio one who collects the earned income compensation tax as an agent for the taxing jurisdiction or the taxing jurisdictions tax administrator and fails to pay over such withheld taxes to the appointed collector for the taxing jurisdiction is a trustee ex maleficio  220 administration and government  220  example an officer of a company that fails to remit the earned incomecompensation tax withheld from the companys employees may be held personally liable for the tax withheld as a trustee ex maleficio where the officer has been active andor in control over the collection and remittance of taxes b businesses and corporations must act where such individuals are the acting and controlling officers and agents of the corporation or business and they fail to administer the trust responsibilities liabilities are imposed upon the individuals who are responsible for the performance of the trust duty example a corporation which files an employers quarterly return of tax withheld from employees or the forms w2 documenting collections from employees but does not remit the tax withheld in full to this office shall be liable for the withheld taxes as a trustee the controlling corporate officer is also liable for the tax as a trustee to the extent that this officer has failed permitted andor directed the corporation not to remit the withheld tax example an officer andor director of a corporation or business who has knowledge that the corporation has failed to remit withheld earned incomecompensation tax shall be personally liable for such tax withheld because that person did not try to prevent the corporation or business from spending its funds without first remitting the withheld tax to the income tax office c liabilities of corporations and officers where a corporation does not remit the earned incomecompensation tax withheld from its employees and is subsequently is dissolved in bankruptcy the corporate officers shall be held personally liable jointly or severally for the payment of the tax withheld example the officers are the sole owners of the shares of stock andor are the guiding force of the corporation the officers are trustees of the earned incomecompensation tax collected since they are responsible for the corporations failure to remit the withheld taxes and the resulting misappropriation of the tax funds the doctrine of separate entity of the corporation shall not defeat this offices claims for tax withheld 5 the employer or the business or the corporation shall not characterize the tax withheld from employees as simply creating a debtorcreditor relationship between the employer or business or corporation and this office as collector for the tax district or taxing jurisdiction  therefore the employer is the conduit for the employees tax payments consequently these taxes withheld are held in express trust or in constructive trust for the taxing authority and its collector of these taxes  220 quakertown code  220  6 lowest intermediate balance test libt this is a judicial test which the collector will apply to ease the burden of the beneficiary the tax collector in this case the borough of quakertown to trace the funds if or when a trustee commingles trust funds due this office with other monies in a single account the libt allows trust beneficiaries to assume that trust funds are withheld last from a commingled account therefore the lowest intermediate balance in a commingled account represents trust funds that have never been dissipated and which are reasonably identifiable the borough of quakertown will take the position that the court will keep in mind a broad policy against allowing a party to unilaterally make a trust unenforceable by commingling assets also in the event of bankruptcy filing the libt is intended to provide a method for this to demonstrate that amounts of withheld taxes wereare still in the possession of the debtor at the commencement of the case see 300227 city of farrell vs sharon steel corp  united states office  mueller industries inc  citibank na united states court of appeals third circuit no 943130  case 7 interlocking business entities a company that maintains separate payrolls for its employees on a separate checking account or general ledger system and reported to this office that it has withheld payroll taxes from its employees shall be liable for the earned income compensation tax plus interest plus penalties plus all costs of collection when the tax has not been remitted to this office example the fact that a company is closely tied to a corporation and that together the company and the corporation provide a single overall set of services does not excuse the corporation from liability for unremitted earned incomecompensation tax withheld where the entities have been kept separate for bookkeeping and operational purposes 8 responsible party a an officer or employee of a business entity including a corporation who is responsible or has the duty to collect or withhold the earned incomecompensation tax andor possesses actual or implied control over funds and tax accounts will be personally assessed for collected or withheld earned incomecompensation tax that is not remitted to this office generally the borough of quakertown will issue an assessment or file a legal action against the chief operating or financial officer andor officers of any entity including corporations if the facts of the particular case disclose that these individuals are involved in the day to day operation of the business entity and retain decision making authority over financial matters a responsible person need not be an officer of the entity managers whose duties include authority and control over financial decisions may likewise be held responsible  220 administration and government  220  b this offices process of determining the responsible person begins with the employer questionnaire andor the tax return itself borough regulations do not restrict who may sign a tax return form however it is important for the person signing the form 511 understands that act along with other factors may subject him or her to personal liability because signing the employers tax return form 511 evidences control over the funds of the entity and an active involvement in the entity this presumes the person signing the tax return to be the person responsible for the payment of the withheld tax unless the facts of each particular case do not support that inference therefore if the signatory is an officer of the entity it is likely that an assessment will be made 9 any employer who for two of the preceding four quarterly periods has failed to deduct the proper tax or any part thereof or has failed to pay over the proper amount of tax to the borough of quakertown may be required by the officer to file the return and pay the tax monthly in such cases payments of tax shall be made to the officer on or before the last day of the month succeeding the month for which the tax was withheld 10 on or before february 28 of the succeeding year every employer shall file with the officer a an annual return form 512 showing the employers name address and identification number the total number of withholding statements transmitted with the annual return the total income tax withheld from wages during the year as shown by withholding tax statements and the total income tax withheld as reported on the quarterly returns any differences between the total income tax withheld from wages as shown on the withholding statements and the total income tax withheld as reported on the quarterly returns must be fully explained in an attached note b a withholding tax statement form 525 or w2 for each employee employed during all or any part of the period beginning january 1 of the current year and ending december 31 of the current year setting forth the employees name address and social security number the amount of earned incomecompensation paid to the employee during said period the amount of tax deducted the political subdivision imposing the tax upon such employee and the amount of tax paid to the officer every employer shall furnish two copies of form 525 or at least four copies of form w2 to each employee for whom it is filed 11 every employer who discontinues business prior to the completion of taxable year shall within 30 days after the discontinuance of business file and furnish the returns required by this section covering the periods between the last such return and the discontinuance of business and remit to the officer all remaining tax due every employer engaged in a business activity within the approving political subdivision  220 quakertown code  220   221 fiscal years 3200  221  222 cash or accrual basis 3200  222 shall withhold from resident and nonresident employees who work for such employer within the approving political subdivision even though the payroll records and place of payment are not located in the approving political subdivision 12 the failure or omission of any employer to make the deductions required by this section shall not relieve any employee from the payment of the tax or from complying with the requirements of the ordinances or resolutions relating to the filing of declarations and returns 13 bad checks a charge of $25 will be levied each time a check is returned from the bank unpaid checks issued in violation of the pennsylvania crimes be referred to the appropriate authorities for possible criminal prosecution 1 normally taxpayers shall use the calendaryear method for reporting and paying the tax 2 a business taxpayer by filing with the officer his written election to do so may make and file returns and pay tax on the same fiscal year basis used for pennsylvania personal income tax purposes see  218  1 a taxpayer may calculate income on the cash or accrual basis as those terms are used for pennsylvania personal income tax purposes the basis used by the taxpayer shall be the same as used by the taxpayer for the pennsylvania personal income tax 2 illustrations of computations of net profits as amplification of the definition contained in but not a limitation thereof the following information and requirements for the determination of net business profits are furnished a cash basis method a taxpayer employing the cash basis of accounting includes in gross income all income subject to tax received during the year in cash or its equivalent he or she deducts all disbursements made during the year in cash or its equivalent provided deduction for such expenditures is authorized by law b the use of the cash basis is mandatory where no books or records of account are maintained c items of income and expenditure which as gross income and deduction are elements in computing taxable income need not necessarily be in the form of cash it is sufficient that such items if  220 administration and government  222  otherwise properly included in the computation can be valued in terms of money example a taxpayer on the cash basis received shares of stock in payment of services assuming that the stock has a fair market value the taxpayer has received the equivalent of cash to the extent of its value and that amount must be included as income d if a return is made on the cash basis gross profit shall include receipts from commissions fees and interest as well as the gross profit or loss from sales of merchandise chattels goods wares securities notes choosesinaction and services e accrual basis if income is taken into consideration when earned even though not received in cash and expenses are considered as soon as incurred whether paid or not the system of accounting is said to be on the accrual basis these are the basic rules i the right to receive an item of income as distinguished from actual receipt determines its inclusion in gross income under the accrual basis  and ii a deduction cannot be accrued until an actual liability is incurred example in september of last year a contractor performed work for a customer payment for this work was not received until this year if the taxpayer reports on the accrual basis the income will be included in last years return when earned if the taxpayer reports on the cash basis the payment will be included in this years return when received 3 a taxpayer engaged in more than one business activity may in computing taxable income use a different method for each trade or business activity 4 methods of accounting must clearly reflect income no method of accounting is allowed unless it clearly reflects income thus even if the taxpayers accounts are kept and the return made on the cash basis unusual cases way arise in which a payment made during the year is not deductible example commissions fees and costs paid in one year by a taxpayer in securing a loan for 10 or 15 years covered by a mortgage on property to be leased are not deductible in full in the year of payment but should be spread over the period of the loan even though the taxpayers accounts are kept and the return made on the cash basis 5 income or net profits shall be taxable in the year when they are actually or constructively received by the taxpayer income or net profits although not actually reduced to a taxpayers possession will be deemed to be constructively received by the taxpayer in the tax year during which it is credited to the taxpayers account set apart for the taxpayer or otherwise made available so that the taxpayer may draw  222 quakertown code  222   223 penalty and interest 3200  223 upon it at any time however income will not be deemed to be constructively received if the taxpayers control of its receipt is subject to substantial limitations or restrictions such as those relating to age death disability retirement or other similar factors 1 if for any reason the tax is not paid when due interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the amount of said tax and an additional penalty of 1 1 2% of the amount of the unpaid tax for each month or fraction thereof during which the tax remains unpaid shall be added and collected where suit shall be brought for recovery of any such tax the person liable therefore shall in addition be liable for the cost of collection and the interest and penalty herein imposed 2 abatement of certain interest and penalty will be considered under the following conditions a errors and delays in the case of any underpayment the income tax office may abate all or any part of interest for any period for the following 1 any underpayment of tax finally determined to be due attributable in whole or in part to any error or delay by the office in the performance of a ministerial act for the purposes of this subsection an error or delay shall be taken into account

finally determined to be due or payable 2 any payment of a tax to the extent that any error or delay in the payment is attributable to an officer employee or agent of the income tax office being erroneous or dilatory in the performance of a ministerial act the collector shall determine what constitutes timely performance of ministerial acts performed under this subsection 3 the timely performance of ministerial acts shall mean that the income tax officer shall contact the taxpayer or employer within 60 days of receiving a properly filed tax return if the officer fails to notify the taxpayer or employer of an underpayment of tax within 60 days of the receipt of a properly filed return that taxpayer or employer shall be given 30 days to satisfy the underpayment without the accrual of penalty and interest if that taxpayer or employer fails to satisfy the underpayment within 30 days penalty and interest shall be applied from the date the tax was originally due  222 administration
