communities tended to further the increase of criminal and other offensive activity to disrupt the peace and order of the communities to depreciate the value of real property to harm the economic welfare of the communities and to negatively affect the quality of life in such communities  for these reasons such secondary effects are hereby found to be detrimental to the public health safety and general welfare of citizens of the communities where such activities are allowed to occur in bars and taverns including the following detrimental effects 1 the potential increase in prostitution and other sexrelated offenses as well as other crimes and offenses 2 the potential depreciation of property values in neighborhoods where bars and taverns featuring nude dancing exist 3 health risks associated with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 4 the potential for infiltration by organized crime b purpose the council recognizes that the united states supreme court has held that nude

plantings berms and fencing that are required to eliminate or reduce existing or potential nuisances eg dirt litter noise glare signs and incompatible land uses buildings or parking areas a the required level of bufferyard opacity is listed in figure 584b detailed bufferyard requirements are listed in figure 584c opacity is a quantitatively derived measure which indicates the  584 monroe code  584 1 degree to which a particular bufferyard screens the abutting property the required level of opacity indicated is directly related to the degree to which the potential character of development differs between different zoning districts b bufferyards shall be located along and within the outer perimeter of a lot wherever two different zoning districts abut one another bufferyards shall not be required in front yards or along public street frontages c to ensure that the yearround screening objectives are fulfilled only the plant classifications in figure 585b listed as

d reduction of required bufferyard width 1 intent this subsection is intended to allow for the reduction of the required width of a required bufferyard where the presence of permanently protected green space or similar areas provides equivalent permanent screening and separation benefits as would be provided by the otherwise required bufferyard 2 where the minimum permitted width for the required bufferyard is not available under the current or proposed state of development the zoning administrator may reduce the width required for the bufferyard to that currently available on the site provided that the portion of the site that requires a bufferyard contains one or more of the following a steep slopes that contain retaining walls or riprap b permanently undevelopable green space or other permanently protected green space designated on site plans such as a native or restored prairies or park savannas wetlands bodies of water floodplains drainageways upland woods stormwater basins or other natural resource protection areas including areas protected by covenants or conversation easements 3 if permanently protected green space is located on an adjoining property adjacent to the portion of a site that requires a bufferyard the zoning administrator may reduce the width required for the bufferyard the reduction shall consist of no more than one foot for every three feet of permanently protected green space on the adjoining property as measured from the property line at a right angle into said adjacent property there shall be no reduction in the number of landscape points required  584 official city code  584 1 e use of required bufferyard and landscaped areas 1 any and all required bufferyards or landscaped areas may be used for passive recreation

yards or bufferyards shall not be used to meet another requirement 7 measurement and calculation a landscaping point values shall be doubled for mature existing landscape plantings that are retained and protected with the development of the site existing plantings eligible for double point values shall be determined by the zoning administrator b in calculating the number of required landscaping points under the provisions of this chapter all areas and distances on which required calculations are based shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number of square feet or linear feet c any partial plant derived from the required calculations of this chapter for example 233 shade trees shall be rounded up to the next whole plant for example 24 shade trees 8 utility easements landscaping materials fences and berms located within a duly recorded utility stormwater or a pedestrian easement shall not count toward meeting a landscaping requirement unless authorized otherwise by the city and the easement holder the width of such areas may be counted as part of a landscaping width requirement for bufferyards  584 monroe code  584 1 9 other green space areas green space areas not used for landscape plantings other than natural resource protection areas shall be graded and seeded or sodded with an acceptable maintainable seed mix restored to native vegetation mulch of plantings or planting beds is acceptable provided that such mulching consists of organic or natural materials mulches shall be installed so that they will not erode fall be plowed or otherwise transported into

purpose of this section is to assign responsibility for the official interpretation of the provisions of this title 5 and to describe the required procedure for securing such interpretation 2 initiation of request for an interpretation proceedings for an interpretation may be initiated by any of the following four methods a an application of the owners of the subject property or authorized agent of the owners of the subject property b a recommendation of the plan commission to the common council c by action of the common council d by request of the zoning administrator 3 application a zoning interpretation application contains all of the following  51033 official city code  51040 1 a clear indication of the text of this title 5 for which the interpretation is requested and the specific questions the applicant has regarding said text b if the requested interpretation relates to the application of this title 5 to a specific property the additional following information may be required digital files should be submitted whenever possible 1 a map of the subject property depicting a all lands for which the interpretation is requested and all other lands within 100 feet of the boundaries of the subject property b current zoning of the subject property and its environs and the jurisdictions which maintains that control c all lot dimensions of the subject property d a graphic scale and a north arrow 2 a written description of the reason for the requested interpretation and how the proposed interpretation relates to type of activities buildings and structures currently located on and proposed for the subject property 3 a site plan of the subject property as proposed for development said site plan shall conform to the requirements of  51031 c if the requested interpretation relates to the classification or treatment of a particular land use under the provisions of this title 5 a series of written responses to the following questions 1 how is the subject land use in general harmony with the purposes goals objectives policies and standards of the citys comprehensive plan this title 5 and any other plan program or ordinance adopted or under consideration pursuant to official notice by the city 2 how is the subject land use in harmony with the purposes goals objectives policies and standards of the pertinent zoning district for which the interpretation is being sought 4 review by zoning administrator a the zoning administrator shall determine whether the application is complete and fulfills the requirements of this title 5 if the application is determined to be incomplete the zoning administrator shall notify the applicant b the zoning administrator shall review the application and evaluate and comment on the written justification for the proposed  51040 monroe code  51040 1 interpretation provided in the application to determine whether the requested variance is in harmony with the citys comprehensive plan c the zoning administrator shall forward a report indicating the interpretation of the zoning administrator to the applicant if the zoning administrator determines that the proposal may be in conflict with the provisions of the comprehensive plan the zoning administrator shall note this determination in the report 5 standards for review this chapter shall be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with the purposes intended by the common council as noted in this title 5 and the comprehensive plan the intent of the standards and supporting definitions of this title 5 is to protect both individual property owners and the general public from adverse impacts that may result from a proposed modified or existing land use to this end those called upon to interpret this title 5 shall proceed as follows a articulate certain public purposes underlying the standards for which an interpretation is required rationale before any zoning interpretation is made there must be an explicit discussion of certain purposes for which the regulation was initially imposed each zoning regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and the general public each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable potential negative impact a sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured without careful analysis of the regulation and the end toward which it is directed it is understood that there may be other public purposes underlying the interpretation which are not explicitly articulated b articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations permitting flexibility in design and prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public there is a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use and an interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use or which allows a use to be enlarged or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in the freedom is to be encouraged while a lowering of the standards of this title 5 is to be prohibited c determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected by that persons land use proposal if an interpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from the one expressly stated or permitted and if it would result in a same or greater degree of protection to any affected party ie the abutting landowners the public at large andor a future property owner or renter such an interpretation may be appropriately  51040 official city code  51040 1 made any interpretation which would result in any identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this title 5 similarly any interpretation which would either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the regulation was adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this title 5 any interpretation which will result in any reduction of a normally required bufferyard or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted shall only be made if the party interpreting this title 5 has the power to impose additional restrictions or requirements d this chapter has been carefully designed by the common council to combine maximum achievement of public goals and the protection of abutting property owners while providing flexibility for property owners to use their land for a variety of uses consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan great care has been taken to balance the rights of competing groups while achieving maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use options persons interpreting this title 5 should not substitute their own judgments for the legislative acts of the common council e in addition to the applicants response to the questions required by subsections 5a d above the following standards shall govern the decision on the requested interpretation on land use interpretation matters 1 no interpretation shall allow the establishment of any land use which was previously considered and rejected by the common council on an application for an amendment to the zoning the official zoning map or a previously applied for appeal from a requested interpretation 2 no interpretation shall permit a land use listed as a use permitted by right or a conditional use in another zoning district if the use is not listed as permitted or conditional in the zoning district of the subject property see  3 no interpretation shall permit a land use in a zoning district unless evidence is presented which demonstrates that the land use will comply with any and all regulations applicable to development in the subject propertys zoning district see  4 no interpretation shall permit a land use in a particular zoning district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in that same district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses either not permitted in said district or permitted in a more intensive district in the same zoning district category see   51040 monroe code  51040 1  51041 variances 5 if the proposed land use is more similar to a land use permitted only as a conditional use in the subject propertys district than to a use permitted by right then an interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned upon the approval of a conditional use pursuant to  51028 6 effect of a favorable land use interpretation no interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific zoning district shall authorize either the establishment of such use or the development construction reconstruction alteration or moving of any building or structure a favorable interpretation merely authorizes the preparation filing and processing of applications for any permits and approvals which may be required by this title 5 these permits and approvals include but are not limited to required site plans special use permits conditional uses and certificates of occupancy 7 limitations on favorable land use interpretation a no interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be valid for a period of more than 365 days from the date of issuance of the interpretation unless a building permit is issued and development has begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or a certificate of occupancy is obtained and a use commenced within that period b an interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be deemed to authorize only that particular use at that particular location for which the interpretation was issued the interpretation shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate interpretation has not been issued a favorable interpretation shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if the particular use for which it was issued shall for any reason be discontinued for a period of 365 consecutive days or more 1 purpose

entire neighborhood b where appropriate to the design proposed streets shall be continuous and in alignment with existing planned or platted street with which they are to connect c proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided unless prevented by the topography or other physical conditions or unless in the opinion of the city plan commission such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layouts or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts deadend streets of reasonable length normally not over 500 feet may be approved where necessitated by topography or where in the opinion of the city plan commission they are appropriate to the type of development contemplated d proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit e wherever there exists adjacent to the tract to be subdivided a dedicated or platted and recorded halfwidth street or alley the other halfwidth of such street or alley shall be platted  6313 official city code  642 1  643 arrangement of streets 4201976  2016  f alleys shall be platted in business districts to provide safe access to residential lots fronting on thoroughfares or major streets alleys shall be platted in the rear of such lots or service drives provided in front thereof alleys will not be approved in other locations in residence districts unless required by unusual topography or other exceptional conditions g lands abutting a highway or principal thoroughfare should be platted with the view of making the lots if for residential use desirable for such use by cushioning the impact of heavy traffic on such trafficways as well as the accident hazard this may be accomplished in several ways as follows 1 by platting the lots abutting such a trafficway at very generous depths and by providing vehicular access to them by either alleys or service drives in the rear or frontage access roads next to the highway connected therewith at infrequent intervals  or 2 by not fronting the lots on the highway but on a minor street paralleling the highway at a distance of a generous lot depth with private driveways connecting with such minor street  or 3 by platting a collector street more or less parallel with the highway 600 feet to 1000 feet distant therefrom from which loop streets or deadend streets extend toward the highway the ends of which give access to the lots abutting the highway to the rear selection in the specific case among the foregoing or other methods for accomplishing the purposes in view must necessarily be made in consideration of topography and other physical conditions the character of existing and contemplated developments and other pertinent factors that apply in each case h a subdivision abutting a stream or lake shall have roads at least 60 feet wide providing access to the low
