economic climate within the city and surrounding communities it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured for this reason it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the city and the surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water groundwater resources are  contained within underground reservoirs known as aquifers these aquifers are zones of rack beneath the earths surface capable of containing or producing water from a well they occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas it is therefore necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized i 3122001 definitions aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the

adopted aug 9 201 did not specify manner of inclusion hence to facilitate indexing said provisions have been codified as ch 6 art xii cross reference utilities ch 21  subdivisions and land development app a  293628 introduction it is hereby determined that land development projects and other land use conversions and their associated changes to land cover permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes which in turn increase flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition  land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters  the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety public and private property drinking water supplies recreation fish and other aquatic life property values and other uses of lands and waters  these adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas the preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged use of incentives or credits the georgia greenspace program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits  localities in the state of georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution and therefore the city of lafayette georgia city has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of postdevelopment stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation the city has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate postdevelopment stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes postconstruction soil erosion and sedimentation stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with postdevelopment stormwater runoff  general provisions a purpose and intent the purpose of this article is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new

public health safety environment and general welfare of the public and protect water and aquatic resources this article seeks to meet that purpose following objectives 1 establish decisionmaking processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources  2 require that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding streambank erosion nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3 establish minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4 establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards  5 encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable coordinate site design plans which include greenspace  6 establish provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained and pose no threat to public safety  and 7 establish

of private property are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment as such signs are entitled to the protection of the law in the absence of regulation however the number of such signs tends to proliferate with property owners desiring everincreasing numbers and sizes of signs leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares in addition the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises b regulation of the size height number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses to enhance the business and economy of the city to protect the public investment in the streets and highways to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas to promote industry and commerce to eliminate visual clutter and blight to provide an aesthetically appealing environment and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the citys citizens c the city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either control of traffic or of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going as such with the exception of signs identifying government buildings virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes moreover their use in the public rightofway is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public the city council finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations even where signs serve a proprietary purpose such as identifying markings on utility polls those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefitting the public generally of locations where there may be temporary losses of power d the city finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function for instance address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies subdivision signs at the entrances to subdivisions favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate subdivision entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls while such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this chapter the bulk of the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners 1 5122008 authority this chapter is enacted pursuant to paragraph iv of the georgia constitution

not specify manner of codification hence  inclusion of these provisions were codified as superseding former art vi  2114121145 which pertained to water conservation plan and derived from d adopted  cross reference installation of watersaving facilities  620  consumers responsibility and liability for use of city water  2114 purpose and scope this article described two 2 related policies of the city for the management of the city water system first is the drought contingency plan for temporary implementation during a water shortage emergency the second is lafayettes water conservation plan a program of policies for longrange conservation of water the purpose of lafayettes drought contingency plan plan is to provide guidelines for the city to follow in the event of water shortage emergencies the plan establishes priorities of water use and provides for allocation of available water during four 4 stages of water shortage in increasing order of severity of the shortage conditions that could cause implementation of the plan could be anything that causes a decrease in water availability from the city water facilities such as failure of one 1 or more pumps prolonged power outage control malfunction or water main breaks sudden increases in water demand because of fire emergencies excessive heat cold or drought when demand for water exceeds the citys water systems capacity action must be taken to prevent serious shortages and disruption of water service and fire protection to the customers in a growing community such as in lafayette and walker county it is probable that the growth in water demand may sometimes exceed the water systems capacity to produce water problems and delays could arise in obtaining and developing sufficient sources of water in financing and constructing needed treatment facilities pumping stations storage tanks and distribution pipes etc even with the best planning and construction it is not considered economically feasible to provide excess capacity for every possible contingency for excessive growth or for every drought while the plan is intended to deal with shortterm shortages that may occur from time to time the plan is a program of policies adopted by the city to promote longterm efficient use and conservation of the water resources available to the city and walker county thus minimizing the frequency and duration of emergency water shortages  182001 existing facilities the city operates and maintains a public water supply system serving the city and certain areas outside the corporate limits of the city the city operates a surface water plant a spring and a well which is treated package plant the city also has a contractual agreement with walker county water and sewer authority and catoosa county utilities  182001 determination of low flow conditions the city checks stream flows and spring levels on a daily basis low flow conditions among other observed conditions of the system and input from the georgia epd will trigger the decisions on the severity of the plan  182001 drought contingency plan a water use priorities a general ranking of priority water uses in decreasing order of importance are to be as follows 1 household use 2 public necessity 3 livestock 4 industry and commercial use 5 construction 6 irrigation 7 nonessential fire fighting 8 swimming pools 9 car washing 10 street cleaning line flushing hydrant testing etc b implementing the drought contingency plan implementing the plan will be contingent upon numerous interrelated factors that may cause a temporary shortage of water in general any event or series of events which disrupts or threatens to disrupt the citys water supply and distribution system will be carefully evaluated and the appropriate stage of the plan will be implemented in response in certain cases the georgia environmental protection division epd may order the plan to be implemented whether or not the city has acted c implementation stages the plan will be implemented in four 4 stages depending on the severity of the water shortage each stage has specific goals for reducing water consumption stage no 1minor water emergency the city will when minor conditions occur first put the following priority conservation methods in place under minor conditions when a request is made hereunder by the city manager compliance shall be on a voluntary basis  public service announcements will be made on local radio stations and in the newspaper requesting that customers curtail the use of unnecessary water in watering lawns and gardens washing cars and other practices that are not essential during emergency conditions  fire departments and others will be asked to curtail water main flushing dust control and other nonessential use of water stage no 2moderate water emergency if water shortages continue such that up to fifteen 15 percent to eighteen 18 percent reduction in water use is deemed necessary the city will declare a moderate water emergency condition and will take the following additional actions  make additional news releases to the news media and advise of the increased intensity of the water shortage by explaining the degree of severity of the water shortage problem and the need for additional curtailment of water use  make additional and more urgent appeals to all customers especially the significant industrial users for additional voluntary reductions of water use with a goal of eighteen 18 percent reduction  use city employees to read meters of significant industrial users to gauge the extent of their water reduction  use city employees and law enforcement agencies to monitor outdoor use of water by all customers  prohibit all outdoor use of water for car washing except at commercial facilities watering lawns garden and landscape watering pavement hosing and filling swimming pools  pm to  am  water customers observed using water in violation of stage no 2 restrictions will be warned by the city and requested to comply with the plan if after one 1 such warning and request the customer fails to comply then the customers water service will be cut off at the meter and a reconnection fee of one hundred dollars $10000 will be charged to return the customer to service if said service is cut off and then reconnected any additional violation of stage no 2 restrictions by said customer will cause the city to cut off service at the meter until emergency water shortage conditions have improved to the point where stage no 2 restrictions are lifted by the city and a reconnection fee of one hundred dollars $10000 will be charged to return the customer to service stage no 3severe water emergency in cases where up to thirty 30 percent reduction in water use is deemed necessary the city will declare a severe water emergency condition and may add the following actions  notify the news media that a severe water emergency has been declared and request cooperation in reaching all water customers with the need to further curtail water use  hand deliver letters to individual large water users outlining the severity of the problem and requesting significant voluntary curtailment of water use industrial users will be requested to reduce average consumption by at least thirty 30 percent of their normal use and advised that city employees will read water meters to monitor the level of reduction achieved  prohibit all water usage by governmental agencies not required for health and safety  prohibit all outside water usage at all times by all customers except that water use which is essential or required for health or safety  prohibit all oncewater use or watercooled airconditioners with recirculation  prohibit the escape of water or excessive leaks in plumbing facilities by cutoff of the water service of offending customers  require commercial car washing and commercial laundries to reduce water use up to fifty 50 percent of normal use as demonstrated by meter readings  if a water customer violates the stage no 3 restrictions after one 1 request is made of the customer for compliance the customers water service will be cut off and a reconnection fee of two hundred fifty dollars $25000 will be charged to return the customer to service if said service is cut off and then reconnected any other violation of stage no 3 restrictions by said customer will cause the city to cut off service at the meter until the emergency water shortage conditions have unproved to the point where stage no 3 restrictions are lifted by the city a reconnection fee of two hundred fifty dollars $25000 will be charged to return the customer to service stage no 4critical water emergency if a water shortage emergency becomes so severe that it is declared critical water emergency and a fifty 50 percent or greater reduction is deemed necessary the city will add the following additional actions  additional prohibitions will be imposed on the use of any water activities not essential or required for health and safety  after twentyfourhour notice to industrial users the flow of water to the users will be shut off or reduced to the absolute minimum necessary to protect health and safety  prohibit all water use for commercial car washing commercial laundries construction activities and irrigation for agriculture  notify all water customers that any water use greater than their average monthly use on an annual basis will be penalized by a fine of two hundred fifty dollars $25000 per month until the emergency has subsided  the city may also issue any other requirements to reduce water use in other specific ways using the priority list herein as a guide to the degree of curtailment  all city personnel will monitor unnecessary use of water and report violations of stage no 4 restrictions  upon a customers first violation of stage no 4 restrictions the customers water will be discontinued upon notification to the customer until the water shortage conditions have improved to the point where the city lifts stage no 4 restrictions a reconnection fee of five hundred dollars $50000 will be charged to return the customers service  182001 water conservation plan a management of water system losses epd guidelines recommend that system losses be reduced to ten 10 percent or less the city is currently attempting to minimize unaccounted water use and it is evident that continuing efforts will be needed to bring the water losses within acceptable limits typically water system losses are the result of system leaks line breaks unmetered sales uncalibrated or faulty meters and unmetered uses such as fire hydrant use and line flushing sometimes the water is allowed to bleed off in certain locations during cold weather to prevent freezing the following policies will be initiated by the city to ensure that the water system returns to an acceptable water loss ratio  all distribution system leaks will be repaired as quickly as possible city employees including members of fire and police departments are trained to report any water line leaks or breaks  best construction practices have been implemented hot taps on large water mains and looping dead end lines to reduce water losses due to flushing  the citys water meter maintenance program will be expanded to include checking and calibration of all large meters one and onehalf 112 in and larger and the large meters at the water sources residential meters will be automatically replaced whenever readings begin to vary unaccountably or do not register within the expected range  the city will continue to maintain monthly records reflecting the difference between water production and metered sales the city will then take additional steps to identify and eliminate the source or sources of system losses  the city water system maps showing the location and size of all lines valves and hydrants will be periodically updated as new mains are added and as information is discovered during repair or replacement operations  the city will continue to evaluate all water service meters to insure they are adequately sized for the average and peak flow rates meters that are inadequately sized will be replaced with the recommended meter sizes  the storage tanks are observed continually for evidence of overflowing automatic level controlled equipment will be kept in proper calibration by routine maintenance  the city has raw and finished water metering at all sources for water  in order to promote water conservation the city will continue to update local building codes to require all plumbing fixtures and piping in new construction be sized in accordance with the state plumbing georgia water conservation law et seq  the city will continue the current practice of metering all water services and requiring a separate meter for each dwelling unit  and the city will continue the current practice of utilizing the same uniform unit rate per one thousand 1000 gallons for all water usage above the monthly minimum no discount is given for larger water customers the rate structure is strictly on a flat basis no discount is given for irrigation water meters  182001 restriction on outdoor watering of landscape outdoor watering for purposes of planting growing managing or maintaining ground cover trees shrubs or other

land owner subdivides land and then files minor subdivision applications on common contiguous parcels which collectively total more than four 4 lots it is also the intent of the mayor and city council to prohibit minor subdivisions adjacent to each other within a threeyear time period in cases where part of an original tract of land is now owned by another person or entity and was transferred or sold to another owner with the apparent intent to circumvent the major subdivision process 2 common contiquous parcels shown on minor subdivision plats contiguous common parcels as defined by this

land that has been divided as a minor subdivision in the last three 3 years then minor subdivision of said property shall be prohibited this provision shall not be construed to prohibit the approval of two 2 contiguous minor subdivisions under separate ownership  however this provision is intended to be construed so that one property owner does not develop a minor subdivision on part of an original tract and transfer or sell another part of the original tract for the purposes of minor subdivision within a threeyear period it is the intent that land abutting a minor subdivision that was owned by the subdivider of the abutting minor subdivision shall not be subdivided as a minor subdivision for a period of three 3 years regardless of ownership 20 standards for configuring new streets

preserve the numbering of the zoning ordinance of this at the editors discretion these provisions have been included as art xi  2912129153 purpose and findings a purpose the purpose of these provisions is to regulate certain types of businesses including but not limited to adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed however it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition otherwise a protected form of expression would vanish as to adult entertainment establishments these provisions represent a balancing of competing interests  reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons b findings based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities including but not limited to city of carrollton city of lagrange city of dalton city of rome whitfield county richmond county dekalb county fulton county and city of augusta which experience we believe are relevant to the problems faced by the city of lafayette georgia the mayor and council take note of the notorious and selfevident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our state moreover it is the findings of the mayor and council that public nudity either partial or total under certain circumstances begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity is disorderly conduct assault batteries prostitution and drug trafficking and use among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity is depression of the surrounding property and the absence of new businesses coming into the area surrounding the establishments and a deterioration in the surrounding neighborhood increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas therefore the limitation of nude conduct in establishments is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which allow andor encourage nudity based on these findings these provisions are adopted to regulate certain types of businesses and to establish where such activity may or may not be conducted these provisions are designed to combat undesirable secondary effects to combat a decline in surrounding property and to combat an increase in crime  7102000 adult entertainment
