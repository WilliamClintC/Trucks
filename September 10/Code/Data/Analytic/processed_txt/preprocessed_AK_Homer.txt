dimensions and similar measurements all distances are measured along a horizontal plane from the appropriate lot line edge of structure or other object these distances are not measured by following the topography of the land bwhen measuring a required distance such as the minimum distance between a structure and a lot line the measurement is made at the shortest distance between the two objects except as otherwise provided in this section or other sections of the zoning code cmeasurements involving a building are made to the closest wall of the building windowsills belt courses cornices eaves chimneys bay windows up to 12 feet in length and similar incidental architectural features that project not more than two feet into any required yard are not included in the measurement and if they extend more than two feet into a required yard that portion beyond two feet is included in the measurement paved terraces are not included in the measurement dcovered porches covered decks and

a light handrail extends higher than 16 inches above the finished grade eopen fire escapes are excluded from the measurement of any required yard only if they project not more than four feet six inches into a required yard fstructures or portions of structures that are entirely underground are not included in measuring required distances   measuring heights awhen measuring height of a

height requirements  the maximum elevation of the remainder of the building shall not exceed the elevation of the first portion nor add more than 12 feet of building height at any point dwhen determining the height of a nonbuilding structure such as a sign fence amateur radio tower communications tower or wireless communications support structure the height shall be calculated as the distance from the base of the structure at normal grade to the top of the highest part of the structure excluding lightning rods for this calculation normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of 1 existing grade prior to construction or 2 the newly established grade after construction exclusive of any fill berm mound or excavation made for the purpose of locating or supporting the structure in cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined structure height shall be calculated on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the structure is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the main building on the lot whichever is lower as2 2 3 2016  a 3 2009    measuring slopes when calculating the slope of a lot an average slope is used based on the elevations at the corners of the lot the average slope of a lot expressed as a percentage is calculated by subtracting the average elevation of the uphill lot line and the average elevation of the downhill lot line and dividing the difference by the average distance between the two lot lines the average
