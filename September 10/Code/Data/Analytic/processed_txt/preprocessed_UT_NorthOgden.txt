the purpose of the planned residential unit development prud is to encourage better utilization of land to develop a sense of community and to ensure compatibility with the surrounding neighborhoods this is accomplished by allowing flexibility in the placement and design of buildings and infrastructure not ordinarily allowed in conventional zoning regulations it allows flexibility in development

system the term wall system refers to tiered walls which will be considered collectively for review purposes 2 a building permit is needed to construct retaining walls that are over 4 feet in height measured from the finished grade below the wall to the finished grade above the wall the building official may require a permit on shorter walls if they support a surcharge such as sloped earth footings vehicles etc 3 when submitting for a building permit a grading plan must be submitted showing retaining walls this plan will be reviewed and approved by the building official if the plan includes retaining wall heights that exceed 4 feet then the plan must also include typical section views cut walls with dimensioned wall heights and distances from walls to structures property lines

behind the wall 5 tiered retaining walls tiered walls must be separated horizontally by a distance that exceeds the largest adjacent wall height tiered walls with a horizontal separation less than this are not permitted even though they may be engineered and stable walls with a horizontal separation of more than twice the largest adjacent wall height are not considered tiered wall system and

and stamped by an engineer licensed in the state the maximum retaining wall height shall be 8 feet 7 walls 8 feet in height or less should be designed and constructed according to standard design and construction practices manufacturer recommendations and published design charts regardless of the height of a retaining wall the building official or city engineer may require stamped engineered plans if it is suspected that the retaining wall needs additional engineering due to design requirements or environmental conditions this may also be true for areas with a high water table or poor soil conditions plans must be stamped by an engineer licensed in the state 8 gravity rock walls and gravity block walls cannot exceed 6 feet in height gravity rock walls or gravity block walls can be tiered to create additional height ie they must be spaced horizontally by the height of the tallest adjacent retaining wall 9 mechanically stabilized earth mse walls such as keystone with geogrid or other tieback systems are permitted reinforced concrete cantilevered retaining walls are also permitted these walls may be tiered but any tier cannot exceed 8 feet in height 10 rock or other coverings on a steepened slope rockery may be considered a retaining wall when the slope exceeds the maximum permanent cut or fill slope recommended by a geotechnical analysis if a slope requires a rockery to be stable then it is to be treated as a retaining wall  print preview  278279 11 if these requirements are more restrictive than the standards found elsewhere in the ordinance then these standards
