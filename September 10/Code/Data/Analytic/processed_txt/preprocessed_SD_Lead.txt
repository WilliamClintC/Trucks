of the city having a special flood hazard be identified by the federal emergency management agency and that floodplain management measures be applied in such flood hazard areas the national flood insurance program was broadened and modified with the passage of the flood disaster protection act of 1973 and other legislative measures it was further modified by the national flood insurance reform

athe flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage passed 3192012  15203 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and
