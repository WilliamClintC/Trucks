information such as submittal requirements appearing later 1 the first subchapter called introduction contains some basic information on the purpose of the zoning sets the stage for the remainder of the document 2 the zoning districts establish the uses permitted in each district they also state which uses are allowed in limited situations known as conditional use and which are prohibited development standards for each zoning district are also included these standards include metrics for residential density height setbacks open space landscaping and civic space the districts indicate which composite building and design standards apply a table showing the permitted and conditional uses in all districts is presented in   3 the use regulations contain requirements for specific uses and development types that apply in all zoning districts examples include accessory uses home occupations and signs these uses may or may not be permitted as of right or as a conditional use depending on how they are listed in the applicable zoning district the standards are designed to address particular issues that are raised by the particular use  such as state or federal legal requirements

district purpose the ag1 district   provides for a wide range of traditional agricultural and agricultural accessory uses at various scales and accommodates all activities typically associated with the primary production and harvesting of crops livestock animal products or plant materials recognizing that those uses may involve noise dust odor use of heavy equipment and chemicals and long hours of operation  conditionally allows for incidental processing packaging storage transportation distribution and other activities intended to add value to agricultural products produced on premises or to ready those products for market given the potential that they may pose for conflicts with agricultural uses due to volumes or speed of vehicular traffic or in light of existing residential density proximity to incompatible uses environmental impacts or degradation of or loss of agriculturally productive lands  allows other incidental activities compatible with agricultural uses as a supplement to family income and supportive of the agricultural community  provides additional economic opportunities for property owners that are generally compatible with agricultural uses such as the establishment of new smallscale farming operations  locates new farm residences in a manner that will minimize impacts on roads soils and existing agricultural land uses  preserves remnant parcels of productive agricultural land following development of adjoining properties  preserves land for production of food and fiber  preserves productive farms by preventing land use conflicts between incompatible users  maintains a viable agricultural land base to support agricultural processing and service industries  reduces costs associated with the provision of governmental services to nonagricultural parcels scattered among agricultural lands  paces and shapes urban growth  meets the criteria for certification of this district as a farmland preservation zoning district under wis

quality of the environment  signs provide an important medium individuals may convey a variety of messages  signs can create safety hazards that threaten the public health safety or welfare such a safety threat is particularly great for signs that are structurally inadequate or that may confuse or distract drivers or pedestrians or that may interfere with official directional or warning signs  signs can also threaten the public welfare by creating aesthetic concerns and detriments to property values such aesthetic concerns and detriments to property values are particularly great when an accumulation of signs results in visual clutter or when one or more signs spoil vistas or views or when one or more signs add or increase commercialism in noncommercial areas  the ability to erect signs serving certain functions such as an address sign or a sign announcing that the property on which it sits is for sale or for lease or a sign used to indicate areas not available or available for public use is an integral part of nearly every property owners ability to realize the fundamental attributes of property ownership the same cannot be said for signs serving other functions such as billboards erected so as to be visible from public rights ofway such signs are primarily designed to take advantage of an audience drawn to that location by the publics substantial investment in rightsofway and other public property  signs serving certain other functions such as small offpremise signs that are in place for fewer than four days are necessary to enable visitors or residents to efficiently reach their intended destinations experience teaches that citizens often plan as if such signs will be present in those settings so in the absence of such signs frustration and disorientation will result and time and fuel will be wasted  no signs that exceed the size or spacing limitations of this section constitute a customary use of signage in the county  the countys landuse regulations have included the regulation of signs in an effort to foster adequate information and means of expression and to promote the economic viability of the community while protecting

giving due consideration to civil rights of persons partaking in such entertainment it continues to be the intent of the adult establishment regulations and this section to regulate the advertisement of such establishments of adult entertainment the purpose of this section is to  regulate signs in a manner that does not create an impermissible conflict with statutory administrative or

horizontally unless otherwise indicated 3 road classification system this section classifies roads for purposes of applying the standards in this section a determination of road classification 1 roads are classified based on many factors including speed and volume of traffic road classifications fall into a 4category hierarchy the classifications in descending order are arterial collector subcollector and access roads see subsection b and figure  below 2 the functionaljurisdictional classification of existing roads are located on the st croix county official functional classification road map available from the community development department highway department or wisdot 3 the wisconsin department of transportation wisdot and the st croix county highway department determine arterial and major and minor collector road status on their respective systems their current functional classification applies to this section 4 the st croix county community development department in conjunction with the appropriate municipal jurisdiction determines subcollector and access roads 5 residential roads may fall into any of these classifications except arterials b description of functional classifications the functional descriptions of each of these classifications follow 1 arterials arterials provide for rapid speed and movement of high volumes of traffic between areas an arterial road should have no private accesses its function is to conduct traffic between communities and activity centers and to connect communities to major state and interstate highways there are two types of arterials principal arterials and minor arterials see below a principal arterials principal arterials are those highway corridors that have trip length and travel density characteristics of an interstate or interregional nature principal arterials in general serve all urban areas greater than 5000 population and may include interstate highways freeways expressways fourlane divided highways and twolane highways b minor arterials minor arterials are those highways which in combination with principal arterials serve cities communities and other major traffic generators providing intraregional and interarea travels minor arterials may include fourlane divided highways twolane highways and county trunk highways 2 collectors collectors provide for moderate speed and movement of medium volumes of traffic and distribute traffic from arterial roads there are two types of collector roads major collectors and minor collectors see below as the principal road within residential or commercial areas collectors carry relatively high traffic volumes and convey traffic from arterial roads to lowerorder roads because a collectors function is to promote the free flow of traffic the roads should not have parking or private residential access a collectors secondary function is to serve abutting land uses a major collectors major collectors provide service to moderate sized communities and other intraarea traffic generators and link those generators to larger population centers and higher function highways b minor collectors minor collectors provide service to remaining smaller communities and tie local traffic generators with the rural surrounding area minor collectors are spaced consistent with population density to collect traffic and bring all developed areas within a reasonable distance of a higherorder road 3 subcollectors subcollectors connect with access roads and convey traffic to major and minor collectors like an access road a subcollector provides frontage and access to residential lots but also carries some to access roads subcollectors include all roads not identified as major or minor arterials major or minor collectors or access roads generally subcollectors are all town roads in the original town road grid system and town roads identified as or subcollectors on a town comprehensive plan or official map some roads in a subdivision may be subcollectors instead of access roads if the two ends of the road extend beyond the boundary of the subdivision and one end of the road eventually connects to another subcollector or higher order road 4 access roads access roads are designed to conduct traffic between individual parcels or lots and higher order roads access roads provide for low speed and low volumes of traffic and convey traffic to subcollector collector and arterial roads as the lowestorder road in the hierarchy the access road usually carries little includes short roads culdesacs and courts access roads include local roads within conventional subdivisions local roads within conservation design development subdivisions culdesacs loop roads lakeshore roads that existed prior to 197 and roads not otherwise classified and located in unincorporated hamlets including boardman burkhardt cylon emerald erin corners forest hersey houlton huntington jewett johannesburg and new centerville a culdesac roads roads that are closed at one end with turnarounds not platted for extension b loop roads loop roads are short oneway that turn back to the originating road c temporary deadend roads roads that terminate in a t turnaround and are platted for future extension d private roads roads located on private property and providing access to 3 or more properties figure  functional classification system

committees which are assigned decisionmaking responsibilities will occasionally confront proposed land use changes which have unusually significant consequences or which arouse unusually high levels of citizen interest in those cases the decision maker may find that the procedures specified in the sections of this chapter which govern the case do not allow a full and complete examination and articulation of the environmental and other impacts of the proposed change in use this situation is expected since those procedures are generally tailored to the more average or routine cases and are designed to balance the need of the board or committee for information against the burdens which a more complete procedure imposes upon landowners therefore this section provides a special procedure

particular facts upon which it bases its conclusion that the land is not suitable for residential use and afford the subdivider an opportunity to present evidence regarding such unsuitability if heshe so desires thereafter the town board may affirm modify or withdraw its determination of unsuitability  b additional considerations 1 areas of archaeological andor historical interest shall be designated by the state historical society 2 areas of geological interest shall be designated by the state geological and natural history survey 3 suitability of land for private sewerage systems shall be determined in accordance with wisconsin administrative condominium developments a purpose 1 the town board hereby finds that certain issues arise in condominium developments that require limited applicability of this condominium developments the state legislature has recognized that subdivision ordinances may apply to condominiums but that subdivision ordinances shall not impose burdens upon condominiums that are different from those imposed on other property of a similar character not subject to a declaration of condominium 2 the factor that makes this to a condominium development is the creation of multiple distinct property entities at or near the ground surface subject land division and subdivision to property taxation as separate parcels with each property entity having different ownership and management the town determines that this factor makes a condominium development dissimilar both physically and in ownership from developments in which the land and improvements are under unitary ownership management and control 3 thus the town board hereby finds that new condominium developments can place impacts on community resources in the same manner as other new developments which are characterized by division of land into lots these impacts include a additional population density  b possibility of use of particular land in a manner unsuitable to the lands characteristics  c additional demands upon town area parks recreation areas utility facilities and schools  d additional traffic and street use b portions of to condominium developments the
