state of minnesota the council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this adult theaters and adult cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments the code of webster groves  2018 licensing and regulation of particular businesses  3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids acquired immunodeficiency syndrome caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states 600 in 1982  2200 in 1983  4600 in 1984  8555 in 198 and 253448  8 there continue to be increasing numbers of reported cases of aids in the state of missouri 9 since 1981 and to the present there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the hiv antibody test in missouri 10 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 198 and 45200  11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 12 in his report of  the surgeon general of the united states has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the the code of webster groves  2018 licensing and regulation of particular businesses  owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 16 the findings noted in subsections 1 15 raise substantial governmental concerns 17 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22 in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct 23 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this code of webster groves  2018 licensing and regulation of particular businesses  24 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of

to achieve better use of land than may be possible strict application of standard zoning and subdivision controls while also insulating or buffering educational facility uses from adjoining uses and most particularly from singlefamily residential uses this third set of regulations is referred to herein as a major educational campus mec district which allows certain variations from the ec1 and ec2 base district regulations in order to take advantage of the provisions of an mec district a n educational facility may apply for approval of a cmp and once a cmp is submitted and legislatively approved the development of the campus subject to the cmp will proceed in accordance with the cmp rather than the ec base district regulations any campus that is rezoned mec district process may thereafter only be amended in accordance with the provisions of as applicable and any amendments shall include only those uses allowed as a matter of right by a conditional use permit or as an accessory use as stated in the ec 1 or ec2 district from which it originated general statement of purposei the city of webster groves is one of the oldest communities in the state of missouri and has grown in essential accord with its comprehensive plan in order to preserve and protect the existing virtually fully developed and predominantly residential character of the properties in the city  to maintain the comprehensive plan of the city  to regulate development  and to preserve and protect the public health safety and wellbeing of the community as a whole it is necessary to regulate building scale open space and the intensity of the builtout environment the city of webster groves is experiencing unprecedented change in the development and growth of some of its key institutions within the past three decades there has been significant growth of the builtout environment and an expansion of the boundaries of a number of these institutions as a result there is a real concern that a continuing increase in the scale and density of development  and the attendant traffic and parking congestion and population density in and near the citys least developed singlefamily residential and historic districts  may dramatically alter or change the citys long established and essential character unless such growth is properly managed and located due to this expansion there is also a concern about the loss of existing affordable housing stock tax base and the impacts of infill development on the character and infrastructure in longestablished neighborhoods it has been determined that the construction of large scale institutional development may be appropriate in less developed commercial or blighted areas of the region these institutions are now being planned or constructed in areas more suited to less intensive institutional uses such as elementary secondary or specialized institution uses it is the intent of the city to maintain development of institutions in or near residential and historic districts at a scale suitable to the surrounding environment in addition the purpose of district regulations for educational institutions having five or more acres of contiguous property is to encourage and allow more planned creative and imaginative design of land development these developments should simultaneously be the code of webster groves  2018 zoning  preserving the character of surrounding neighborhoods particularly those with features of historical significance and preserving public and private open and recreation spaces these regulations will facilitate the efficient use of land that may not be possible though the application of traditional zoning district regulations it is in the public interest of the city of webster groves to maintain an appropriate balance between building scale intensity of development traffic flow parking demand and population levels in keeping with the environmental setting and character of the neighborhood  an ec district whether controlled by the base district regulations or a cmp is established by a zoning change initiated either by the city the owner of a campus or by new construction as defined in this  the base district regulations shall govern unless and until a cmp is approved in order for a cmp to be approved it must first be submitted in compliance with this with the internal policies and procedures of the department of planning and development which are hereby authorized to be established by the director of planning and development director from time to time after the director reviews and determines that the submittal for a proposed cmp is complete the director shall forward the submittal to the city plan commission for review and recommendation and then to the city council for approval denial or modification 3 a zoning map amendment shall accompany any change of zoning to an ec district 4 condition precedent a condition precedent to approval of a rezoning to an ec district designation is that the primary use within the proposed area is an educational facility as defined in this educational facility will follow the base district regulations unless a cmp is approved mec

except with regard to permitted residential single family uses properties zoned as ec district shall not be required to subdivide a campus into lots and shall not be required to adjust or eliminate internal property lines to permit construction of structures for uses authorized within the ec district base regulations or an approved cmp no singlefamily residential use permitted in an ec district shall be constructed until the owner or qualified applicant has first complied with all subdivision historic preservation and other land use regulations then in place ec1 ec2 and mec districts specific purposes & use regulations there shall be two discrete and separate districts for educational facilities to be known as the ec1 district and the ec2 district each has base district regulations that can only be modified campus master planning process after a cmp has been approved in accordance with this the resulting district shall be known as an mec district and shall not be governed by the base district regulations but by the approved cmp purpose of the ec1 district the land use patterns of the city have a long welldocumented and storied history that makes it different from any other suburb perhaps in the world certainly in the st louis county complex of more than 100 communitiesii for many decades webster groves located along the missouri pacific rail line with 32 accommodation trains daily not only for the professionals and business persons but for the convenience of families alsoiii allowed residents of the urbanized center of st louis to escape the then prevalent unhealthy conditions of city life to enjoy the cool green spaces graced by large lawns and mature trees with frame houses that had high ceilings and expansive front porches all of which contributed to webster groves becoming known as the queen of the suburbsiv within the prevalence of relatively large residential lots the mature tree canopy and the significant stock of older homes and historic districts some of webster groves wellknown educational institutions took root and were established in a similar style with gracious front lawns wellspaced buildings that were appropriately set back from and respectful of the neighboring residential properties prominent among these were eden seminary edgewood childrens center great circle and the epworth children and family services all of which have remained relatively small lowdensity uses that are highly compatible with the residential uses that the code of webster groves  2018 zoning  are predominant adjacent to their boundaries significantly these institutions have maintained their large open spaces lowintensity and low density uses into the 21st century the ec1 uses include institutional uses similar to those lower intensity uses that have been located in the city for the last few decades ec1 uses may also include conditional use permit process smallscale retail student union theater and auditorium uses that attract substantially less pedestrian or vehicular traffic than similar larger scale uses that may be allowed as a matter of right and customarily found and ancillary to ec2 type uses the ec1 district is established to preserve and protect longestablished land use patterns and the character of the surrounding neighborhoods while providing for primary or secondary private or parochial educational facilities that have no student housing and for low intensity educational facilities having limited student housing that could include housing for families of students  to allow for such other related uses which are of an educational nature and are compatible with the character and intensity of the surrounding properties  and to provide district regulations and development requirements consistent with these goals purpose of the ec2 district some of the citys other neighborhoods that contain prominent nonprofit educational institutions developed more densely over the course of time and their immediately surrounding neighborhoods were transformed from residential into higher density uses characterized predominantly by institutional and commercial uses and transportation corridors for railroad and interstate highway uses successive aerial photographs from the 1930s to the present demonstrate steady growth and intensity of use and population south of lockwood boulevard where the citys high school nerinx hall and webster university have come to dominate a landscape that was once predominantly residential and wooded the ec2 district is established to allow a greater scope of uses density of uses and population for an educational facility than is appropriate to an ec1 district an ec2 district can include larger scale dormitory type student housing larger scale student unions lighted athletic fields and auditorium uses that attract substantially more pedestrian or vehicular traffic than similar smaller scale uses customarily found and ancillary to ec1 type uses additionally in an ec2 district theater and auditorium type uses leased out to third parties for events available to the public at large have historically been allowed as accessory uses in more densely developed areas appropriate to an ec2 designation purpose of the mec district the purpose of the mec district is provide an a campus master plan process the city plan

opportunity to have full knowledge of the property before the work commences  ongoing stormwater management the responsible party shall be responsible for controlling all stormwater generated on the property  regulations unless otherwise approved by the building commissioner in writing the following principles shall be applied when controlling stormwater a if any existing impervious surface is removed during construction or development that area shall be considered as pervious for the purpose of calculating the differential resulting from the new construction example 1 replacing a 100 square foot concrete patio with a 200 square foot home addition the stormwater differential to be addressed would be based on the full 200 square feet of new impervious roof surface example 2 when constructing a new residence on a lot where a house was demolished the lot will be treated as if it had been entirely undeveloped thereby requiring 100% or the stormwater to be addressed in the plan example 3 adding a second story to an existing building would require a stormwater plan to address the stormwater form the entire roof over the addition exception  if the new construction results in the impervious surface being replaced with a pervious or semipervious surface the development shall be credited with a net reduction in stormwater runoff for that area of the development b the calculation of differential stormwater resulting from the new construction shall assume that the area covered by new impervious materials is replacing pervious areas regardless of the preconstruction status of the site semipervious and pervious surfaces replacing impervious surfaces shall be credited as a reduction in stormwater example a 100 square foot concrete patio 100% impervious surface that is removed to install a 200 square foot building addition the differential is based on 200 square feet of 100% impervious surface replacing 200 square feet of pervious surface c all stormwater shall be conveyed to an approved location by an approved means including but not limited to adequately sized pipes channels cisterns and retentiondetention areas where possible sheet drainage should be used in lieu of point drainage d no stormwater shall be discharged to an adjoining public or private property in a manner that negatively impacts the adjoining property existing conditions shall be the basis for determining negative impact the code of webster groves  2018 stormwater e stormwater shall be directed away from buildings and structures on the lot of issue as well as adjoining lots f no point discharge outlet shall be located and directed in the vicinity of any property line if the stormwater discharge from a design storm event can reasonably be expected to flow above ground onto an adjacent property or rightsofway unless the owner of the impacted property or the director of public works in the case of public rightsofway has specifically granted a stormwater easement to the owner of the property which is the source of the stormwater point discharge outlets include but are not limited to downspout outlets sump pump outlets and yard pop ups exception  an exception can be granted by the building commissioner or the director of public works in the case of public rightsofway when an applicant can demonstrate a hardship when the building commissioner determines that no other option exists and the intent of these provisions is met the outlet may be allowed within 10 feet of the property line the request shall be in writing and addressed to the building commissioner or the director of public works who shall respond to the request within 30 days of the receipt of the request no response by the building commissioner or the director of public works in case of public rightsofway within 30 days shall be the same as granting the request the director of public works may permit a curb cut to permit stormwater to discharge directly to the curbgutter portion of the street the curb cut shall be permitted only in cases of necessity not merely for the convenience of the applicant g no stormwater shall discharge into a sanitary system exception  1 when approved by the st louis metropolitan sewer district msd or 2 when discharging to an approved combination sewer h designing for maximum infiltration and onsite detention of stormwater utilizing rain gardens cisterns rain barrels and similar receiving areas and devices isencouraged i all pavement and constructed surfaces shall be considered as 100% impervious for purposes of calculating differential stormwater exception  1 surfaces may be considered as semipervious if it can be demonstrated that the surface is designed to allow for a certain percentage of imperviousness and retention 2 plans sealed by a registered professional may provide a design that allows for varying percentages of imperviousness 3 surfaces including but not limited to lawn and garden areas may be considered as 5% impervious j calculations for stormwater control shall be based on a design stormevent the code of webster groves  2018 stormwater k when controlling differential stormwater the designer shall not

minimize public and private losses due to erosion siltation and water pollution  and to maintain stream water quality by provisions designed to 1 create buffer zones along the streams of webster groves for the protection of water resources  and 2 minimize land development within such buffers by establishing buffer zone requirements and by requiring authorization for any such activities b intent stream buffers are necessary to protect the integrity of stream ecosystems and habitats stream buffers also protect development by maintaining the integrity of the natural storm water drainage systems natural streams meander and change their channel over time and structures built too close to a stream are at risk or may require expensive remedial protection stream buffers provide numerous benefits including 1 protecting restoring and maintaining the chemical physical and biological integrity of streams and their water resources  2 removing pollutants delivered in urban stormwater  3 reducing erosion and controlling sedimentation  4 protecting and stabilizing stream banks  5 providing for infiltration of stormwater runoff  6 maintaining base flow of streams  7 contributing organic matter that is a source of food and energy for the aquatic ecosystem  8 providing tree canopy to shade streams and promote desirable aquatic habitat  9 providing riparian wildlife habitat  the code of
