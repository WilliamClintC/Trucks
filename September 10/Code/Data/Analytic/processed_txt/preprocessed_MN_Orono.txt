consumption of alcohol by persons under the age of 21 is harmful to those persons and constitutes a potential threat to public health from injuries related to alcohol consumption such as alcohol overdose or alcoholrelated traffic collisions b alcohol is also an addictive drug which if used irresponsibly could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user c as a result gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 should be prevented as much as possible d gatherings involving underage possession and consumption often occur outside the presence of parents or other responsible adults however there are times when a parent or other adult is present and condones the activity and in some circumstances provides the alcohol e although furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a crime it is difficult to prove and an ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage consumption f a deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally responsible for hosting a gathering where underage possession or consumption occurs 2 the purpose of this section is to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol even if done within the confines of a private residence and to hold persons criminally responsible who host gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the gathering supplied the alcohol or was present 3 the city council intends that this section should not target parents who may have alcoholic beverages on their premises but who have issued a standing order that alcohol is not to be consumed by underage persons on those premises

underage person will attend or is likely to attend  and c the person fails to take reasonable steps to prevent the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages by an underage person  and d an underage person consumes an alcoholic beverage or possesses an alcoholic beverage with the intent to consume it at the gathering 2 examples of reasonable steps include a directing on a onetime basis or as a standing order that no consumption of alcohol and alcoholic beverages is allowed  or b controlling access to alcohol and alcoholic beverages  or c checking identification of attendees to determine age  or d supervising the activities of underage persons at the gathering either in person or responsible adult 3 a person is not criminally responsible under this section if the person does not know that a gathering will occur or does not know that alcoholic beverages will be present or does not know that an underage person will be or is likely to be present however if a person has the knowledge specified in paragraph 1 above a person who hosts a gathering does not have to be present at the gathering to be criminally responsible 4 a person is criminally responsible for violating paragraph 1 above if the person intentionally aids advises hires counsels or conspires with or otherwise procures another to commit the prohibited act c exceptions 1 this section does not apply to conduct of an underage person that is permitted by his or her parent and occurs in the parents household 2 this section does not apply to a legally protected religious observance 3 this section does not apply when an underage person is lawfully in possession of alcohol or alcoholic beverages during the course and scope of employment 4 this section does not apply to the holder of a liquor license

danger to the health safety and general welfare of the community 1 numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing secondhand smoke or environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of diseases such as lung cancer cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease and a cause of strokes and heart attacks 2 the public health services national toxicology program has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen according to the united states surgeon general there are more than 50 cancercausing chemicals in secondhand smoke 3 secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to the elderly and those with cardiovascular disease and impaired respiratory function children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk and severity of asthma respiratory infections sudden infant death syndrome developmental abnormalities cancer and premature death 4 the united states surgeon general reports that there is no riskfree level of exposure to secondhand smoke and that even short exposure to secondhand smoke can damage blood vessels decrease coronary flow velocity reserves and reduce heart rate variability potentially increasing the risk of a heart attack even in healthy persons brief exposure can lead to changes in the upper airway 5 eliminating smoking indoors and in enclosed spaces fully protects nonsmokers from exposure to secondhand smoke simply separating smokers from nonsmokers cleaning the air and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate exposures of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke although air cleaners can remove large particles from smoke smaller particles and gases found in secondhand smoke cannot be removed from the air 6 scientific studies conducted by stanford university and others found that outdoor smoke can reach the same level as indoor smoke persons near an outdoor smoker can breathe in wisps of smoke that can be tens or 100s times more concentrated that normal background air pollution levels 7 the americans with disabilities act includes respiratory function as a disability the ada requires disabled persons have access to public places and workplaces 8 the national institute for occupational safety and health has concluded that smoke is an occupational carcinogen 9 nonsmokers who are exposed to secondhand smoke at work have a 25 percent to 30 percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function than persons not exposed to secondhand smoke at work 10 secondhand smoke exposure leads to higher worker absenteeism from respiratory disease lower productivity higher cleaning and maintenance costs increased health insurance rates and increased liability claims for diseases related to secondhand smoke exposure 11 smoking is a potential cause of fires in parks and outdoor spaces fire can spread to nearby homes and businesses 12 use of tobacco products

growing in population from a rural agricultural community to a rural residential community use of land for residential purposes is considered primary with other uses viewed as supporting this use while present commercial or industrial activity where consistent with residential use and other guiding principles will be protected by ordinance or conditional use permit it is not the intention to expand or allow all such commercial or industrial activity to a degree where it conflicts with the primary residential use and the other guiding principles the continued use of land for farming and similar purposes will be protected by ordinance or conditional use permit where sufficient acreage allows such use to continue without conflict with expanding residential use 2 the maintenance of open space and the avoidance of overcrowding of land is a basic guiding principle in this plan in addition to avoiding the ill effects of excessive intensive land development it is the policy to also avoid the threat to public health which occurs with excessive crowding of private sewage disposal systems on substandard building sites 3 the city has recognized that many of the open space policies which have previously provided the basic direction of the land use policies have proven to be inadequate it is now clear that onsite disposal systems must not be allowed on any site of less than two acres it is now clear that the physical characteristics of the city make the extension of public services such as sewer extremely expensive and almost impossible in some areas the city and other governmental agencies have learned that the premature development of open areas can be costly and disastrous to the environment 4 of paramount importance to the citizens of the city and to the citizens of the metropolitan area is the preservation of lake minnetonka and the wetlands that provide the only practical system of filtration and purification of the stormwater so vital to the preservation of lake minnetonka and the groundwater supplies in the area the disastrous effects of intense residential and commercial development within the city and especially in those areas adjacent to lake minnetonka and the wetlands are painfully evident the adoption of additional regulations rezoning of certain areas and the creation of larger lot sizes in unsewered areas is mandatory in order to protect the safety health and welfare of the citizens of the city 5 the guiding principles of maintaining open spaces avoiding the ill effects of overcrowding avoiding premature development avoiding the future pollution problems which are inherent in any plan to intensely develop land adjacent to wetlands and lake minnetonka and the need to change some allowed uses in order to preserve the quality of the groundwater supplies in the area were recognized in the comprehensive municipal plan adopted on  and the amendments to the comprehensive zoning chapter and map adopted by the council on  the principles established in the 1974 comprehensive municipal plan were further reinforced by the 1980 orono community management plan adopted by resolution no 1338 on  and the 20002020 orono community management plan adopted by resolution no 4723 on  the official zoning map has since been revised by nd series adopted   nd series adopted   nd series adopted   nd series adopted   nd

recreational district is intended to provide a district which will allow a lowdensity seasonal form of residential development or recreational activity on the three lake minnetonka islands within the city big island mahpiyata island and deering island are totally surrounded by water special problems exist because of their isolated location and because there is no direct access by land or bridge transportation is difficult dangerous and slow especially in fall or spring when the ice is forming or melting engineering financial administrative and practical difficulties prevent servicing the islands with sewer or water utilities garbage collection or complete police fire medical emergency or other municipal services the islands have historically been used for summer cabins camping spots temporary boat landings and a disabled veterans summer camp as long as this usage remains minimal public health and safety is reasonably maintained but development forecasts indicate increasing pressures for more intensive usage that could easily exceed the citys public service capabilities for these reasons the citys comprehensive plans have longestablished policies encouraging eventual public ownership of the islands as recreational resources for general lake users in addition limited private seasonal recreational use would be allowed to continue indefinitely subject to strict conformance with special health and safety standards the rs district is established to implement these special planning policies 311 future amendments the rs district regulations represent an innovative attempt to solve the unique problems relating to historic use and previously platted substandard lots on the islands while at the same time assuring the property owners of continued reasonable use of their property it may be found by subsequent city councils that this division was not restrictive enough to protect the health safety and welfare of the citizens and that new development potential granted to property owners by this division may have to be modified therefore no new development rights granted by this division shall be deemed to be vested property rights but shall remain subject to future modification by the city 3119 nonconformities a nonconforming uses 1 no new use of land or structures shall be permitted in the rs district except in compliance with

maples ginkgo ash or other longlived shade trees acceptable to the city shall be planted 60 parks and playgrounds class ii and iii subdivisions the following provisions apply to class ii and iii subdivisions 1 lands for public use the city finds that when land is subdivided including a planned residential development or a planned unit development the resulting additional housing units or commercialindustrial buildings have an impact on the citys park system therefore pursuant to minn stat   subd 2b the city requires all persons corporations or other legal entities that subdivide land within the city as a prerequisite to approval of a lot division final plat planned residential development or planned unit development to convey to the city or dedicate to the public for use as parks playgrounds trails or open space a given percentage of the land being platted or developed as specified in this section such portions to be approved by the city in lieu thereof the subdivider shall at the option of the city pay to the city for use in the acquisition development or improvement of public parks playgrounds trails wetlands or open spaces and debt retirement in connection with the foregoing an equivalent amount in cash based upon the fair market value of the land to be developed the form of contribution cash land or any combination shall be decided by the city council based upon the need and conformance with the comprehensive plan the amount of the dedication requirement shall be roughly proportional to the impact of the subdivision on the citys park system 2 dedicated land requirements any land to be dedicated as a requirement of this section shall be reasonably adaptable for the public purposes listed in subsection 1 of this section factors used in evaluating the adequacy of proposed dedicated areas shall include size shape topography drainage geology tree cover access and location 3 land dedication minimum area subdividers shall be required to dedicate to the city for parks playgrounds trails open spaces and other public purposes as a minimum that percentage of gross land area or other such amount as may be determined by the city council as set forth below a in residentialagriculturalmultiple residential zoned land dedication requirement of eight percent of the land being platted or subdivided the dedication required shall be roughly proportional to the projected impact of the proposed development on the citys park system because of the vastly differing land values in the city the eight percent park dedication requirement could result in park dedication requirements that are either significantly greater than or significantly less than the amount which is roughly proportional to the impact of the proposed development on the citys park system periodically therefore the city will establish both a maximum and minimum park dedication amount per dwelling unit based on an updated projection of the cost of the citys park system and the proportionate share of this projected cost to be borne by new dwelling units in the city this will be done by a resolution of the city council b in commercialindustrial zoned land dedication requirement of eight percent of the land being platted or subdivided the dedication required shall be roughly proportional to the projected impact of the proposed development on the citys park system the city finds that the employees of commercialindustrial developments in the city make use of the citys park system particularly trails and natural areas because the citys park system is focused on trails and natural areas versus active community parks and ballfields commercialindustrial employees use the citys park system in ways similar to city residents therefore the commercialindustrial dedication requirement will be tied to the residential dedication requirement by determining the number of employees that is equivalent to a residential dwelling unit in terms of impact on the citys park system periodically the city will establish both a maximum and minimum park dedication amount per employee based on this determination and the determination of the residential dedication requirement as set out in subsection 3a of this section this will be done by resolution of the city council c because the citys park system is focused on trails and natural open space areas the city does not have a broad system of neighborhood parks if a subdivision is planned to be served by a neighborhood park this subdivision will receive a greater benefit from the citys park system than that received by the general population therefore the maximum park dedication amount as determined in subsection 3a of this section may be exceeded up to the full eight percent dedication requirement in the case of a subdivision that is planned to be served by a neighborhood park 4 cash contribution in lieu of lands in those instances where a cash contribution is to be made by the subdivider in lieu of a conveyance or dedication of land the cash contribution to be contributed shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the equivalent undeveloped land that would otherwise have been conveyed or dedicated the city shall account for such funds in a special fund named park dedication funds these funds are to be used only for the acquisition development and improvement of public parks playgrounds trails wetlands or open spaces and debt retirement in connection with the foregoing 5 fair market value of lands fair market value for purposes of this section shall be the land predevelopment value to be determined by the city council as of the time of preliminary plat application in accordance with the following a the city assessor shall recommend to the city council as to the fair market value of the land after consultation with the subdivider b if agreement is not reached between the city assessor and subdivider the fair market value shall be determined in accordance with the following 1 fair market value as determined by the city council based upon a current appraisal submitted to the city by the subdivider at his expense the appraisal shall be made by appraisers who are approved members of srea or mai or equivalent real estate societies 2 if the city disputes such appraisal amounts it may obtain an appraisal of the property by a qualified real estate appraiser which the city council selects and which appraisal may be accepted by the city as being an accurate appraisal at fair market value the cost of the appraisal shall be paid by the subdivider c the determination of fair market value of the undeveloped land by the city assessor city council or designated appraisers shall be determined at the time of preliminary subdivision approval provided that there is final plat approval within the time limits as set forth in this chapter the time of preliminary plat approval is utilized because the nature of the subdivision its probable population lot size and value and other relevant factors are known if an extension of the time limits in this chapter is approved by the city council the fair market value shall be determined as of the time of the approval of that extension in determining the fair market value as of time of preliminary plat application or its extension the factors to be included in the analysis shall include any and all factors which are generally accepted and used by approved members of srea or mai or equivalent real estate appraisal societies 6 future subdivision any land which is further subdivided divided or replatted or applied for such subdivision division or replatting subsequent to  shall be subject to the requirements of the ordinance then in effect concerning dedication of land for public purposes  and credit shall be given for any charges previously imposed upon that land if the subdivider can prove that fees were previously paid in no event shall the city be liable for any payment which may be due because of a subsequent reduction in the application percentage of land or equivalent market value in cash to be dedicated 62  nd series  1 4131998 secs 8222882250  reserved division 2  lots
