section is to establish standards for driveway spacing and the number of driveways for application during the site plan review process the standards of this section are intended to promote safe and efficient travel within the city  minimize disruptive and potentially hazardous traffic conflicts  separate traffic conflict areas by reducing the number of driveways  provide efficient spacing standards between driveways and between driveways and intersections  implement the master plan and protect the substantial public investment in the street system  and to ensure reasonable access to properties though not always be the most direct access the standards herein apply to site plans and plats along roads which are under the jurisdiction of the shiawassee county road commission or michigan department of transportation mdot both of those agencies have driveway design and permit requirements however those general standards may not be sufficient to meet the particular traffic issues and objectives of the city of durand therefore the driveway standards herein may be more restrictive than those provided by the road agencies construction within the public rightofway under the jurisdiction of shiawassee county or mdot still must also meet the permit requirements of the road agency where any conflicts arise the more stringent standard shall apply 2 general standards for driveway location a driveways shall be located so as to minimize interference with the free movement of traffic to provide adequate sight distance and to provide the most favorable driveway grade b driveways including the radii but not including right turn lanes passing lanes and tapers shall be located entirely within the rightofway frontage unless otherwise approved by shiawassee county and upon written certification from the adjacent property owner agreeing to such encroachment 3 standards for the number of commercial driveways the number of commercial driveways shall be the minimum necessary to provide reasonable access for regular traffic and emergency vehicles while preserving traffic operations and safety along the public roadway additional driveways may be permitted for a property only under one of the following a one 1 additional driveway may be allowed for properties with a continuous frontage of over three hundred 300 feet and one 1 additional driveway for each additional three hundred 300 feet of frontage if the planning commission determines there are no other reasonable access opportunities b two oneway driveways may be permitted along a frontage of at least one hundred twenty five 125 feet provided the driveways do not interfere with operations at other driveways or along the street c the planning commission may determine additional driveways are justified due to the amount of traffic generated by the use without compromising traffic operations along the public street based upon a traffic impact study city of durand zoning cusersjlundgrendesktopnew folder 2durand zoning _2005doc 4 driveway spacing standards a between driveways the minimum spacing between two commercial driveways shall be determined based upon posted speed limits along the parcel frontage the minimum spacings indicated below are measured from centerline to centerline posted speed minimum driveway limit mph spacing in feet 25 125 30 155 35 185 40 225 45+ 300 1 for sites with insufficient street frontage to meet the above criterion the planning commission may require construction of the driveway along a side street a shared driveway with an adjacent property construction of a driveway along the property line farthest from the intersection or require a servicefrontage road b offsets to reduce leftturn conflicts new commercial driveways should be aligned with driveways or streets on the opposite side the roadway where possible if alignment is not possible driveways should be offset a minimum of two hundred fifty 250 feet along an arterial roadway and one hundred fifty 1 50 feet along other roadways longer offsets may be required depending on the expected inbound leftturn volumes of the driveways c spacing from intersections minimum spacing requirements between a proposed commercial driveway and an intersection either adjacent or on the opposite side of the street may be set on a casebycase basis by the planning commission during site plan review but in no instance shall be less than the distances listed below the following measurements are from the near edge of the proposed driveway measured at the throat perpendicular to the street to the near lane edge of the intersecting street or pavement edge for uncurbed sections city of durand zoning cusersjlundgrendesktopnew folder 2durand zoning _2005doc 5 standards for shared driveways and servicefrontage roads the use of service roads in conjunction with driveway spacing is intended to preserve traffic flow along major thoroughfares and minimize traffic conflicts while retaining reasonable access to the property where noted above or where the planning commission determines that reducing the number of access points may have a beneficial impact on traffic operations and safety while preserving the property owners right to reasonable access access from a side street a shared driveway or service road connecting two or more properties or uses may be required in particular service drives frontage roads or at least a connection between uses may be required in the following cases a where the driveway spacing standards of this section can not be met b when the driveway could potentially interfere with traffic operations at an existing or potential traffic signal location c the site is along regional arterials or arterials particularly along segments experiencing congestion or a relatively high number of accidents d the property frontage has limited sight distance e the fire department recommends a second means of emergency access 6 design standards for service drives service roads as an alternate to numerous individual driveways serving a series of uses or lots shall be designed according to the following additional standards a

the service road in reviewing the site plan the planning commission may permit temporary parking in the easement area where a continuous service road is not yet available provided that the layout allows removal of the parking in the future to allow extension of the service road city of durand zoning access the planning commission shall approve the location of all accesses to the servicefrontage road based on the driveway spacing standards of this temporary access the planning commission may approve temporary access points where a continuous service road is not yet available and a performance bond or escrow is created to assure elimination of temporary access when the service road is continued g elevation the site plan shall indicate the proposed elevation of the servicefrontage road at the property line and the building department shall maintain a record of all service road elevations so that their grades can be coordinated h landscaping the greenbelt between a service road and the public street rightofway shall be landscaped as specified in of the landscaping standards i maintenance each property owner shall be responsible for maintaining the servicefrontage road 7 modification of standards for special situations during site plan review the planning commission shall have the authority to modify the standards of this consideration of the following a the standards of this section would prevent reasonable access to the site b access via a shared driveway or servicefrontage road is not possible due to the presence of existing buildings or topographic conditions c roadway improvements such as the addition of a traffic signal a center turn lane or bypass lane will be made to improve overall traffic operations prior to project completion or occupancy of the building d the use involves the redesign of an existing development or a new use which will generate less traffic than the previous use e the proposed location and design is supported by the shiawassee county road commission as an acceptable design under the conditions the planning commission may also request the applicant provide a traffic impact study f the modification shall be of the minimum amount necessary but in no case shall spacing of a fullaccess driveway be less than sixty 60 feet measured centerline to centerline city of durand zoning
