the general category within which the specific law would fall thus a zoning regulation or subdivision regulation would be found in entitled land use whereas a taxicab regulation would be found in entitled business regulations within each several chapters which further divide the functional categorization a chapter may or may not be further divided into parts the basic unit of the however is

subsections by adding a lower case letter to the section number a brief subject title is used with each section number and the lettered subsections to aid the user in locating the proper reference the user is seeking for example subsection a entitled issuance under entitled ownership cardbicycle plate describes the basic manner by which bicycle ownership cards and license plates will be issued

section and even subsections where considered desirable is identified at its close by a parentheses showing a notation such as  this means that that particular section was adopted by as or contained in section  in this way the source and authority of a particular law and its effective date can be verified with reasonable ease original code pages are not identified as being revised but all

manner the unrestricted display and sale by businesses of narcotics paraphernalia enumerated in the california health and safety may impress upon young people the conception that the use of such paraphernalia with illegal drugs is endorsed by businesses and condoned by the community the impression of endorsement or acceptance of controlled substance use is likely to encourage drug use by

picketing of residential properties 6510  purpose in enacting this chapter the city council finds as follows a protecting the wellbeing tranquility and privacy of the homes of residents of the city is a significant governmental interest b a special benefit of the privacy all residents enjoy within their residential properties is the ability to avoid unwanted intrusions and unwanted speech c the targeting picketing of a residential property creates a captive audience situation because the occupants cannot readily move to another residence in order to avoid the unwelcome picketing activity being directed at them d picketing which targets specific residential properties of residents of the city is thus an inherently and offensive intrusion on residential privacy e the protection of the right to privacy in the home requires the enactment of a reasonable time place and manner restriction upon picketing activity f this chapter is a necessary time place and manner restriction intended to reconcile and protect the first amendment rights of picketers to peacefully communicate and express their opinions to the public and the right of privacy at home g a buffer zone is a reasonable way to reconcile privacy interests and first amendment rights when picketing targets a specific residential property h an ordinance prohibiting the targeted picketing of homes has been upheld by the united states supreme court in frisby vs schulz 1988 487 us 474 and a three hundred 300 foot buffer zone has been upheld by a california court of appeal as a reasonable exercise of the citys legislative discretion in regulating such targeted picketing city of san jose v superior court of santa clara county 1995 32 cal app 4th 330 i this chapter is not intended to preclude the right to
