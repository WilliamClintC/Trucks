criteria title duties of officials the provisions of this article shall be known as and may be cited as the citys floodplain ordinance and all officials of the city having duties under these regulations are ordered and directed to perform such duties as required of them under these regulations ex a4231 1262006 findings of fact a the areas of special flood hazard in helotes are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage ex a4232 1262006 statement of purpose the purpose of this article is to promote land use controls necessary to qualify the city for flood insurance under requirements of the national flood insurance act of 1968 with provisions designed 1 to protect human life and property exposed to the hazards of flooding  2 to avoid increasing flood levels or flood hazards or creating new flood hazards areas  3 to minimize public and private property losses due to flooding  4 to preserve the natural floodplains where at all possible  5 to ensure that potential property owners are notified if property is in a special flood hazard area  6 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  7 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  8 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas  9 to minimize expenditure of future public money for costly flood control projects  areas  and 10 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas ex a4233 1262006 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restricts or prohibits uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause increases in flood heights or velocities  2 requires that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controls the alteration of natural floodplains their protective barriers and stream channels  4 prevents the construction of barriers that will divert floodwaters and subject other lands to greater flood hazards  5 controls development that would cause greater erosion or potential flood damage such as grading dredging excavation and filling  6 imposes a regulatory 100year floodplain that requires using the ultimate development of the watershed to determine the 100year water surface elevations new developments must be constructed above this elevation ex a 4234 1262006 special floodplain definition unless specifically defined below words or

promote a walkable and bikeable community when feasible coordinate pedestrian and bicycle circulation systems within a large site or to join two or more sites together 5 offstreet walkways the use of outdoor courtyards and patios is encouraged a paths which lead from parking areas to buildings should convey a progression of walking experiences throughout the site this progression comprised of spaces between parking areas outdoor spaces and buildings begins with walkways that lead from the street or parking areas b paths and walkways should be provided where feasible to connect parking areas to buildings and outdoor spaces 6 courtyards and outdoor spaces brick stone and interlocking pavers should be considered in courtyards adn outdoor spaces a when utilized outdoor use areas including patios courtyards and decks should be in character with the hill country they should reflect a modest lowkey quality and may occur in a variety of locations some may be in front of a building while others may be to the side or rear b incorporate an informal character into these areas c incorporating benches and other furniture is appropriate outdoor areas should be in character with the texas hill country d consider using a courtyard as a transitional element between buildings e brick stone stamped concrete and interlocking pavers should be considered in courtyards and outdoor spaces 7 fences and site walls a traditional fences and rock walls enhance the character of the area and should be preserved fences were typically wood rail relatively low in height and had a transparent character allowing views into yards and providing interest to pedestrians low rock walls were also used to define property lines or highlight an entry new fencing or site walls should be in character with those used traditionally if a new fence is constructed it should be transparent in character b new fencing should be transparent in character and reflect those seen traditionally c rock walls should remain low in scale and reflect those seen traditionally d unfaced concrete block or concrete plastic fiberglass rebar wrought iron plywood cyclone chain link and mesh construction fences are inappropriate 8 lighting a refer to city lighting ordinance rock walls were traditionally low in character b exterior lighting shall be full cutoff in order to preserve the rural character and protect the view of the night sky street lights should be placed randomly to avoid an urban appearance  however street lights should still provide adequate lighting at street intersections and

public lots should be screened and located away from the road edge where feasible large surface lots should be divided into smaller rooms c screen parking areas from view with landscaping d divide parking areas into smaller lots with planted buffers between them to minimize the perceived scale of the total parking area a parking area should have a positive visual impact e where feasible locate parking lots to the sides or rear of buildings f integrate existing mature trees into the parking design 10 mechanical equipment and service areas a locate mechanical equipment to the rear or sides of a property and screen them with landscaping if visible from public rightsofway b window air conditioning units or condenser elements should be located where they are not visible on a front faade c mechanical equipment should have a matte or nonreflective finish d satellite dishes or antennae should be located away from the front of a structure and if applicable placed into a landscaped setting e service areas should not be visible from major pedestrian ways or public rightsofway f trash areas should be screened from view using a fence landscaping or enclosure g all roof mounted mechanical equipment shall be screened from view from any public rightofway screening materials for rooftop equipment must be of a material architecturally compatible with the materials used elsewhere on the structure place an addition to the rear or side of a building b building additions 1 it is important to preserve and maintain the setting and character of traditional buildings in the area therefore an addition should be designed to maintain the existing character of the building as it is perceived from the street 2 where feasible keeping the size of the addition in proportion to the main structure will minimize its visual impact if an addition must be larger it could be set apart from the main building and connected with a smaller linking element consider designing the addition so that it complementsnot copiesthe existing building style 3 place an addition to the rear or side of a building or set it back from the front to minimize its visual impact 4 an addition should relate to the original structure in mass scale and form 5 when feasible design the addition so it appears subordinate to the main structure 6 for a larger addition break up the mass of the addition into smaller modules that relate to the traditional building 7 an addition should be simple and similar in design to prevent it from competing with the primary faade c rooftop additions 1 a rooftop addition should be subordinate to the main building additional space can be created by adding dormers to an attic or by adding a poptop or new floor 2 set a rooftop addition back from the front of the building so that it will maintain the structures original profile where feasible new buildings should be organized in clusters to create outdoor spaces such clustering of structures reflects rural development in the hill country d design standards for infill development 1 refer to city subdivision and zoning regulations for building setbacks building mass and building scale 2 this chapter presents design guidelines for the construction of new buildings or renovations in helotes these infill principles relate to the fundamental relationship between building and contextsuch as mass scale and form a key objective is that new developments continue to reinforce the lowkey rural town character structures should be designed to reflect the small scale of traditional building forms and materials while accommodating other larger permitted uses 3 building setbacks a building setbacks vary in helotes this diversity adds interest and should be continued to maintain the traditional relationship of buildings to the street b a building should fit within the range of front rear and side yard setbacks seen in the area c a prominent entry will contribute to the pedestrian friendly character of the street d use a porch or onestory element to define the entry e where two or more buildings will be located on a site arrange them in a cluster to define outdoor spaces 4 street level interest the use of display windows to provide interest to pedestrians and passersby is encouraged for commercial buildings a when a building is oriented to the street or parking area it should be designed to provide interest to pedestrians for example commercial buildings with storefronts are of interest to passersby while porches courtyards and decorative wall surfaces add interest to multiple building types b building facades viewed from public rightsofway or parking areas should include interesting details and materials to avoid presenting a back side to one street or parking area or another for example buildings that are doublefronted should incorporate windows and display cases on both elevations c a large expanse of blank wall is inappropriate on any public street parking area or outdoor space 5 building mass and scale divide large buildings into smaller modules that reflect the traditional scale of buildings in the area a design a new building to reinforce a sense of human scale the traditional scale of buildings usually designed as one and twostory buildings still dominates and enhances the hill country character of the street to the greatest extent possible new construction should maintain this human scale while new buildings are typically larger than those seen before they should be articulated in their form and material similar to those seen traditionally b use building materials that are of traditional dimensions c provide a porch or onestory element that is similar in size to that seen traditionally d subdividing the mass of a larger building into smaller modules that are similar in size to new buildings are lengthy or horizontal faade elements should reduce the proportion and the visual width of the building examples of those elements that give the impression of multiple structures include varying parapet heights alternating projecting and recessed sections of walls and variegated window arrangements further typical historic features that reduce the mass of large facades include columns or pilasters at regular intervals repetitive patterns of openings and horizontal masonry bands at each floor level in order to preserve the traditional scale of the area and maintain views to the hillsides buildings in the area should not be taller than two stories e a new building or addition should not be greater than two floors in height f floortofloor heights should appear similar to those seen traditionally 6 building materials a use building materials that appear similar to those used traditionally building materials on a new structure should be compatible with adjacent traditional buildings to establish a sense of visual continuity clay or concrete brick terracotta natural stone cast stone granite architectural decorative material copper bronze et cetera stucco or wood are appropriate b horizontal lap siding should be applied in a manner similar to that seen historically i it should match the lap exposure texture and finish of traditional wood siding ii trim boards that show substantial depth should be used iii wood siding should have a weatherprotective painted or stained finish iv use of a highly reflective material such as polished metal or stone is inappropriate the use of masonry that appears similar to that seen traditionally is appropriate c the use of masonry that appears similar to that seen traditionally is appropriate i the use of limestone similar to that used traditionally is encouraged ii the bond patterns mortar color and width and shape of joints should be compatible with traditional buildings in the area d contemporary interpretations of traditional building materials are appropriate contemporary interpretations of traditional building materials are appropriate notice the vertical double hung windows on the second story i if used contemporary materials should appear similar in character to those seen traditionally characteristics including color texture and size should be considered when utilizing contemporary materials ii stucco is appropriate as a secondary material iii a matte or nonreflective finish is preferred polished stone reflective metal and mirrored glass should be avoided e roof materials should convey a scale and texture similar to those used traditionally i roof materials should be earth toned and have a matte nonreflective finish ii nonreflective standing seam metal roofs are appropriate the seam profile should be similar to that seen traditionally iii many of the commercial structures in the hill country have flat roofs with parapet walls that extend above the roof this treatment is encouraged for new structures a projected cornice at the top of the parapet should be considered in the design of new buildings a cornice serves to screen roofs and mechanical equipment and provide architectural interest and historic character the use of limestone similar to that used traditionally is appropriate 7 porches a porch elements are strongly encouraged to provide shade to reflect traditional building scales and to provide a sense of entry and visual interest porch elements should be similar to those seen traditionally b a porch should relate to the overall architectural style and scale of the primary structure c the porch should appear to be an integral element of the building in regard to material scale and detailing d porch supports should be substantial enough in size that the porch does not appear to float above the entry a porch should relate to the overall architectural style and scale of

the area and even discourage customers security bars are acceptable only if installed on the interior of glass windows and doors vertically proportioned double hung windows are preferred 9 accessory structures a an accessory structure should be visually subordinate to a primary structure traditionally accessory structures such as sheds garages and other outbuildings were subordinate in scale and character to the primary structure and were located to the rear of the structure the tradition of detached accessory structures is encouraged because it reduces the overall perceived mass of a building on a site b locate an accessory structure to the sides or rear of a lot c an accessory structure should reflect the architectural character and style of the main structure d basic rectangular forms with hip gable or shed roofs are appropriate e accessory buildings should appear subordinate in height to primary structures 10 awnings and canopies a awnings and canopies serve a number of functions including providing shelter from wind and sun in pedestrian areas  protecting interior furnishings and finishes from fading caused by direct sunlight  allowing reflected light to enter the interior without increasing heat load  and adding architectural interest or historic ambiance to structures however the appropriateness of awnings to a buildings architectural style should be considered before installing them b location awnings and canopies may be placed at the top of openings but they should not hide important architectural details and elements c shape the shape of awnings and canopies should fit the shape of the openinground or arched awnings over arched openings and rectangular awnings over rectangular openings odd shapes bull nose awnings and bubble awnings are inappropriate for hill country structures d operable awnings operable awnings are encouraged but rigid frame awnings also may be considered e materials acceptable awning materials are canvas or woven acrylic over painted steel or anodized aluminum frames shiny vinyl or plastic fabrics should be avoided as should prefabricated metal awnings canopies should be constructed of a material consistent with the architecture f color the color of awnings and canopies should be compatible with the overall color scheme for the project g lighting internally illuminated awnings are discouraged indirect lighting is preferred 11 color a color can help to coordinate facade elements into an overall compositionone that will highlight features of the faade distinctive architectural elements may be dramatized with a contrasting color any color scheme should be subdued not garish and in keeping with the character and color schemes of nearby structures and the texas hill country b compatible trim color trim colors should be selected that are compatible with other more permanent building materials on the structure such as brick stone or stucco the natural colors of these primary materials should dominate the color scheme from the street c trim including horizontal and vertical trim boards porch framing and columns and window framing should be painted in a color that compliments the base shade window sashes doors andor shutters may be painted in a third color munsell color system wikipediacom d bright colors extremely bright or fluorescent exterior colors are discouraged bright
