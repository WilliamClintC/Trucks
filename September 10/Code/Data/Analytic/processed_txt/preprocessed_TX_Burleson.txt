decisionmaking bodies b design guidelines 1 the sign design guidelines are designed to help ensure quality signs that communicate their message in a clear fashion  however the guidelines are not as strict as sign standards the city council may interpret the design guidelines with some flexibility in their application to specific signsprojects as not all design criteria may be workable or appropriate for each sign or project in some circumstances one guideline may be relaxed to facilitate compliance with another guideline determined by the review authority to be more important in the particular case the overall objective is to ensure that the intent and spirit of the design guidelines are followed a compatibility with surroundings 1 proportional size and scale the scale of signs should be based on the building facade on which they are placed and the area in which they are located the size and shape of a sign should be proportional with the scale of the structure large storefronts such as big boxes will be allowed to have proportionally larger signs than smaller storefronts signs should not overwhelm the section of the building facade on which it is placed upon 2 integrate signs with the building signs should be designed so that they are integrated with the design of the building a well designed building facade or storefront is created by the careful coordination of sign and architectural design and a coordinated color scheme signs in multipletenant buildings should be designed to complement or enhance the other signs in the building sign placement and design should be reviewed within the context of building design 3 corporate franchise signage corporate franchise signage should conform to the communitys visual desires while maintaining some elements of corporate identity corporate logos should fit the context color scale and building elements b location and mounting 1 signs should be mounted in locations that respect the design of a building and site including the arrangement of bays and openings signs should not obscure windows including secondstory windows window trimmolding grillwork piers pilasters and other ornamental features 2 attached signs on fascias above storefront windows should be sized to fit within existing friezes lintels spandrels and other such features and not extend above below or beyond them typically attached signs should be centered on horizontal surfaces eg over a storefront opening 3 when a large building contains several storefronts signs for the individual businesses should relate well to each other in terms of locations height proportion color and illumination maintaining continuity will reinforce the buildings facade composition while still retaining each businesss identity c color 1 avoid using too many colors colors or color combinations that interfere with legibility of the sign copy or that interfere with viewer identification of other signs should be avoided 2 use contrasting colors contrast is an important influence on the legibility of signs a substantial contrast should be provided between the color and material of the background and the letters or symbols to make the sign easier to read in both day and night light letters on a dark background or dark letters on a light background are most legible light letters on a dark background work best for both day and night time use d materials 1 compatibility of materials sign materials should be compatible with the design of the facade on which they are placed consider the architectural design of the buildings facade and select materials that complement the design the selected materials should also contribute to the legibility of the sign for example glossy finishes are often difficult to read because of glare and reflections 2 appropriate materials sign materials should be extremely durable paper and cloth signs are not suitable for exterior use except on awnings because they deteriorate quickly if wood is used it should be properly sealed to keep moisture from soaking into the wood and causing the signs lettering to deteriorate e sign legibility 1 concise name identification a concise name or limited lines of copy should be used whenever possible given the limited amount of time the vehicle traveling public has to identify and read the sign the fewer number of words the more effective the sign a simple and succinct sign is easier to read and looks more attractive because it is less cluttered 2 use symbols and logos symbols and logos can be used in place of words whenever appropriate pictographic images will usually register more quickly in the viewers mind than a written message and they can be an expression of the owners creativity 3 limit the number of letter styles the number of lettering styles that are used on a sign should be limited in order to increase legibility as a general rule limit the number of different letter types to no more than two for small signs and three for larger signs intricate typefaces and symbols that are difficult to read reduce the signs ability to communicate f sign illumination 1 internal illumination individually illuminated letters either internally illuminated or backlit solid letters reverse channel are a preferred alternative to internally illuminated plastic cabinet signs signs comprised of individual letters mounted directly on a structure can often use a distinctive element of the structures facade as a backdrop thereby providing a better integration of the sign with the structure 2 use a projected light source signs along roadways with slower moving traffic or in pedestrianoriented environment should consider illumination by a projected light source eg spotlight projection lighting is usually a better alternative because the sign will appear to be integrated with the buildings architecture light fixtures supported in front of the sign cast light on the sign and generally a portion of the buildings face as well projected lighting emphasizes the continuity of the structures surface and signs become an integral part of the facade the use of small unobtrusive

not there is a need for expedited compliance with the municipal zoning ordinance and shall determine whether or not it is appropriate to set a date certain for the use or activity to come into compliance with the current requirements of the ordinance if the board determines that there is no need for expedited compliance it shall provide written notice to the party who requested the hearing that the board has found that expedited compliance is not necessary at the present time no further action shall be taken by the board and the nonconforming use shall retain its existing status any

the board shall give the various parties to an amortization case sufficient time to conduct discovery and to prepare evidence of value depreciation and income the standard position of the board shall be to establish a hearing date a minimum of 60 days following the determination of a need for expedited compliance the parties may exchange written discovery requests and take as appropriate depositions of potential witnesses discovery disputes will be presented to the chairman of the board for resolution the hearing to determine value and income matters relating to amortization shall be subject to the same notice requirements as those established for the expedited compliance hearing the purpose of the second hearing shall be to determine the value of the interest taken if any and whether the owner has had a reasonable opportunity to recoup that value the value is determined in the following manner 1 a determination is made based on the presentment of evidence of the initial investment made by the original owner in the construction and establishment of the nonconforming use land value is not a factor as the property owner or his successor will retain ownership and the right to use the land for a legal use the board should consider any evidence establishing the amount of the investment made in the establishment of the nonconforming use prior to the point in time at which it became legal nonconforming any improvement addition expansion or change made after the date of its legal nonconformity shall not be considered by the board as it was made by the owner with knowledge of the limited life expectancy and use of the property initial investment value shall not be given to items that may be transported to a new site compensation for these items is addressed as a relocation cost under subsection b7 the purpose of amortization value determination is to fully recognize the investment the owner made at the time that the use was legally permitted 2 the board next determines the date upon which the nonconforming use came into existence andor operation 3 the board shall then determine the income that the property has produced annually since the nonconforming use commenced the board at its discretion may make findings as to the annual operating cost of the nonconforming use to determine income over purely operating revenue the board shall prepare a written finding stating clearly for each year that the nonconforming use has been in existence the annual income it has produced and shall further make a finding of its current annual income based upon the income it produced at the close of the most recent calendar year for which it has been in operation if due to the age of the nonconforming use changes of ownership or the loss or destruction of records it is not possible to prepare an income finding for each year of the nonconforming use the board will make a finding for each year that can be documented and will note why the

determine whether the original investment in the nonconforming use is subject to depreciation due to physical andor market conditions the board shall look at standard industry practices in determining a reasonable depreciation schedule 5 the board shall then take the original investment value determined in step number 1 of this process and then subtract from that number the income of the

value less depreciation leaves a positive figure of value remaining in the tract the board shall make a determination that there is unamortized value in the nonconforming use that must be addressed by the city prior to expedited compliance if the subtraction of the income streams from the initial investment value produces a negative number then no unamortized value will remain and the city may proceed with establishing a date for expedited compliance without the need to address unamortized value 6 all findings of the board pertaining to the value of the investment in the nonconforming use and the rate of return derived by the owner must be reasonable and in accordance with accepted industry practices for that type of nonconforming use any party may offer evidence to the board in order

cost of relocation does not include the cost of removing permanent improvements such as buildings parking areas or public works facilities that will remain on the original site for use by the owner in a conforming business activity c board findings on unamortized value and the cost of relocation if the board has made a determination that unamortized value remains in the nonconforming use by determining that the original investment value minus depreciation exceeds the amount of income derived from the nonconforming use during its operation date of the amortization hearing the board shall make the following findings as a matter of record 1 the dollar value of the unamortized interest remaining in the nonconforming use original investment value minus depreciation and minus income earned during historic operation of the nonconforming use 2 the dollar income the nonconforming use produced during its last full calendar year of operation prior to the date of the hearing 3 the dollar cost of relocating business assets on inventory under b7 above 4 the calendar date upon which amortization shall be complete which shall be determined by dividing the unamortized value from step 1 by the current annual income of the nonconforming use set forth in 2 above the board shall then add the closure and relocation costs identified in b7 to determine the investment or cost to be amortized the calendar date determined herein shall be the date upon which the income from the nonconforming use is believed to have fully amortized the original investment value of the nonconforming use together with the closurerelocation costs that are properly chargeable to the nonconforming use the board shall make these findings matters of record in the minutes of the board meeting in which such final determination was reached the date upon which final amortization occurs findings 4 as set forth above shall be the date upon which the legal nonconforming use shall cease to operate in a nonconforming

discretion shall have the right to determine if the city should appropriate funds to purchase the remaining unamortized value of the nonconforming use thereby instituting immediate closure rather than

development including higherdensity condominiums and apartments in the range of 20 dwelling units per acre and townhomebrownstone and other single family development in the 715 dwelling units per acre range the layout of the overall acreage focuses on neighborhood centers connected by sidewalks paths and public trails in the parks open spaces and creek areas the type of development encourages walking and the compact nature of the development provides for short walking distances from the future rail station site to areas devoted to live work and play alsbury boulevard and shaffstall road are critical elements of the success of the tod through the tod these roadways will be designed with a unique crosssection a european boulevard is envisioned so that pedestrian friendly areas and high volume low speed travel lanes travel lanes can be created and complement each other in the overall design within the tod the goal is to construct these arterials as a feature of and integrated with the development rather than a barrier between two different mixeduse developments outside the limits of the tod these roadways will be typical boulevards or undivided roadways with a center turn lane
