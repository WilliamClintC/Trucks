circulation system will result in new development causing unacceptable levels of congestion on the arterials highways and freeways of the regional system c the city council also finds and declares that in the absence of this chapter imposing a fairshare traffic fee upon new development existing and future sources of revenue are inadequate to fund substantial portions of the regional transportation system improvements needed to avoid unacceptable levels of congestion and related adverse impacts caused by new development  1 eff  as amended by  1 eff    eff 5152009 purpose a the

has determined the extent to which the new development of land will generate traffic volumes impacting the roadway system and that this chapter establishes a fair and equitable method for distributing unfunded costs of transportation improvements necessary to accommodate traffic volumes generated by such development  2 eff  as amended by  1 eff    eff 5152009 specific findings the need for regional

study prepared by the merced county association of governments whose governing board is composed of city council members and county supervisors from the countys six 6 cities and the county board of supervisors the study has established that growth to the year 2030 will affect the entire regional transportation system and therefore that the area of impact for future development is appropriately the entire county of merced the study made the following additional findings a population and employment within the county of merced is anticipated to increase by ninetyeight 98% percent and eightytwo 82% percent respectively by the year 2030 and will result in levels of service e and f as defined in the highway capacity manual 6th edition on existing arterials highways and freeways b the regional transportation plan mcag 2007 modeled and evaluated the effect of projected growth to the year 2030 on all major arterials highways and freeways in merced county and found that without expansion the transportation system would suffer severe congestion further the plan showed that the recommended transportation improvements would accommodate the traffic anticipated in the year 2030 at the desired level of service d c existing and future sources of public revenues are insufficient to fund all the needed transportation improvements d the revenues generated by this regional transportation impact fee will provide additional funds necessary to construct the transportation improvements and will help provide the additional capacity needed in the year 2030 to accommodate the traffic generated by

sewage disposal purposes in accordance with the principal activity conducted upon the premises as determined by the city engineer the purpose of classification is to facilitate the regulation of waste water dischargers based on quality quantity and flow to provide an effective means of industrial waste source control and to establish a system of sewage disposal service charges based upon the flow and waste strength which will insure an equitable recovery of city capital and operating costs b calculation of user charges all dischargers shall pay a user charge for city sewage disposal services the charges will reflect the quantity quality and flow of the waste water of the dischargers and will be based on city capital and operating costs to collect treat and dispose of waste water additionally all industrial dischargers shall pay their share of the total amount of the grant fund awarded divided by a thirty 30 year period the determination of each industrial users share of the grant funded facilities shall be determined by the utilization of unit rate formulas which are in compliance with subsection 1 of subsection b of of the federal water pollution control acts amendments of 197 in particular  and 13 copies of said sections of said act are on file with the city clerk such unit charge formulas are essentially as set forth in the revenue program attached as appendix b to the city of los banos amended projected report for sewage disposal system enlargement dated february 197 corrected to agree with the federal water pollution control acts amendments of 1972 and the final amount of the grant as estimated during the interim period of construction and as determined to be the final grant amount at the end of the construction period flat charges and unit charges shall be established by the city from time to time and set forth in a schedule of rates and charges unit charges will be established for each element of waste water strength which incurs city costs of collection treatment and disposal commencing on  such elements will be biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids unit charges for additional elements including chemical oxygen demand may be established from time to time as the city incurs additional costs for collection treatment and disposal a unit charge for volume also will be established which reflects city costs of collection treatment and disposal of the total volume of waste water the total sewage disposal charge for each discharger shall be calculated as follows 1 dischargers from residential premises with four or less dwelling units a uniform flat monthly charge per dwelling unit for sewage disposal service will be made to dischargers of waste water in this class regardless of the source of water except for mobile home subdivisions 2 dischargers from residential premises with five or more dwelling units and dischargers from nonresidential premises all dischargers of waste water in this class will be assigned a business classification code depending on the principal activity conducted on the premises except for mobile home subdivisions which will be classed as residential all dischargers conducting the same principal activity and discharging similar flows and loadings will receive the same business classification code the city engineer shall determine the typical waste water strength for each business classification code and each discharger within that classification will be assumed for sewage disposal charge purposes to have the same typical waste water strength a classification charge shall be established by the city for each business classification code which will be based on the unit charges for the elements of waste water strength including volume as applied to the typical waste water strength of the particular classification the sewage disposal charge to a discharger in this class will be calculated by multiplying the classification charge by the volume of water used by the discharger any discharger in this class who is issued a waste water discharge permit will thereafter pay a sewage disposal charge as a permit discharger 3 permit dischargers dischargers of waste water who arc required to obtain a permit under the provisions of this chapter excluding permits issued solely for flow estimation shall pay a sewage disposal charge which shall be the sum of the products of the following the unit charge for each element of waste water strength multiplied by the estimated or measured amount per volume of water of each element multiplied by the volume of water used  and the unit charge for volume multiplied by the volume of water used as determined herein the sewage disposal charge for permit dischargers including both waste water strength and water use shall be calculated by an apportionment by the city engineer of strength and use to each building sewer at the dischargers premises dischargers requiring permits solely for flow estimation shall pay a sewage disposal charge calculated by multiplying the classification charge by the volume of water determined by the estimation in addition to a sewage disposal charge the permit discharger shall pay all applicable city permit charges commencing on  all dischargers required to obtain a permit shall pay a sewage disposal charge in accordance with their business classification code until a permit is issued dischargers receiving flow estimations on  shall apply and be issued a permit before the expiration of the existing flow estimate c determinations of water used the applicable volume of water upon which sewage disposal charges shall be based will be determined as follows 1 water discharged to sewers for premises where no portion of the water received from any source is consumed in the principal activity of the discharger or removed from the premises by means other than sewers the sewage disposal charge shall be applied against the total amount of water used from all sources the amount of city water received will be determined from city records the amount of water used from other sources will be determined by means of a meter installed at the expense of the discharger and approved by the city or by an estimate prepared by the city after obtaining a permit in accordance with this chapter the discharger shall report to the city the sources of all water used at his premises other than that supplied by the city and shall notify the city of any changes in such sources 2 water not discharged to city sewers for premises where a portion of the water received from any source does not flow into sewers because of the principal activity of the discharger or removal by other means the charge for sewage disposal service will be applied against the volume of water discharging from such premises into sewers written notification and proof of the diversion of water shall be provided by the discharger if he is to avoid the application of the sewage disposal charge against the total amount of water used from all sources he may be required to install a meter of a type and at a location approved by the city at his own expense to determine the quantity of water flowing into the sewers however where it is impractical to install meters and where the quantity of water diverted from the sewers amounts to more than twenty 20% percent of the total water used the charge for sewage disposal services may be based upon an estimate prepared by the city after obtaining a permit in accordance with this chapter  2 eff  waste water discharge permits a permits required
