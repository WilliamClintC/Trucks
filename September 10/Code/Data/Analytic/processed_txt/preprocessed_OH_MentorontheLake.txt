1reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows slowing the velocity of flood waters and regulating base flow 2assist in stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce woody debris from fallen or damaged trees streambank erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourse banks 3reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by filtering settling and transforming pollutants already present in watercourses 4reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering settling and transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses 5provide watercourse habitats with shade and food 6reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain a diverse aquatic system 7provide riparian habitat to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian vegetation 8benefit the city by minimizing encroachment on watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering solutions such as gabion baskets and rip rap to protect structures and reduce property damage and threats to the safety of residents  and by contributing to the scenic beauty and environment of the city and thereby preserving the character of the
