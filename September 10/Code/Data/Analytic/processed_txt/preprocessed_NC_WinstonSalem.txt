pollution control  floodway regulation  planning and regulation of development   51908 findings it is hereby determined that 1 development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding soil erosion stream channel erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and sediment transport and deposition as well as reducing groundwater recharge  2 these changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and alterations in hydrology which are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment  3 these effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and wellplanned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development and redevelopment sites  and 4 the federal water pollution control act of 1972 clean water act and federal phase ii stormwater rules promulgated under it as well as rules of the north carolina environmental management commission promulgated in response to federal phase ii requirements compel certain urbanized areas including the city to adopt the minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this ordinance therefore the citys council establishes this ordinance to regulate the quality and quantity of stormwater runoff and discharge to meet the state and federal requirements  51908 purpose a general the purpose of this ordinance is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post construction stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with development and redevelopment it has been determined that proper management of constructionrelated and post construction stormwater runoff can safeguard the public health safety and general welfare  minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure  and protect water and aquatic resources this ordinance is intended to not contradict the intent or direction of the legacy comprehensive plan b specific this ordinance seeks to meet its general purpose following specific objectives and means 1 establish decisionmaking processes and standards for development and redevelopment that protects the integrity of watersheds and preserves the health of water resources  2 require that new development and redevelopment maintain the preconstruction hydrologic response in their post construction state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storms in order to reduce flooding streambank erosion point and nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3 establish minimum post construction stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4 establish design and review criteria for the construction function and use of structural bmps that may be used to meet the minimum post construction stormwater management standards  5 encourage the use of low impact site design practices such as the use of vegetated stormwater conveyances and the preservation of green space and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable  6 establish provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of the stormwater management systems to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained appropriately and pose no threat to public safety or public health  7 establish administrative procedures for the submission review and approval of stormwater management systems for the inspection of approved projects and to assure appropriate longterm maintenance  8

proving that the variance would permit a greater profit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify the board in granting a variance moreover the board shall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of these standards that will make possible the reasonable use of property 2 the hardship results from the application of these standards to the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship 3 the hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicants property such as its size shape or topography which is different from that of neighboring property procedures specific development applications winstonsalemforsyth county udo 363 last updated  italics text applicable in winstonsalem

property after  and then comes to the board for relief 5 the hardship is peculiar to the applicants property rather than the result of conditions that are widespread if other properties are equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction then granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to others and would not promote equal justice ii the variance is in harmony with the

and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in floodprone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards b statement of purpose it is the purpose of these standards to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within floodprone areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands c objectives the objectives of these standards are to 1 protect human life safety and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally

regulate or control vehicular or pedestrian traffic on a street or highway under the control of the board of transportation however gs 153a341 and our local act provide that zoning regulations shall be designed to lessen congestion in the streets and to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation these standards are intended to provide the citycounty planning board and all other local elected and appointed boards located within forsyth county the information necessary to make informed decisions regarding planned development impacts to traffic on their roads by adopting these standards the citycounty planning board seeks to ensure that a all decisions regarding traffic impacts due to development are based upon technical study and b needed improvements are made in a cost effective and efficient manner the citycounty planning department ccpb and the winstonsalem department of transportation wsdot andor the north carolina department of transportation ncdot may review
