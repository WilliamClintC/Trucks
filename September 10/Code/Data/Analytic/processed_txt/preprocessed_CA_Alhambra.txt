planning commission and the city council have caused to be prepared approved and adopted a general community plan for the city in conformity with the requirements of the california community redevelopment law bthe planning commission and other city agencies have also made extensive investigations and comprehensive surveys which disclose that blighted areas exist within the city and which constitute either social or economic liabilities or both requiring redevelopment in the interest of the health safety and general welfare of the people of the city in particular and the people of the state generally the blighted areas are characterized by one or more of the following conditions 1the existence of buildings and structures either used or intended to be used for living commercial industrial or other purposes or any combination of such uses which by reason of age obsolescence deterioration dilapidation mixed character or shifting of uses to which they are put or any combination of such factors and characteristics are unsuitable for occupation for existing residential commercial industrial or other purposes 2in such blighted areas economic dislocation deterioration or disuse exist as a result of faulty planning 3in some areas depreciated values impaired investments and economic maladjustments exist to such an extent that capacity to pay taxes is reduced and tax receipts are inadequate in relation to the cost of public services rendered 4the existence of blighted areas characterized by any or all of such conditions separately or collectively constitutes a serious and growing menace which is injurious and inimical to the public health safety and welfare of the people of the city in particular and to the people of the state generally csuch areas present difficulties and handicaps which are beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory processes in the exercise of the police power they contribute substantially and increasingly to the problems of and necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures for the preservation of the public health and safety and the maintaining of adequate police fire and accident protection and other public services and facilities the benefits which will result from the remedying of these conditions and the redevelopment of these areas of blight will accrue to all the inhabitants and property owners in the city dsuch conditions of blight tend to cause further obsolescence deterioration and disuse because of the lack of incentive to the individual landowner and his inability to improve modernize or rehabilitate his own particular property while the condition of the neighboring properties remains unchanged as a consequence the process of deterioration of a blighted area frequently cannot be halted or corrected except by redeveloping the entire area or substantial portions thereof in most instances the lands are held in divided and widely scattered ownerships in many such instances it is so difficult and costly that it is uneconomic and as a practical matter impossible for individual owners independently or collectively to undertake to remedy such conditions because of lack of the legal power necessary for and the excessive costs involved in the private acquisition of the real property of the area 86  passed      declaration of policy for the reasons set forth herein the following is hereby declared to be the policy of the city ait is the citys intent to protect and promote sound development and redevelopment of blighted areas within the city and the general welfare of the inhabitants of the community by remedying such injurious conditions employment of all means appropriate for that purpose  bwhenever the redevelopment of blighted areas cannot be accomplished by private enterprise alone without public participation and assistance in the acquisition of land in planning and in the financing of land assembly in the work of clearance and in the making of improvements necessary therefor it is in the public interest to employ the power of eminent domain to advance or expend public funds for these purposes and to provide a means whereby the blighted areas within the city may be redeveloped or rehabilitated  cthe redevelopment of such blighted areas and the provision for appropriate continuing land use and construction policies therein constitute public uses and purposes for which public money should be advanced or expended and private property acquired and are governmental functions of state and municipal concern in the interest of the health safety and welfare of the people of the state generally and of the people of the city in which such areas exist in particular  dit is in the public interest that work on such projects be commenced as

and findings athe practice of fortunetelling as defined in this chapter has historically been subject to abuse by certain unscrupulous practitioners using the practice to commit fraud and larceny upon clients bit is the purpose of this chapter to regulate the practice of fortunetelling in such a manner as to reduce the risk of fraud and larceny to clients while allowing fortunetellers to provide their services to clients with only minimal restrictions cthe provisions of this chapter requiring a permit posting of fees providing receipts and allowing client recordation of the consultation will make it more difficult for an unscrupulous fortuneteller to commit fraud or larceny and yet as informational regulations will not affect the nature of the information conveyed by the fortuneteller nor the manner in which it is conveyed these regulations require only minimal expense and effort on the part of the fortuneteller and will not therefore impose any undue burden on their practices dfortunetelling for entertainment purposes as defined in this chapter does not create the same risk of fraud and larceny by an unscrupulous practitioner as would the practice with an individual client because it is done with a group at a public place for the purpose of entertaining and not to deal with the private concerns of an individual efor these and other reasons the provisions of this chapter

gutters catch basins andor street paving presently exist as a result thereof the public has been and will continue to be deprived of public rightofway improvements of the minimum standards necessary for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian access and travel bthe city has experienced substantial increases in population and land development for high density and high activity purposes as a direct result thereof the previously existing public rightofway improvements within much of the city in many instances have been and will continue to be rendered inadequate to provide minimum acceptable service capacity for the lands being developed within the city and the public has been and will continue to be increasingly denied public rightofway improvements of the minimum standards necessary for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian access and travel within the city cthe lack of adequate sidewalks in the city in many instances forces pedestrians particularly school children to walk in the street and be subjected to the hazards of vehicular traffic dthe lack of adequate catch basins curbs and gutters in the city causes poor drainage causes the standing of water in puddles renders street sweeping more difficult and results in the accumulation of filth in the absence of such curbs and gutters there is no adequate place for garbage and rubbish receptacles as a result of which such containers are subjected to hazards of vehicular traffic and there is an unnecessary spillage of garbage and destruction of containers further the lack of such curbs and gutters subjects children or pedestrians in the normal sidewalk area to increased risk of accidental injury by vehicular traffic ethe lack of adequate street lighting reduces night visibility and makes it

of sewage generated and discharged by the larger buildings to the system the purpose of this chapter is to establish a means of providing adequate sewers which are required for the redevelopment of the city  to establish a charge to be collected from the properties that propose to discharge into the public sewer quantities of sewage in excess of the quantity for which the system was designed  and to establish an account within the sewer fund in which these charges may be deposited and from which moneys will be available for the sanitary sewer reconstruction program 86  passed      master
