sensitive areas areas of environmental sensitivity and potential application of the ed overlay district may be established by the citys comprehensive development plan 42 process subdivisions in an ed overlay district generally follow the approval procedures outlined in establishing the process for preliminary and final plat approval projects which do not require subdivision follow approval procedures appropriate to the specific project including special use permits zoning amendments site plan review or other applicable measures the requirements and standards included in this section are in addition to those established procedures 43 permitted density yield developments in ed overlay districts are permitted the same density on developable area as would be allowed to conventional

contained in the county soil survey published by the usda natural resources conservation service 2 secondary conservation areas secondary conservation areas comprise at least 35 percent of the net developable area and shall be designated and permanently protected full density credit shall be allowed for land in this category that would otherwise be buildable under local state and federal regulations so that their development potential is not reduced by this designation such density credit may be applied to other unconstrained parts of the site secondary conservation areas are determined by specific project design and typically include all or some of the following kinds of resources a a 100foot deep greenway buffer along all waterbodies and watercourses and a 50foot greenway buffer alongside wetlands soils classified as very poorly drained in the medium intensity county soil survey of the usda natural resources conservation service these areas must be conserved as secondary conservation areas but are considered as developable areas for the purpose of calculating yield b 100year floodplains c woodlands individual specimen trees or small stands of significant trees d aquifer recharge areas and areas with highly permeable excessively drained soil e significant wildlife habitat areas f class i and class ii farmlands g historic archaeological or cultural features listed or eligible to be listed on the national register of historic places or the historic resources surveys of the nebraska state historical society h slopes in excess of 15% i ridgelines

pedestrian access to the open space from all lots not adjoining the open space shall be provided except in the case of farmland or other resource areas vulnerable to trampling damage or human disturbance where the undivided open space is designated as separate noncontiguous parcels no parcel shall consist of less than three 3 acres in area nor have a s u b d i v i s i o n o r d i n a n c e 17 lengthtowidth ratio in excess of  except such areas that are specifically designed as village greens ballfields upland buffers to wetlands waterbodies or watercourses or trail links b interconnection of open spaces protected open spaces in each new subdivision are encouraged to adjoin each other ultimately forming an interconnected network of primary and secondary conservation areas across the county the only elements of the network that would necessarily be open to the public are those lands that have been required to be dedicated for public use and typically configured in a linear fashion as an element of plattsmouths longrange open space network comprehensive development plan 47 special processes for conservation developments the review and approval process for

applicants shall be prepared to demonstrate to the zoning administrator that these four design steps were followed in the preparation of the plan 1 step one designating the open space during the first step all potential conservation areas both primary and secondary as defined above are identified using the existing features plan 2 step two location of house sites during the second step potential house sites are located subdivision applicants shall identify tentative house sites on the conceptual preliminary plan and proposed house sites on the detailed final plan house sites should generally be located not closer than 100 feet from primary conservation areas but may be situated within 50 feet of secondary conservation areas in order to enjoy views of the latter without negatively

41 use matrix levels of permission include a uses that are permitted by right these uses are permitted subject to issuance of a building permit by the building official subject only to compliance with all regulations of this ordinance uses permitted by right might be subject to supplemental regulations contained in this ordinance these uses are indicated in the use matrix by a p in the applicable cell b special uses these uses are subject to approval of a special use permit by the city council following recommendation of the planning commission and the procedure set forth in these uses are indicated in the use matrix by a s in the applicable cell c site plan approval some use types require an additional site plan approval by the zoning administrator building official based on specific criteria for review this procedure is set forth in these uses are indicated in the use matrix by an asterisk  following the citing of a specific use type 413 guide to site development regulators the regulators set forth in the tables in establish the limits and requirements for most development in the city of plattsmouth and its extraterritorial jurisdiction this section is intended to provide guidance for applying the regulators contained in these tables a site area per housing unit this indicates the gross land area per unit within a residential development for example a 40lot subdivision on a 10acre 435600 square foot tract will have a site area per unit of 10890 square feet site area per unit which measures gross density may differ from minimum lot size in conservation development the site area per unit will be larger than minimum lot size permitting the clustering of lots in exchange for common open space in multifamily development the site area per unit will usually be smaller than minimum lot size because the lot is the legal parcel on which a multipleunit building is built b minimum lot area this indicates the minimum size of a legally described and recorded parcel upon which development can take place as noted above minimum lot area and site area per unit may not be the same c minimum lot width this is the required minimum distance connecting at points along opposite side lot lines measured at the required front yard setback for example the lot width of an irregular lot in a district requiring a 25foot front yard setback is determined by 1 locating the points along each side lot line at a distance of 25 feet back from the front property line z o n i n g d i s t r i c t s 44 2 drawing a line connecting these two points 3 measuring the length of this line the length is the lot width d minimum yards these define the required setbacks of buildings from front side and rear property lines while the yard requirements apply to a majority of development the ordinance provides for a number of exceptions some of these include 1 planned unit developments front yard setbacks may be varied within planned unit developments which are reviewed and approved by the city council after a recommendation from the planning commission 2 major streets the city may require greater than normal setbacks along segments of the citys arterial street system as defined in the comprehensive development plan 3 flexibility provided by supplemental development regulations establishes supplemental regulations many of which provide flexibility or variations in setback regulations for specific contexts e maximum setbacks some specific zoning districts provide maximum as well as minimum setbacks these setbacks establish buildto lines that may be necessary to protect the appearance and character of special urban districts f maximum height height normally measures the vertical distance from the established grade to the highest point of a building however as established by the definition of height the point of measurement may vary for different types of buildings and roof slopes g maximum building coverage this measures the percentage of a site that may be covered by the footprint of buildings thus a 20000 square foot building on a 40000 square foot site has a building coverage of 50 percent this is a method of regulating the scale of buildings in an area h maximum impervious coverage this measures the percentage of a site that may be covered by buildings and other surfaces and development features which prevent the penetration of water into the ground such as driveways porches parking lots and other features limits on impervious coverage help control the velocity and quantity of stormwater runoff and provide for groundwater recharge i floor area ratio just as site area per unit controls the density of residential development floor area ratio far controls the density of nonresidential development far is the ratio of gross floor area of a building to total site area thus in an area with a maximum permitted far of 10 a 40000 square foot building may be located on a 40000 square foot site naturally because of coverage ratios landscaping and parking requirements such a building will be multistory j maximum amount of total parking in street yard this controls the maximum amount of parking that can be located in the area between a building facade and the street when applied in certain zoning districts it is intended to reduce the number of cars seen from the street encourage site planning which locates parking in rear and side yards and produce a stronger relationship between buildings and streets for example a project with 100 parking stalls and a 50 percent limit on the amount of parking located in street yards must locate 50 of its stalls in rear or side yards without street exposure k minimum depth of landscaping adjacent to street rightofways this establishes the depth of landscaping that must be provided on private property adjacent and in from the rightofway line thus if the required minimum depth is 15 feet a project must landscape the first 15 feet of its site back from the rightofway line all landscaping must be done in accordance with establishing landscaping standards z o n i n g d i s t r i c t s 45 l minimum bufferyard requirements this establishes the depth of a bufferyard that must be provided by intensive land uses adjacent to primarily residential land uses in residential zoning districts all landscaping must be done in accordance with establishing landscaping standards m

adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the public health safety and general welfare the legislature in to 311022 rrs 194 has further assigned the responsibility to adopt administer and enforce floodplain management regulations to the county city or village with zoning jurisdiction over the floodprone area b purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in by applying the provisions of this ordinance to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction 3 protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuitable for intended purposes because of flood hazard 4 assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the national flood insurance program when identified by the federal insurance administration as a floodprone community c floodplainfloodway overlay districts findings of fact 1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation flood hazard areas of the city of plattsmouth nebraska are subject to inundation which results in loss of life or property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare a general causes of these flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities o v e r l a y d i s t r i c t s 522 2 the occupancy of flood areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages b methods used to analyze flood hazards this ordinance uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a base flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this ordinance is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a 1 percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated in the federal emergency management administrations flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary and floodway map or any subsequent effective flood insurance studies rate maps and flood boundary and floodway maps issued after the effective date of this ordinance and adopted by the city of plattsmouth 2 calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood 3 computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height 5 delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood 2 land to which this ordinance shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city of plattsmouth identified on the current flood insurance rate map firm as numbered and unnumbered a

interpretation of district boundaries the boundaries of the floodway and floodway fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions the enforcement officer shall make the necessary interpretation in such cases where the interpretation is contested the board of adjustment will resolve the dispute the base flood elevation
