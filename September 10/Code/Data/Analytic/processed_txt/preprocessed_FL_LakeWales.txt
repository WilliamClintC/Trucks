section unless the context clearly indicates otherwise emergency sinking account checking saving andor investments accounts nondiscretionary spending spending that is required by a contract or other commitment operating expenditures appropriated financial resources necessary for the operational costs excluding a capital expenditures  b debt service  203246 c depreciationamortization  and d transfers to other funds  71911  2551 creation of reserve accounts there is hereby created in each of the various governmental fund types general fund special revenue funds debt service funds and capital projects funds and proprietary fund type enterprise funds of the city reserve accounts equal to the following  1  general fundemergency sinking account in the general fund there shall be created an emergency sinking account with a lower limit of fifteen 15 percent and an upper limit of twenty 20 percent of general fund operating expenditures calculated based on the original adopted fiscal year budget the purposes of the sinking account shall be a to advance the funds necessary to pay for nondiscretionary expenses such as payroll and insurance premiums that must be paid during the first quarter of the fiscal year and that will be reimbursed when ad valorem revenues are received  and b to advance the funds necessary to pay for construction of grantfunded projects that will be reimbursed by federal or state agencies  and c to advance financial resources necessary for responding to emergencies that will be reimbursed by insurance proceeds or grants from fema or other federal or state agencies  and d to mitigate current and future revenue shortfalls unanticipated expenditures and to ensure stable tax rates 2 special revenue funds by definition special revenue funds are created to account for the proceeds of specific revenue sources other than expendable trusts or for major capital projects that are legally committed to expenditure for specified purposes as such no specific reservation of funds is created by virtue of enactment of this division  rather the amount of any reservation of funds shall be governed by the legal authority underlying the commitment 3 debt service fund debt service funds are typically subjected to the creation of very specific committed amounts as a part of the ordinance or resolution which authorizes the issuance of the debt instrument which is being repaid therefore this policy does not create any specific reservation of funds within the debt service fund  rather reserve requirements for any outstanding city debt instruments will be as derived from the ordinance or resolution authorizing the issuance of the debt 4 capital projects fund the capital projects fund was created to account for financial resources to be used for the acquisition and construction of major capital facilities and improvements occasionally these projects may extend beyond a single fiscal year at a minimum at fiscal yearend committed funds coupled with estimated revenues for the ensuing fiscal year must be sufficient to fund all outstanding fund obligations 5 utility systememergency sinking account in the utility system fund there shall be created an emergency sinking account with a lower limit of fifteen 15 percent and an upper limit of twenty 20 percent of utility system operating expenses based on the original adopted fiscal year budget the purposes of the sinking account shall be 204246 a to advance the funds necessary to pay for construction of grantfunded projects that will be reimbursed by federal or state agencies  and b to advance financial resources necessary for responding to emergencies that will be reimbursed by insurance proceeds or grants from fema or other federal or state agencies  and c to mitigate current and future revenue shortfalls unanticipated expenditures and to ensure stable fee structure  71911  2552 surplus in the event the emergency sinking account balance exceeds the amounts set forth within the upper limit the surplus may be utilized for any lawful purpose the following priorities are recommended 1  reduction or avoidance of debt if there is shortterm debt within the fund the surplus may be applied to reduce or eliminate the debt if financial analysis proves this to be advantageous for the city 2 onetime capital needs since a surplus does not represent a recurring source of revenue it should not be used to fund a recurring expense  however if a onetime capital expenditure has been identified but is not already funded appropriation the surplus may be appropriated for this use 3 tax fee or rate stabilization surplus funds may be designed for stabilization in order to avoid raising taxes fees or rates related to a fund in subsequent years  71911  2553 shortfall if it is determined there is a shortfall an amount below the lower limit of the sinking account range the sinking account balance is to be rebuilt following mechanism an appropriation during the next annual budget process of at least ten 10 percent of the lower limit of the sinking account range until the lower limit has been reached if this is financially infeasible a written plan shall be forwarded by the city manager to the commission for approval in order to restore the sinking account balance to an amount within the range within a reasonable time frame the plan may require reduction of services increases in taxes fees or rates or some combination thereof  71911 division 4 debt policy  2571 short title this division shall be known as and referred to as the lake wales debt policy  2513 205246  2572 introduction one of the most important responsibilities of a city is to ensure that the needs of its citizens are met the city commissions preferred method of funding is payasyougo capital planning as with all purchases if the city were able to purchase capital items without the use of financing options this would result in the lowest overall cost but the greatest single annual cash flow decrease the issuance of debt has historically provided governments with a major source of funding for capital needs because of the high cost of acquiring or replacing capital assets governments are often not in a position to be able to accumulate enough cash from current receipts to pay for necessary improvements debt permits governments to acquire assets as needed rather than wait until a sufficient amount of cash has been accumulated to begin capital projects or improvements debt issuance is subject to close public scrutiny because it involves raising large amounts of money which obligates future generations of taxpayers the decision to issue debt has farreaching consequences by committing the citys revenues for future periods and hence limiting the citys flexibility in responding to changing service priorities revenue inflows or cost structures the debt issuance process is complex  therefore it is important that city officials recognize the need to understand and formalize a process in order to make informed and objective judgments with respect to the many decisions that are necessary to successfully complete a debt transaction the foundation of any wellmanaged debt program is a comprehensive debt policy a debt policy sets forth the parameters for issuing and managing debt and provides guidance to decision makers helping to ensure that debt is issued prudently and is affordable a debt policy recognizes a longterm binding commitment to full and timely repayment of all debt as an intrinsic requirement for entry into the capital markets adherence to a debt policy helps to ensure that the city maintains a sound debt position and that its credit quality is protected a debt policy is beneficial because it enhances the quality of decisions rationalizes the decisionmaking process identifies objectives to be implemented and demonstrates a commitment to longterm financial planning objectives a consistently applied debt policy provides evidence to the rating agencies of a communitys commitment to sound financial management and controlled borrowing practices as such it is regarded positively in evaluating a citys creditworthiness it is important that the debt policy be reviewed and updated on a regular basis to insure the use of the citys resources to meet its commitment to provide needed services to its citizens and to maintain sound financial management practices  2513  2573 purpose the city of lake wales debt policy debt policy is intended to establish a framework for debt issuance and to provide general direction in the planning implementation and maintenance of the citys debt program the debt policy is designed to 1 promote attainment of financial planning and management objectives  2 take a comprehensive approach to affordability  3 reflect the community attitudes and government philosophy  and 4 set limits while preserving flexibility 206246 the debt policy will provide guidance to city officials on how to integrate the issuance of debt with other longterm planning financial and management objectives  evaluate the impact of each issue on the citys overall financial position  and provide guidance so as not to exceed acceptable levels of indebtedness while the debt policy establishes a framework for debt issuance it is written to be sufficiently flexible to permit the city to take advantage of market opportunities and to respond to changing conditions without jeopardizing essential public services  2513  2574 purpose for which debt may be issued the city will consider longterm financing for the acquisition maintenance replacement or expansion of physical assets including land with a useful life of at least five 5 years the repayment term of any debt should not exceed seventy 70 percent of the assets estimated useful life example if the estimated use life of an asset is ten 10 years the debt issuance for this item should not exceed seven 7 years in the situation of multiple assets being financed within one 1 debt issuance an averaging of the multiple estimated useful lives and variable costs shall be considered by the city commission relating to the debt financing terms for both reasonableness and cost efficiency the city normally will rely on internally generated funds andor grants and contributions from other governments to finance its capital needs debt will be issued for a capital project only in the case of emergency or when it is an appropriate means to achieve a fair allocation of costs between current and future beneficiaries debt shall not in general be used for projects solely because insufficient funds are budgeted at the time of acquisition or construction  2513  2575 moral obligation pledges recognizing that a citys potential can be measured by the service delivery of its infrastructure it is the responsibility of the citys officials to 1 recognize the citys limited inventory of pledgable revenues and the need to manage the usecommitment of these revenues as the consumption of a scarce resource   2  maintain the current systems structures and facilities and their service delivery potential and to add building blocks additions modifications and expansion as needed  3  ensure that decision making with regard to city debt will focus on the need to measure interperiod equity between fiscal years and generations of taxpayers users and other beneficiaries take actions to ensure the fair distribution of costs between periods while equally striving to maintain future flexibility to address unanticipated capital requirements  4  employ the use of debt to complement and not in lieu of significant recurring commitments of annual appropriations for capital purposes  5 act as fiduciaries for their time as responsible officials to ensure that each transfers to their successors a city in at least as good a shape financial physical service delivery potential etc as they received from their predecessors  and 207246 6 maintain the citys sound financial position reasonable reserves and positive debt posture and thereby enhance the citys flexibility and related ability to meet the challenges of its future generations  2513  2576 categorization of debt a selfsupporting debt to be considered selfsupporting a propriety or governmental debt program will 1 be payable exclusively from nongeneral fund revenues  and 2 in the case of governmental debt be secured by a revenue source which has been in effect for at least three 3 years and would have provided coverage of at least one hundred twentyfive 125 percent of the average annual debt service on such obligations  or if the revenue source has not been in existence for at least three 3 years be secured by a revenue source that would have provided coverage of at least one hundred twentyfive 125 percent of the average annual debt service on such obligation for at least the last full fiscal year preceding the issuance of such obligations and is projected to provide at least one hundred twentyfive 125 percent debt service coverage for each of the next two years  3  in the case of proprietary fund debt or special assessment debt be secured by a revenue source which would provide a coverage in each fiscal year of at least one hundred twentyfive 125 percent of the annual debt service in such fiscal year 4 it is anticipated forecasts that no interfund contributions from the general fund without commission approval or consent to the specific proprietary or governmental fund will be required to make up an operating short fall for purposes of calculating the coverage requirements historical and projected receipts of a particular revenue source will be adjusted retroactively to the initial date of the calculation period to reflect changes in rates or levies enacted b non selfsupporting includes all debt of the city that does not meet the definition of self supporting debt  2513  2577 debt limitations  a  selfsupporting debt for the city to issue selfsupporting governmental debt revenues as defined under the resolution authorizing the revenue bonds in question shall be a minimum of one hundred twentyfive 125 percent of the debt service for the year in which requirements are scheduled to be the greatest for proprietary debt revenues shall be a minimum of one hundred twentyfive 125 percent of the annual debt service in such fiscal year annual adjustments to the citys rate structures will be made as necessary to maintain the required coverage factors  b non selfsupporting debt the city shall conduct an objective analysis as to the communitys ability to assume and support additional debt service payments before the issuance of nonself supported debt the city shall use an analytical approach for its determination this process shall compare generally accepted standards of affordability to the current values for the city 208246 1 these standards shall include 1 debt per capita 2 debt as a percent of taxable value 3 debt service payments as a percent of current revenues and current expenditures and 4 the level of overlapping net debt of all local taxing jurisdictions 2 an examination the direct costs and benefits of the proposed expenditures 3 staff shall provide the city commission with a financial condition assessment based on financial indicators and benchmarks provided by the state of florida auditor general office auditor general staff compile the information from audit reports and other sourcesdata source  staff shall include an analysis of how any new debt would affect the citys financial condition the decision on whether or not to assume new debt shall be based on the identified costs and benefits the current conditions of the municipal bond market and the citys ability to afford new debt as determined by the aforementioned standards the city shall strive to achieve andor maintain these standards at a low to moderate classification c debt burden measures for the purposes of measuring the general government debt capacity the city includes all non selfsupporting debt under the definition of general government debt these are the programs whose expenditures for debt service are in direct competition with other general fund expenditures additionally the city considers all tax supported debt to include all non selfsupporting debt as well as the selfsupporting governmental debt this distinction recognizes that selfsupporting proprietary programs should be measured by comparing the user rates of comparable governmental providers and that such programs do not directly or indirectly place a burden on taxpayers in the form of increased taxes as long as each systems user rates meet the needs of both operations and debt service the debt program is not considered part of either the general government or tax supported debt of the city d the city commission commits to 1 act with regard to selfsupporting proprietary operations when necessary to increase rates to ensure that each operation maintains rate coverage revenue to debt service ratios as required by the higher of either city policy or related debt covenants 2 limit with regard to selfsupporting governmental revenues the level of annual debt service as a percentage of available annual revenues to ensure a reasonable ability to address recurring operations and maintenance andor capital requirements on a payasyou go basis 3 establish with regard to all non selfsupporting debt debt limits to ensure current and future flexibility  2513  2578 types of debt permitted and the criteria for issuance 209246 a short term debt current revenues andor working capital reserves are expected to cover the expenses associated with the daytoday operations of the city however shortterm obligations may be issued to finance projects or portions of projects for which the city ultimately intends to issue longterm debt short term debt shall be defined as any debt that is fully due within a twelvemonth period it can be used to provide interim financing which will be refunded with the proceeds of longterm obligations interim financing may be appropriate when longterm interest rates are expected to decline in the future in addition some forms of shortterm obligations can be obtained quicker than long term obligations and thus can be used in emergencies until longterm financing can be obtained the city will conduct an analysis of the cost differential of issuing shortterm debt to provide for immediate needs versus longterm debt to cover both immediate and future needs taking into account the carrying costs of long term financing which does not have an immediate use b long term debt the city will consider the issuance of longterm debt under the following conditions 1 one 1 time capital projects or capital improvement projects when the project is included in the citys capital improvement program and appropriated in the budget  2  an unusual equipment purchase for which it is determined to be economically beneficial for the city to purchase for unusual equipment purchases city staff shall provide the city commission with a comparison of the annual cost of renting the equipment compared to the annual debt service obligation of purchasing the equipment an estimate of the useful life expectancy of the equipment shall also be provided 3 when a project is not included in the citys capital improvement plan but it is an emerging critical need whose timing was not anticipated or it is a project mandated immediately by state or federal requirements an analysis of the projects impact on the citys capital improvement plan and future budget forecasts will be presented at the time of approval 4  to finance the acquisition or implementation of a selfsupporting proprietary or governmental programactivity c general obligation bonds when determined to be the most appropriate method of debt issuance the city will seek approval referendum to issue general obligation bonds general obligation bonds are either backed by the full faith and credit of the city with a pledge to levy the necessary ad valorem tax rate to meet the debt service requirements  or of a limited nature were the voters approve a specified millage rate to pledge d revenue debt as part of the citys financing activities specific general fund revenue sources may be identified to pledge for repayment of revenue debt recognizing the limited capacity of the citys general fund to support both ongoing operating programs and secure debt obligations use of the general fund to secure such obligations must be approved after careful review of financial forecasts key factors that will be considered in determining whether or not the general fund should be used to secure a particular debt obligation will include the following  1  demonstration of underlying selfsupport thus limiting potential general fund financial exposure 210246 2 use of general fund support as a transition to a fully stand alone credit structure where interim use of general fund credit support reduces borrowing costs and provides a credit history for new or hard to establish

issuance of revenuesecured debt obligations prior to approval of such debt the city commission will evaluate financial plans and projections showing the feasibility of the planned financing required rates and charges needed to support the planned financing and the impact of the planned financing on ratepayers property owners city revenues and other affected parties the amount of the debt obligations issued by a city will be limited by the feasibility of the overall financing plan on the proprietary activity e variable rate debt the city commission chooses not to issue securities that pay a rate of interest that varies according to predetermined formula or results from a periodic remarketing of the securities consistent with state law and covenants of preexisting bonds and depending on market conditions f leasing when found to be advantageous the city may lease equipment and facilities rather than purchase them outright leasing may be appropriate for assets that will be needed for only a short period of time or which are subject to rapid technological obsolescence leasing may also be determined to be appropriate for procuring assets that are too expensive to fund with current receipts in any one 1 year but with useful lives too short to finance with longterm debt the decision to lease will be supported by an analysis of lease vs purchase g conduit debt conduit debt are securities issued by a government agency to finance a project of a third party such as a nonprofit organization or other private entity the city may sponsor conduit debt for those activities eg economic development housing that have a general public purpose and are consistent with the citys overall service and policy objectives unless a compelling public policy rationale exists such conduit debt will not in any way pledge the citys full faith and credit h taxable debt the cost of taxable debt is higher than tax exempt debt the issuance of taxable debt is mandated in certain circumstances and may allow valuable flexibility in subsequent contracts with users or managers of the improvement constructed with the debt proceeds therefore the city may issue taxable obligations when determined to be the best method for the intended purpose i bond anticipation notes use of shortterm borrowing such as bond anticipation notes and taxexempt commercial paper will be undertaken only if the transaction costs plus interest of the debt are less than the cost of internal financing or available cash is insufficient to meet working capital requirements j interfund borrowing

used when it would reduce costs of interest debt issuance andor administration k other borrowing facilities the city may maintain or procure a special facility that will allow for borrowing on short notice either in the form of shortterm or longterm notes for small amounts not economical to finance regular bond issuance the facility can be used as an interim financing mechanism when cost effective 211246  2513  2579 structural features that may be considered debt will be structured to achieve the lowest possible net cost to the city given market conditions the urgency of the capital project and the nature and type of security provided moreover to the extent possible the city will design the repayment of its overall debt so as to recapture rapidly its credit capacity for future use in general there will be no debt structures that include increasing debt service levels in subsequent years with the exception of the first and second year there shall be no balloon bond repayment schedules that consist of low annual payments and one 1 large payment of the balance due at the end of the term there shall always be at least interest paid in the first fiscal year after the bond issue 1 backloading the city will seek to structure debt with level principal and interest costsover the life of the debt backloading of costs will only be considered in rare circumstances as follows a  when natural disasters or extraordinaryunanticipated external factors make the shortterm cost of the debt prohibitive  b when the benefits derived from the debt issuance can clearly be demonstrated to be greater in the future than in the present  c when such structuring is beneficial to the citys overall amortization schedule  or d  when such structuring will allow debt service to more closely match project revenues during the early years of the projects operation 2 call provisions the city seeks to minimize the protection from optional redemption given to bondholders consistent with its desire to obtain the lowest possible interest rate on its debt the city seeks early call options at low or no premiums to allow for refinancing of debt at greater interest savings provided there is no interest rate penalty for early call the city shall obtain advice from its financial advisor in the evaluation of optional call provisions for each issue to assure that the city does not pay unacceptably higher interest rates to obtain more advantageous call provisions 3 maturity of debt debt will be structured for the shortest period consistent with a fair allocation of costs to current and future beneficiaries or users generally debt maturity should be of a duration that does not exceed the economic life of the asset or improvement that it finances and where feasible should be shorter than the projected economic life as extended by periodic renewal and component replacement 4 credit enhancements credit enhancements are mechanisms that guarantee principal and interest payments they include bond insurance a line of credit or letter of credit a credit enhancement while costly can result in a lower interest rate on debt and a higher rating from the rating agencies thus lowering overall costs during debt issuance planning the citys financial advisor will advise whether or not a credit enhancement is cost effective under the circumstances and what type of credit enhancement if any should be purchased credit enhancements may be used but only when net debt service on the bonds is reduced by more than the costs of the enhancement 5 subordinate lien obligations

project or service will pay for it for example if a project is a general function of government that benefits the entire community the project could be funded from general tax revenues directly or service if the project benefits specific users the source of funding will be derived feescharges or targeted assessments  effectiveness in selection of financing sources for projects the city will select one 1 or more that effectively fund the total cost of the project  efficiency if grants or current revenues are not available to fund a project the city will select a financing technique that provides for the lowest total cost consistent with acceptable risk factors and principles of equity and effectiveness  c  maintenance replacement and renewal consistent with the citys philosophy of

the former  2172 pertained to crossconnectionbackflow prevention and derived from  adopted  the historical notation has been retained with the amended provisions for reference purposes  2176 introduction a cross connection is defined by the american water works association awwa as any connection or structural arrangement between the publics or a consumers potable water system and any nonpotable source or system backflow may occur backflow literally a reversal in the normal direction of flow within a water system is what turns a cross connection into a health hazard consequently either cross connection or the chance of backflow must be eliminated to prevent these unseen hazards from degrading the high quality of water that the city utilities department strives to maintain  9711  2177 purpose 2568 the purpose of this division is to protect the potable water supply of the city from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within its customers internal system or systems those contaminants or pollutants which could backflow or backsiphon into the public water supply system  to promote the elimination or control of existing cross connections actual or potential between the customers potable water system or systems and nonpotable water systems plumbing fixtures and industrial piping systems  and provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems  9711  2178 utilities department to administer program  applicability of provisions a the utilities department shall be responsible for administration of a crossconnection control and backflow prevention program that complies with rules established by the state department of environmental protection for protection of the public water supply system b the utilities department shall install and maintain a backflow preventer device in every meter box where

footprint in excess of 5100 square feet shall be computed in the manner provided herein for general parcels 3 residential condominium parcels i a residential condominium constitutes a unique form of real property ownership comprised of condominium residential unit parcels to which there may be an appurtenant undivided share in condominium common area parcels ii it is fair and reasonable to attribute the impervious area of condominium common area parcels to the condominium residential unit parcels to which such condominium common area parcels are appurtenant iii the number of net erus attributable to each condominium residential unit parcel in a residential condominium shall be equal to the sum of the following a the amount computed by multiplying 1 the amount calculated by i dividing the impervious area of the condominium complex on which the condominium residential unit parcel is located by the eru value 3652 square feet and ii dividing the result by the total number of condominium residential unit parcels located on such condominium and by 2 the appropriate mitigation credit factor 4 general parcels the number of net erus attributable to each general parcel shall be determined by 1 dividing the impervious area of the general parcel by the eru value 3652 square feet and 2 multiplying the result by the appropriate mitigation credit factor h private mitigation facilities 1 the city commission recognizes the benefits provided by privately maintained mitigation facilities properties supporting private mitigation facilities should be credited for the public benefits they provide accordingly the charges based on the number of erus otherwise attributable to such property may be adjusted by a mitigation credit determined in accordance with the citys mitigation credit policy which may be adopted by the city commission by separate resolution no mitigation credit shall exceed the amount of the tax parcels stormwater utility fee 2 in order to receive a new mitigation credit for which property is eligible a nonresidential property owner shall be required to provide the city utilities director with as built drawings of the mitigation facilities

design guidelines for residential pdps guidelines in this section are intended to assist the applicant in designing the project and the city in assessing the quality of the proposed development a  relationship to surrounding area the development is not isolated from the surrounding community but is an integral part of the community methods for achieving roadways and pedestrianbike paths connect to the surrounding roadways neighborhoods commercial areas and parks streets extend or expand the existing street pattern collector streets do not terminate within the development perimeter walls are discouraged in developments with under one hundred 100 units in gated communities perimeter walls are inconspicuous and heavily landscaped landscaping has a natural rather than formalized appearance entrances to the development are understated and do not promote the concept of a development that is separate from the surrounding community pedestrian connections to surrounding streets are provided buffers and perimeter walls b  overall design the layout of the development is suited to the configuration and characteristics of the land and integrates natural features into the overall design methods of achieving natural features of the land including wetlands ponds hills and vegetation are preserved and become the basis for the layout of the development parks and open areas incorporate natural features for the enjoyment of all residents and become focal points for the development and for neighborhoods roadways provide views of natural features and open space changes in elevation are used as a design feature to provide interest commercial areas in mixeduse developments are located for convenient and safe access from outside and inside the development by vehicles and pedestrians location of buildings on ridges is avoided so that the rooftops do not dominate the landscape c neighborhoods the development establishes identifiable neighborhoods engendering a feeling of belonging methods of achieving dwellings are clustered rather than located in linear patterns on long streets the number of dwellings in each singlefamily neighborhood does not exceed fifty 50 each neighborhood has its own common open space designed as a focal point and visible from most units central greens are encouraged housing stylestypes and streetscapes are chosen and designed to distinguish neighborhoods front porches small front yards and walkways connecting to the street provide opportunities for social interaction 143285 d streetscapes streetscapes are designed to provide interest and variety  views of the street are attractive from the dwelling units and from the point of view of the pedestrian walking along the street methods of achieving collector roads have landscaped medians or adjacent landscaped pedestrianbike corridors driveways intersecting collector roads are minimized visual interest is provided along the street landscaping and street lighting and varied street and sidewalk patterns location and orientation of houses or buildings on sites provides variety and distinctiveness to the street building facades and entrance features are varied building sizes and types

located and landscaped to provide rest stops for pedestrians and to visually punctuate the streetscape benches or retaining walls provide seating spine roads and long sections of local streets meander and are attractively landscaped long blocks are broken up with landscaped islands plantings are chosen to distinguish the street or neighborhood from others streets are oriented to provide views of open areas and vistas from hillsides intersections have landscaping and design features to add interest and shield houses on corner lots clutter along the street is minimized in dense neighborhoods by grouping mail boxes and trash collection stations keeping signage to a minimum and providing visitor parking areas see also lighting e street system a wellplanned street system establishes coherence to the development provides safe and efficient circulation for vehicles and pedestrians and defines neighborhoods methods of achieving a hierarchy of streets is established providing a coherent circulation system  a maze of local streets is avoided loop roads and branches from a spine road provide access to neighborhoods the use of culs de sac is minimized streets within neighborhoods are designed to provide unity and definition to the neighborhood streets are designed to allow for expansion of the development into nearby areas via collector roads f  pedestrian circulation a comprehensive system of sidewalks and bike paths throughout the development connects dwelling units to recreation areas parking areas public transportation stops common buildings and adjacent neighborhoods and provides a safe and attractive walking environment for recreational and practical use 144285 the pedestrianbike circulation system is planned as an integral part of the overall design of the development providing connections between dwelling units and all facilities in the development pedestrianbike paths running along streets are buffered from the travel ways of streets by landscaped strips pedestrianbike paths are designed as recreational features or to double as recreational features paths that are separate from the vehicular ways are encouraged provided they are in landscaped corridors and there are sufficient connections between dwelling units and likely destinations paths meander areas providing alternative routes for recreational walks and visual variety for the pedestrian  paths do not run unvaryingly parallel to streets paths provide views of open areas water bodies wetlands landscaped areas streets and neighborhoods g focal points and gathering places

play courts community buildings bike paths swimming pools jogging paths are examples h  landscaping landscaping in the development provides visual interest screening where needed incorporates existing mature trees and other valuable vegetation enhances natural features such as wetlands and minimizes water use methods of achieving an overall landscaping concept is prepared for the development with attention to streetscape plantings in recreation and common areas attractive landscaping around buildings and in yards retention of existing trees and appropriateness of plant selections to the environment streets lot lines and building envelopes are located to preserve existing trees particularly in parks front yards and in landscaped islands and street edges 145285 native plant types and low water use species are used extensively rear yards are buffered from roadways by landscaped buffers a proliferation of individual privacy fences along streets is avoided landscaping is provided to screen lots where a double line of lots is located so that back yards or side yards abut where side building setbacks are small plant materials are placed to screen side lot lines from the street all dumpsters and other mechanical facilities are screened attractively frameworks for plants to grow on such as trellises or arbors are provided in parks and yards existing or new largecaliper trees are used at focal points providing the immediate impact of mature trees i parking and access sufficient provision is made for resident and visitor parking and access for services such as deliveries and

or zone within this strip a permanent visual screen such as a wall or evergreen hedge with a minimum height of six 6 feet shall be provided 147285 design guidelines a  relationship to surrounding area the development is not isolated from the surrounding community but is an integral part of the community the site plan for the development is complementary to site features of surrounding development and does not create incompatible juxtapositions methods for achieving pedestrian and bike paths connect the development with surrounding residential and nonresidential land uses and with pedestrian and bike paths along roadways in the vicinity of the project cross access easements roadway connections and location of entrances facilitate vehicular access to the development from residential and nonresidential land uses in the area surrounding the project open space in the development is connected to open space and parks in adjacent development the backs of buildings loading docks outdoor storage areas and dumpsters are located away from surrounding residential and other sensitive uses and are screened with attractive landscaping andor fencing from adjacent uses and roadways distance and solid fencing reduce noise from such uses as dumpsters and loading docks the scale architectural style and location of buildings is chosen to be compatible with surrounding development and to provide transitions from large or massive buildings to surrounding land uses particularly singlefamily development b natural features of land the layout of the development is suited to the configuration and characteristics of the land and integrates natural features into the overall design methods of achieving natural features of the land including wetlands ponds hills and vegetation are preserved and become the basis for the layout of the development open areas incorporate natural features become focal points for the development site layout allows views of natural features and open space from project entrances and public spaces such as restaurants and outdoor plazas changes in site elevation are used as a design feature to provide interest c unified concept the project creates an attractive and pleasant grouping of buildings with a unique identity and sense of place for employees and clients  buildings are not lined up parallel to the roadway with a large parking lot in front methods for achieving buildings have architectural harmony and are located in functional and attractive groupings a design concept for the development including outparcels promotes functional and architectural coherence the concept addresses the relationships of buildings in terms of appearance and access by vehicles and pedestrians includes plazas for outdoor gatherings incorporates open space and natural features into the design and provides attractive landscaping throughout outparcels are situated to complement the overall design and do not visually dominate the project frontage 148285 parking areas are designed for both convenience and attractiveness large areas of asphalt are avoided off small parking areas using landscaped separation strips and site layout signage and landscaping are planned to unify buildings and uses and to promote design coherence to the whole project the development has a unifying feature or features such as a central plaza giving a sense of overall design and providing places for outdoor events and social interaction the site layout and landscaping avoids the appearance from the street of a huge unrelieved parking lot d  circulation the development is easily accessible to vehicles bicycles and pedestrians methods for achieving vehicular entrances and access roads do not direct traffic entering the site directly to the front of the building but to parking aisles the site design integrates parking among the buildings or wraps parking around two 2 or more sides of buildings rather than consolidating all parking spaces in a large parking area that is segregated from the buildings multiple pedestrian access points to a group of buildings and adjacent parking areas avoids vehicular congestion at the front of a building and competition for parking near one 1 entrance the distance from any parking space to a building entrance is minimized  optimum distance less than one hundred fifty 150 feet parking aisles are short and wide to allow safe passage of pedestrians and vehicles bicycle lanes or paths are provided from adjacent bike paths and local streets  bike racks are provided close to buildings walkways separate from vehicular ways are provided for pedestrians e landscaping and lighting an attractive and pedestrianscale atmosphere is created landscaping and pleasant unobtrusive lighting methods for

city standards for the creation of local historic districts for nominating properties to the national register of historic places and for the issuance of certificates of appropriateness for work undertaken in the locally adopted historic districts findings of fact a there are located within the city districts sites buildings structures objects and areas both public and private which are reminders of past eras events and persons important in local state or national history or which provide significant examples of architectural styles of the past or which are unique and irreplaceable assets to the city and its neighborhoods or which provide for this and future generations examples of the physical surroundings in which past generations lived b in recognition of these assets the historic preservation element of the comprehensive plan was enacted and includes a policy to consider a historic preservation ordinance c a study entitled historic properties survey of lake wales florida was completed by historic property associates inc of st augustine florida in 1988 to catalogue historical buildings in the downtown business district and in those areas that were closely tied historically or stylistically with the downtown d through the dedicated efforts of local groups and individuals the value of a district and several sites buildings structures objects and areas both public and private have been recognized by their inclusion in the national register of historic places the state inventory maintained by the division of archives e  the recognition protection enhancement and use of such resources has a public purpose being essential to the health safety morals and economic educational cultural and general welfare of the public since these efforts result in the enhancement of property values the stabilization of neighborhoods and areas of the city the increase of economic benefits to the city and its inhabitants the promotion of local interest the enrichment of human life in its educational and cultural dimensions serving spiritual as well as material needs and the fostering of civic pride in the beauty and noble accomplishments of the past f it is the policy of the city to encourage beautification and general improvement of and cleanliness within the city by requiring the installation of appropriate landscaping which will enhance the communitys ecological environmental and aesthetic qualities and which will preserve the value of the property 204285 g the city commission desires to take advantage of all available state and federal laws and programs that may assist in the development of the city  52008  23652 criteria for historic designations criteria in this section shall be used to review national register nominations and for

this division establishes a concurrency management system to evaluate development applications to ensure that adequate capacity in required public facilities is or will be available to serve the proposed development at the time it is required in accordance with fs   public facilities subject to the concurrency management system are sanitary sewer potable water solid waste roads public schools recreation and open space and drainage the demand on a public facility is calculated use of the level of service los standard for that facility or service adopted by the city in the lake wales comprehensive plan and set forth in table 23705 b it is the intent of the city commission that no development permits or orders may be issued that will cause a public facility or service to operate below the adopted level of service standard development orders may however be conditioned such that public facility improvements or capacity will be in place concurrent or at the time the facility or service is needed by the proposed development consistent with florida law public facilities to serve the new development shall be in place no later than the issuance by the city of a certificate of occupancy co or its functional equivalent c the concurrency management system is intended to serve the long term interests of the citizens of lake wales by implementing a managed growth perspective that monitors the capacity of important public facilities and services in order to prevent the degradation of adopted levels of service the system does not however serve as a guarantee to any person or property owner that a particular level of service or amount of capacity currently exists or will exist in the future on a particular public facility at any given point in time d the following definitions apply to concurrency management rules and regulations building permit for purposes of the concurrency management system a permit may authorize the construction of a new building expansion of floor area or an increase in the number of dwelling units contained in an existing building or a change in use capacity the availability of a public service or facility to accommodate users expressed in an appropriate unit of measure such as gallons per day or average daily trips capacity available capacity that can be reserved or committed to future users for a specific public facility capacity committed the amount of capacity that has been committed to accommodate existing developments developments which have been issued a final development approval committed development and vested developments capacity reserved capacity that has been removed from the available capacity pool and allocated to a particular property for a set period of time certificate of occupancy a document issued by the building official allowing the occupancy or use of a building and certifying that the structure or use has been constructed or will be used in compliance with all the applicable municipal codes and ordinances concurrency facilities public facilities and services for which a level of service must be met concurrent with the impacts of development or an acceptable deadline as mandated in the city of lake wales comprehensive plan pursuant to fs ch 163  shall include sanitary sewer potable water solid waste roads public schools recreation & open space and drainage concurrency management monitoring system the data collection processing and analysis performed by city staff to determine available capacity for concurrency facilities data utilized shall be the most current reliable information available to the city 208285 concurrency management system cms the procedure and process that the city uses to ensure that no development order or building permit is issued by the city unless the necessary concurrency facilities are available or are assured to be available consistent with the citys comprehensive plan the procedure and process is also intended to ensure that sufficient capacity for concurrency facilities are available to meet and maintain adopted levels of service as part of the cms the city shall operate and maintain a concurrency management monitoring system concurrency review an evaluation by the planning and development director and staff based on adopted level of service standards to ensure that public facilities and services needed to support development are available concurrent with the impacts of such development as defined in this cms if such facilities are not available the developer of a proposed development shall bear the cost of providing public services and facilities at the level of service defined by the comprehensive plan and concurrent with the impacts of a proposed development concurrency status report a status report prepared by the city identifying available concurrency facility capacity the status report shall be produced modified and adjusted from timetotime as a result of the reservation of capacity or other act that alters the availability of concurrency facility capacity design capacity the potential or suitability for holding storing or accommodating the demands upon a concurrency facility development agreement an agreement between the city and another party associated with the development of land or the provision of public infrastructure which may include development agreements defined pursuant to fs   or as may be associated with development orders issued pursuant to fs  38001 level of service los an indicator of the operational efficiency of service provided by a concurrency facility level of service standard the adopted volume of demand required for each concurrency facility to achieve acceptable operational efficiency vested development shall be deemed vested and not subject to requirements of concurrency management if development circumstances meet criteria for common law or statutory vesting as defined below all nonvested development or development orders are subject to all requirements of this cms vested rights common law a right not created by statute or the provisions of the city of lake wales comprehensive plan which would authorize the development of real property or the continued development of real property notwithstanding the provisions of the citys comprehensive plan the city may find such vesting to exist whenever the applicant proves by a preponderance of evidence that the real property owner acting in good faith upon some act or omission of the city has made a substantial change in the position or has incurred such extensive obligations and expenses that it would be highly inequitable and unjust to destroy the right to develop or to continue the development of the real property the assignment of the particular zoning classification or the assignment of a particular land use designation to parcel of real property does not guarantee or vest any specific development rights to any person or entity as to said real property 209285  7505   21908   011916 vested rights statutory a statutory right to develop or to continue the development of real property pursuant to the provisions of fs  8 or its successor

development is in the process of being completed or further development is continuing in good faith statutory vesting does not occur unless all material requirements conditions limitations and regulations of the development approval have been met and are being maintained  23702 components of concurrency management system a the concurrency management system cms has three 3 components 1 inventory of public facilities and capacities city staff must maintain an inventory of existing public facilities for which level of service los standards have been adopted and for which concurrency is to be determined the inventory includes the existing condition and total capacity for each facility the reservations of capacity that have been granted for proposed development and an estimate of when the capacity will be utilized as development progresses and the remaining available capacity in the facility 2 concurrency review of proposed developments each development application must be reviewed to determine if adequate capacity is or will be available to serve the proposed development 3 schedule of improvements to public facilities a program must be conducted by the city to implement improvements to public facilities to correct deficiencies or expand capacity to adequately serve existing and new development the program will include capital projects in the citys capital facilities budget and improvements required of new development  b  the city manager will provide an annual concurrency status report to the city commission the initial report will be presented no later than the second regularly scheduled meeting in june and subsequent reports will be presented at the second meeting in january the report will include in the reserved and committed capacity inventory as applicable all developments for which permits and approvals were issued prior to  provided they meet the vesting requirements for reservations of capacity or certificates of concurrency  752005  23703 inventory of public facilities and concurrency status report the annual concurrency status report to the city commission on the inventory of public facilities must include a the status

fairshare program a purpose and intent the purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors to be known as the proportionate fairshare program as required by and in a manner consistent with fs  16 b findings 1 the commission finds and determines that transportation capacity is a commodity that has a value to both the public and private sectors and the city proportionate fairshare program a provides a method by which the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors  b allows developers to proceed under certain conditions notwithstanding the failure of transportation concurrency by contributing their proportionate fairshare of the cost of the transportation facility  c  contributes to the provision of adequate public facilities for future growth and promotes a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning thereby reducing the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of traffic congestion  d  maximizes the use of public funds for adequate transportation facilities to serve future growth and may in certain circumstances allow the city to expedite transportation improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for transportation improvements in the capital improvements element cie e is consistent with fs  16 and supports the concurrency management system cms in the city comprehensive plan policies 201 and 202

using proportionate fairshare under fs  12 or to developments exempted from concurrency as provided in article vii div 1 subsection 7044a4 lwc the proportionate fairshare program does not preclude applicants from funding transportation improvements pursuant to a development agreement to meet concurrency requirements if the project traffic for a proposed development will impact or create a deficient roadway segment or intersection that is maintained by another jurisdiction then the permitting jurisdiction will coordinate with the maintaining jurisdiction regarding the need or applicability for proportionate fairshare mitigation of project traffic d general requirements 1 an applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirement of the city by making a

mitigate the impacts of development  1252006 division 2 development agreements  23731 utility capacity queue agreement  findings purpose and intent the city commission has determined that during times of increased demand for and rapid utilization of remaining water wastewater and reclaimed water capacity additional capacity should not be sold without ensuring that the existing facilities are not oversold leaving the city unable to meet the capacity demands sold the city commission is committed to developing new facilities but is unable to do so without firm commitments for the new capacity and orderly reservation of capacity for developers given the uncertainty of developer commitments the city commission finds that capacity reservations must be irrevocable after the developer has contracted for services but will allow transfer of capacity without a profit the city commission finds that it is in the interests of city citizens and the developers interested in developing within the city to develop a queue for all new requests for additional treatment plant capacity  capacity reservations determine queue a  all capacity reserved paid in advance  queue position established all future requests for contracts for water wastewater and reclaimed water service by developers owning or controlling property within the city shall require the developer to make deposit payment based on ten 10 percent of the present capacity fees for the capacity necessary for that property and be placed in the citys utility capacity queue prior to any reservation of capacity in existing or future

utility services agreement can be negotiated between the parties no capacity shall be promised to the developer under the capacity queue agreement in exchange for the partial capacity fee payment but only a position in the queue to facilitate future agreements for reservation of capacity as well as the planning design or construction of new capacity if necessary once the queue agreement is executed and the partial capacity fee is delivered with the agreement to the city the city shall clock in the agreement and capacity fee to establish the developers position in the queue the citys signature is not required for the queue position the development shall remain in the capacity queue until such time as the city executes a utility services agreement with the developer to reserve the utility treatment plant capacity 2  the city shall establish a utility capacity queue based on date of approval for all developments or development phases for which a preliminary site plan preliminary subdivision plat or preliminary planned development plan was approved prior to  but for which a site development permit has not been granted the capacity queued for the development shall be that which was approved with the development with the preliminary plan or plat and a deposit of capacity fees shall not be required b  capacity queue position converted to reservation of capacity once the utility facilities for which the developers are queued are identified or completed by the city or the city manager determines that the facilities shall be completed before the capacity is needed by the developers developers in the queue may be offered utility services agreements for their capacity needs depending on the availability of capacity c  abandonment of capacity by failure to execute utility services agreement in the event that a developer chooses not to execute a utility services agreement or is unable to resolve contractual issues with the city in the citys utility services agreement within thirty 30 days of being provided a draft of said agreement the developer shall have abandoned its capacity reservation offer the city manager may extend the termination date hereunder for no more than one 1 additional fifteenday period without commission approval if the city manager in his or her sole discretion determines that the developer is negotiating in good faith but has still been reasonably unable to resolve its issues with the draft utility services agreement those developments for which a utility services agreement has not been executed within the required time period shall remain in the queue with their positions based upon their queue agreement dates those developments that do not have a queue agreement and are in the queue based upon a plan approval see section 237312a2 shall be removed from the queue upon notification by a developer to remove a development from the queue the city shall refund the partial utility capacity fees made with the queue agreement less any city costs d capacity queue position may be transferred but not for a profit the developers position in a capacity queue can be transferred only as part of a sale of the land for which the capacity is sought  however such capacity cannot be sold or transferred for more than the amount paid by the developer e ties for capacity queue take same place in the event that more than one developer executed and paid for their requested capacity within twentyfour 24 hours of another developer the queue position shall be deemed a tie and both or all shall be given the same place in the queue bond placement shall not be considered for the tie 225285 f  exceptions the following are exceptions to the requirement that all developments requesting new capacity shall first enter into a

association shall be reviewed and approved by the city attorney prior to issuance of the final development order b  no such organization shall be dissolved nor shall it dispose of any common land private streets or facilities by sale or otherwise except to an organization conceived and organized to own and maintain such property the organization may offer to dedicate all such land streets and facilities to the city the city may make acceptance subject to improvements which shall be made before the land streets or facilities are transferred if the city agrees to accept the land streets or facilities the organization may be disbanded but not before the improvements are made and the property is transferred division 4 public facilities impact fees  23761 definitions when used in this

3408  23762 legislative findings and intent a both existing development and development resulting from growth as contemplated by the comprehensive plan will require improvements and additions to public facilities to accommodate and maintain the level of service adopted by the city b future growth represented by public facilities impact construction should contribute its fair share to the cost of improvements and additions to public facilities that are required to accommodate the use of such facilities by growth c the required improvements and additions to the public facilities needed to accommodate existing development at the adopted level of service shall be financed by revenue sources other than impact fees d  implementation of an impact fee structure to require future public facilities impact construction to contribute its fair share of the cost of improvements and additions to public facilities is an integral and vital element of the management of growth e public facilities planning is an evolving process and the level of service adopted by the city for such public facilities constitutes a balancing of anticipated need and the corresponding cost to implement such standard based upon present knowledge and judgment therefore in recognition of changing growth patterns the needs of the community and the dynamics of public facilities planning it is the intent of the commission that the level of service and the cost of the various public facilities be reviewed and adjusted periodically pursuant to section 23779 to insure that the impact fees imposed pursuant to this division are equitable and lawful based on the impact of growth upon these public facilities f this ordinance shall not be construed to permit the collection of impact fees from public facilities impact construction in excess of the amount reasonably anticipated to offset the need for and demand on those public facilities generated by such impact construction g this division is intended to be consistent with the principles for allocating a fair share of the cost of new public facilities to new users as established by the florida supreme court in the case of contractor and builders association of pinellas county vs city of dunedin 329 so 2nd 314 fl 1976 and to meet the requirements of the florida impact fee act fs ch  particularly the requirement that impact fees are to
