such as that moving between a subdivision and a major street the principle difference between the collector street and the major street is the length of trip which each principally serves they are intended to supply the abutting property with the same degree of land service as the local street while at the same time serving larger volumes of traffic local streets the sole function of these streets is to provide access to the immediately adjacent property local access streets generally carry low volumes of traffic subdivider any person responsibly engaged in developing or improving a

ordinance is to reduce the hazard to public health and safety caused by excessive storm water runoff to enhance economic objectives and to protect conserve and promote the orderly development of land and water resources within the regulatory area this ordinance regulates a storm water drainage improvements related to development of lands located within the corporate limits of the city and all areas within one and onehalf 1 2 miles of the corporate limits as existing now or in the future b drainage control systems installed during new construction and grading of lots and other parcels of land c erosion and sediment control systems installed during new construction of grading of lots and other parcels of land d the design construction and maintenance of storm water drainage facilities and systems e existing storm water drainage systems where the inclusion of improvements is feasible it is recognized that drainage systems serving the city of mt vernon and adjacent areas may not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey storm water runoff resulting when land changes from open or agricultural use to a more urbanized use it is further recognized that deposit of sediment from developments during and after construction can reduce capacities of storm sewers and drainage systems and result in damages to receiving lakes and streams therefore it shall be the policy of the city council that the storage and controlled release of storm water runoff shall be required of all new development any redevelopment and other new construction in the regulated areas as stipulated elsewhere in this release rate of storm water from developed lands shall not exceed the release rate from the land area in its undeveloped state because topography and the availability and adequacy of outlets for storm runoff vary with almost every site the requirements for storm drainage tend to be an individual matter for any project it is recommended that each proposed project be discussed with the city engineer s office at the earliest practical time in the planning stage 202 conflicting ordinances the provisions of this ordinance shall be deemed as additional requirements to minimum standards required by other ordinances of the city in the case of conflicting requirements the most restrictive shall apply 203 compliance with other ordinances in addition to the requirements of this

regulations the column headings in the following schedule of district regulations are selfexplanatory however prior to any reference to the schedule refer to the following general statement of intent which is to be used as a guide in any interpretation of the various statements of intent and regulations for land use districts established by this e n e r a l s t a t e m e n t o f i n t e n t the zoning districts hereby established are to effect a plan of land use which will 1 create order out of chaos 2 be based upon existing land use 3 provide a pleasant and economical living environment for inhabitants of the community establishment of a variety of districts to meet individual preferences and overall community needs 4 utilize governmental and public utilities facilities in the most economical manner possible which in turn should provide the most service for the least cost 5 preserve and enhance property values throughout the community by keeping like and compatible uses together and to separate incompatible uses from each other by designation on the zoning district map which is an integral part of this values are highest in the central business district area cbd and diminish as the distance from the cbo increases therefore it is the purpose and intent of this conserve protect enhance and utilize to the fullest extent possible these land values which the community has created consequently in establishing these districts the general objectives are to 1 utilize the existing cbd as the starting point and allowing within the cbd only appropriate uses 2 land adjacent to the cbd should permit high density more people per acre residential uses and 3 land further out to be utilized for lower density residential purposes existing ownership of land is generally in relatively small lot sizes and which often will be nonconforming to this ordinance to implement the general intent of this ordinance it is hoped that consolidation of these smaller parcels will be achieved either acquisition or some type of privately owned but unified control and that planned developments will be the rule rather than the exception especially in nonresidential areas portions of the existing thoroughfare network are the logical place for certain types of commercial uses but should only be permitted in certain compact spots not only for their own welfare but for the welfare of the entire community and its inhabitants land for industrial purposes should be provided but location should be determined by 1 existing industrial uses 2 relationships to the other land uses districts and 3 supporting transportation facilities in the thoroughfare system of the community the intent for the remaining variety of land uses are stated in the individual statement of intent for each district perpetuation of nonconformities to the various land use districts will be discouraged in the administration and interpretation of this ordinance it is further intended that in the territorial limits outside the city limits the general agriculture district be utilized as far as is practical until residential commercial or industrial development is proposed as the case may be it is also intended that any development proposed in the territorial limits outside the city limits be considered in conjunction with annexation agreements t h e c o m p r e h e n s i v e p l a n the
