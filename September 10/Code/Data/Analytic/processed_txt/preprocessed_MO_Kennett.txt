analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent 1% chance of occurrence in any one 1 year as delineated on the federal
