incorporated in the cases of city of renton v playtime theaters inc 475 us 41 1986 young v american mini theaters 426 us 50 1976 and northend cinema inc v seattle 585 p 2d 1153 wash 1978 and on studies in other communities including but not limited to phoenix az minneapolis mn saint paul mn manatee county fl houston tx indianapolis in amarillo tx los angeles ca austin tx seattle wa oklahoma city ok beaumont tx and new york ny  and also on findings found in the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota  54  1 the concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of the borough of blakely that demands reasonable regulation of adult businesses and adult uses in order to protect the health and wellbeing of its citizens 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses regulated by this adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidents of certain types of sexually oriented behavior at these businesses than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those that provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows as regulated by this adult book stores adult novelty shops adult video stores adult motion picture theaters or adult arcades 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which create unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 at least fifty 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infections aids genital herpes hepatitis b nonb amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections  and the incidence of many of these diseases is on the increase 7 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 8 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adultoriented films 9 classifying adult businesses as special exceptions is a reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult businesses comply with reasonable regulations and conditions and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation 10 there is convincing documented evidence that adult businesses because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them causing increased crime the downgrading of property values and the decline of the overall character of the community a number of municipal studies including the 1986 austin texas study have demonstrated this 11 it is generally recognized that adult businesses due to their nature have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other thereby contributing to neighborhood blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent area a number of municipal studies including the 1986 austin tx study have demonstrated this 12 the borough of blakely desires to minimize and control these adverse secondary effects and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of the citizenry protect the citizens from increased crime preserve the quality of life preserve property values and the character of the surrounding community  55  b intent the intent of this 703b is to 1 regulate adult businesses in order to promote the public health safety and welfare by minimizing the secondary effects on the community that are associated with such
