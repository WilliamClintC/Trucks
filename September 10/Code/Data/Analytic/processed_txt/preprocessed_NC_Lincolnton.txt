acceptance will result if a joint agency is responsible for issuing all of the bonds required for a project or projects in a timely and orderly manner and with a uniform credit rating than individual multiple municipalities issuing separate issues of bonds  3it is probable that savings and other advantages may be obtained by municipalities joint operating agencies responsible for the investigation

property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards prior    passed 7122007  15203 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to arestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve those uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  dcontrol filling grading dredging and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage  and eprevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands prior    passed 7122007  15204 objectives the objectives of this chapter are ato protect human life safety and health  bto minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  cto minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  dto minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions  eto minimize damage to public facilities and utilities ie water and gas mains electric telephone cable and sewer lines streets and bridges that are located in flood prone areas  fto help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas  and gto ensure that

this chapter the following districts based on the concepts and proposals of the citys land use plan and other plans and policies are hereby established in addition to the primary uses that are permitted by right or issuance of a conditional use permit other uses including accessory uses offstreet parking and signs are permitted as listed in this chapter bthe districts are divided into three different categories 1general zoning districts  2overlay districts  and 3parallel conditional use districts prior udo  61   general zoning districts general zoning districts are designated throughout the zoning jurisdiction and include numerous uses that are allowed by right subject to those uses meeting yard and height regulations in addition each zone allows for conditional uses that may be developed once a conditional use permit has been issued by the city council the following general zoning districts are hereby established ar25 rural residential district this district is intended to accommodate very low density residential and agricultural uses in fringe areas of the zoning jurisdiction that generally are nonintensely developed this district is established to accommodate very lowdensity development where public utilities are nonexistent or partially existent and to accommodate greater densities where services are present therefore density levels are variable to the existence of the facilities the continuance of agricultural operations is encouraged within this district under certain circumstances certain conditional uses may be allowed depending upon facilities to support the uses compatibility with existing and proposed surrounding development and other criteria set forth in this chapter br15 singlefamily residential district this district is established to provide areas consisting primarily of singlefamily residences located in both urban and suburban settings generally public water and sewer are available or are readily available permitted residential uses consist solely of singlefamily residences and the minimum lot size shall be 15000 square feet in addition to singlefamily residences a limited number of private and public community uses are allowed on either a permitted by right basis or on a conditional use basis where certain criteria specified in this chapter are met cr10 residential district this district is established to provide primarily for singlefamily residences the minimum lot size for singlefamily dwellings on a use by right basis is established at 10000 square feet these areas are served by water and sewer certain pubic and private community facilities are also allowed or may be allowed on a conditional basis certain cluster type residential developments may be allowed on a conditional basis whereby gross densities within the developments are generally similar to those which would be achieved square foot lots dr8 residential district 1this district is established to accommodate singlefamily dwellings on 8000 minimum square foot lots and twofamily dwellings on 12000 minimum square foot lots and to allow under certain conditions and after review and approval by the city council a variety of residential dwelling unit arrangements in planned residential developments review by the planning board and review and approval by the city council for residential uses and arrangements other than those specifically permitted by right is established to ensure that developments are wellplanned and where applicable compatible with adjoining singlefamily residences and neighborhoods these districts are located where water and sewer are present the district accommodates both one and twofamily residences 2a limited number of private and public community uses are allowed or may be allowed on a conditional use basis where certain criteria specified in this chapter are met ermf residential multifamily district this district is intended primarily as a residential district for the location of detached singlefamily dwellings twofamily dwellings and multifamily dwellings along with their customary accessory uses so as to establish areas where development patterns are somewhat more dense than surrounding areas in order to ensure that developments are well planned and compatible with adjoining residential areas multifamily projects with a density greater than six units per acre shall be a conditional use subject to review procedures set forth in   this chapter under the same intent and criteria set forth for the r8 district a variety of residential dwelling units arrangements in planned residential developments may be allowed on a conditional basis a limited number of private and public community uses are allowed or may be allowed on a conditional use basis whereby certain criteria specified in this chapter are met fro residential office district this district allows for one two and multifamily residential uses and certain commercial office and institutional uses which would create an area convenient for both residential and employment purposes in certain areas this district is also established to provide a transition between purely residential areas and primarily commercial areas in order to enhance the districts residential character the ro district for purposes of this chapter is deemed a residential district this classification does require screening and buffering from all new uses in adjacent commercial and industrial districts small offices certain community facilities and one and twofamily residences are permitted by right larger offices multifamily dwellings other community facilities and certain businesses are allowed only on a conditional use basis planned residential developments are a conditional use allowed on the same basis as in the r8 district goi office institutional district this district is established to allow for a wide variety of offices certain commercial uses having minor impacts certain community facilities professional and medical service and certain institutions singlefamily residences are permitted but unlike the ro zone the emphasis of this zone is on nonresidential uses this zone may also be established in certain areas to provide an orderly transition between residential areas and more intensive commercial uses hnb neighborhood business district 1this district is designed primarily for local business centers for retailing of merchandise such as groceries drugs and household items and for furnishing certain personal business and professional services unlike some of the other commercial zones this district is established to serve local neighborhoods and other relatively small trading areas the standards established for these business areas are designed to promote sound permanent business development and also to protect abutting or surrounding residential areas from undesirable aspects of nearby business developments these districts are located at accessible places with respect to traffic circulation in order to conveniently serve the trading population and to promote the grouping of several places of business at locations so designated since this district is established to provide for small neighborhood oriented businesses limitations on gross floor areas are established for certain uses a neighborhood business district is typically a relatively small area but shall consist of at least two lots in separate ownership or at least two acres regardless of ownership 2unlike the cb district offstreet parking landscaping and yard requirements are established for the nb district icb central business district the purpose of this district is to permit concentrated development of a wide variety of retail establishments personal services and professional and nonprofessional offices in addition certain industrial and residential uses may be developed with city council approval in light of the concentrated amount of a development normally found in a downtown area yard regulations are minimal given the lack of space for offstreet parking this requirement has also been eliminated jcbt central business transitional district the purpose of this district is to permit concentrated development of a wide variety of retail establishments personal services and professional and nonprofessional offices in addition certain industrial and residential uses may be developed with city council approval like the central business district yard regulations are minimal however unlike the central business district offstreet parking standards must be met for all uses permitted in the district the number of offstreet parking spaces required for uses in the central business transitional district is less than that for other business and commercial districts since land size limitations restrict parking area availability land in this district exhibits some of the same characteristics as land within the central business district but is generally not developed in the same concentrations as the central business district kgb general business the purpose of this district is to provide an array of retail wholesale and service uses to serve the entire community and with access to the uses being primarily by automobile the districts are located along major arterial and collector streets and adjacent to the central business district in order to have a minimal effect on residential neighborhoods lpb planned business the purpose of this district is to promote orderly and aesthetic commercial development along major highways and entranceways in the lincolnton area in order to achieve this goal the conditional use process will be employed here for larger tracts of property and for largersized building in this manner the city council will be able to review plans for most new developments in these districts and be able to ensure that provisions such as adequate ingress and egress buffering landscaping screening traffic flow and the like are properly addressed mgmc general manufacturing and commercial this district is designed primarily for general commercial and industrial land uses including manufacturing processing and assembling of parts and products  distribution of products at wholesale outlets retail outlets  transportation terminals  various public and utility uses  and a broad variety of specialized commercial and industrial operations many types of the operations are permitted by right certain types of manufacturing and commercial operations however will be allowed only upon issuance of a conditional use permit the permits are issued only after review by the planning board and city council and the city council having made certain findings and determined any required conditions as set forth in   nros residential office singlefamily this district is established to accommodate both singlefamily residential uses and other light office and institutional uses in older areas of the city that have developed in a manner that includes those uses it is important that areas zoned ros exist in harmony with adjacent established singlefamily areas unlike the ro district the ros district does not allow for the conditional use of multifamily or planned residential developments like the ro district however the ros district is a residential district this classification requires screening and buffering from all new uses in adjacent commercial and industrial districts prior udo  62 penalty see     overlay districts overlay districts are established to provide for certain additional requirements andor uses for properties located in one or more general zoning districts thus in addition to the requirements of the underlying general zoning district the provisions of the overlay district andor any subsequent rezonings may be initiated by an individual planning board or city council a zoning map change either establishing or changing any overlay district shall be subject to the same procedures and requirements as any other zoning map change amho manufactured home overlay the purpose of this district is to provide areas in which class a manufactured homes can be located on individual lots in order that these homes when placed on the lot are compatible with singlefamily residences the mh district does provide certain size construction and aesthetic standards for manufactured homes by allowing only class a manufactured homes as defined in   the mh overlay district supplements the range of uses permitted in the underlying district all other uses and regulations for the underlying district shall continue to remain in effect for properties classified in the mh overlay district the mh overlay district may only be located in areas that contain a residential r underlying general zoning district the overlay areas may not consist of an individual lot or scattered lots but shall consist of a defined area within which additional requirements or standards are placed upon manufactured homes the intent of this approach is to allow manufactured homes in parts of a zoning district where they would not otherwise be allowed subject to appropriate conditions in determining these areas the city council will give close consideration to whether manufactured homes would be compatible with surrounding land uses bsh special highway overlay district the purpose of this district is to protect and preserve the natural scenic beauty of the landscape of areas which lie near or adjacent to designated special highways and that development which takes place on land which lies near the highways be developed in a manner which maximizes the attractiveness of uses and the safety and order of development of the area application of additional development standards ensuring that development occurs in a manner it will in turn contribute to and enhance trade tourism capital investment public safety and the general welfare cho historic overlay district this shall be an additional zone established pursuant to gs which may overlay other zoning districts on the official zoning map that portion of any zoning district to which the ho district shall apply shall also be delineated on the official zoning map the ho district is intended as an area in which conservation preservation restoration and development of historic character and significance and be fostered and

the city council within 30 calendar days after a written request for the analysis has been received by the department of cultural resources shall relieve the city of any responsibility for awaiting the analysis and the city council may at any time thereafter take any necessary action to adopt or amend the zoning regulations prior udo  63 penalty see     cu parallel conditional use districts aparallel conditional use districts are established to consider situations where a particular use may be acceptable on a lot or tract of land but the other uses permitted in a general zoning district would not be acceptable in these instances the city council may elect to rezone the lots in question to a parallel conditional use district the rezonings may be made contingent upon the property owner

section is to set forth guiding principles for traditional neighborhood development design and to allow relief to some of the prdpud standards in   and  when the developments are found to substantially meet the guiding principles of this section bguiding principles for organizational purposes the guiding principles have been divided into six categories  however most principles relate to multiple categories a tnd must substantially meet each of these principles where the development application does not meet a particular principle the applicant shall submit written justification substantiating why that principle cannot be met unless the principle is described as optional the guiding principles are as follows 1public realm principles athe central element of traditional neighborhood design is the emphasis and weight given to the public realm the streets and plazas and the public open spaces such as parks playgrounds greens and natural areas together with semipublic spaces which frame the public realm and provide transition between public and entirely private spaces btnds feature welldesigned public spaces special emphasis on public and cultural buildings and special design treatment for vista terminations ca sense of enclosure is maintained along the public street appropriate ratio between the height of building fronts and the distance between buildings on opposite sides of the street where the street frontage consists of single story buildings or open space street trees can be a substitute for front building walls to maintain this sense of enclosure

onethird the lot width encroachments are allowed for porches steps bay windows and balconies ethe public realm shall be appropriately landscaped unless good landscape design would otherwise dictate each street shall be provided with an orderly regimen of street trees of substantial nursery stock which will grow quickly to provide a street canopy planting strips wide enough to accommodate street trees typically separate sidewalks from street roadways see division b2f below fsinglefamily home lots in tnds are typically smaller and narrower than in conventional subdivisions a substantial amount of land area savings from reduced lot sizes is dedicated toward common areas g1narrower lots necessitate alternative treatment of certain fixtures that can diminish the aesthetic quality of the public realm a system of rear access lanes alleys can provide garage access at the rear of the lot this is especially preferred for lots less than 50 feet in width when built to a 16foot standard with a 24foot rightofway the alley can also serve as an appropriate location for electric gas cable television and telephone equipment as well as access for garbage pickup and mail delivery on lots at least 50 feet wide alternate less preferred methods of garage access include in descending order of preference aa front driveway accessing a garage behind the house or near the back of the lot  bturning the garage so that it does not face the front provided the garage is flush with or set behind the front building line  csetting the garage at least 20 feet behind the front of the house  or dproviding special architectural treatment to the house to visually deemphasize a garage at the front 2where alleys are not available other measures shall be taken to hide utility equipment  however fire hydrants are always located on the fronting street ideally situated on planting strip bulbouts at intersections htnds are designed so that there are linkages between the private realm and the public realm while protecting private spaces singlefamily detached homes typically have front porches large enough for sitting with a six to eightfoot minimum depth and attached dwellings typically have

termination to provide a sense of place arrival jutility wiring shall be underground and decorative street lighting fixtures are encouraged but not mandated 2transportation system principles atnds always have a connecting web of streets typically provided by a grid or modified grid street pattern the street system is organized in a comprehensible network hierarchy that forms an orderly discernable neighborhood structure bculdesacs shall be avoided unless natural site or site boundary conditions require them in those situations special street design features such as street eyebrows and culdesac loops are encouraged instead of standard ballend culdesacs ccurved as well as straight streets are allowed  however each must contribute to the connecting web where possible curved streets maintain the same cardinal orientation long blocks shall be avoided with the average block length in a tnd being no greater than 600 feet  the average block perimeter shall be 1800 feet dwhile the sense of enclosure described in division b1c above will help to reduce traffic speeds additional design measures will be needed to slow traffic examples of the measures include the features as bulbing out the curb line at intersections traffic circles or roundabouts streets no wider than necessary to provide adequate access design for and encouragement of onstreet parking and safe but unconventional street geometrics the internal streets shall be designed to feel safe driving at a speed no more than 25 mph note street requirements of   of this title are waived in tnds e1backtoback

intersections and at midblock cross walks curve radii at intersections shall be ten to 20 feet depending on street function standard vertical curb is preferred and it is required on all residential streets without driveways auto access is provided via a rear alley and all commercial streets note oneway streets although allowed are strongly discouraged ftnds shall always be designed to be walkable and pedestrianfriendly communities in the fullest sense they shall contain sidewalks on both sides of the street and in addition may contain a network of offroad walking and bike trails sidewalks are well separated from the roadway with planting strips that are planted with indigenous mostly deciduous shade trees on commercial streets sidewalks may extend to the curb with street trees planted in grates or other sufficiently sized planting space planting strips shall be a minimum of six feet in width but may be reduced to no less than four feet in width in situations that are both unusual and difficult sidewalks shall be a minimum of four feet in width on residential streets with wider widths on commercial streets gtnds always have multiple points of ingress and egress from collector and arterial roads the street system shall also flow seamlessly to adjoining neighborhoods both existing or planned in the future htnds are never gated communities ioffstreet parking lots should generally not front along a public street onstreet parking shall be provided throughout the development and particularly so on streets with commercial buildings andor attached housing where additional parking is needed it is usually provided behind buildings in the interior of the block the calculation of parking needs for nonresidential uses will always take into consideration available onstreet parking parking lots shall include shade trees and no space in a parking lot shall be further than 60 feet from the trunk of a large tree each large tree shall be planted in a planting area sized and shaped to enable healthy growth pedestrian access from interior block parking area is best provided via a midblock passageway to the street front this passageway can also be

sale 3mixed use principles atnds shall contain a significant mixture of principal uses both residential and nonresidential btnds shall also contain a mixture of residential types ctnds should be designed to offer housing at a variety of affordability levels allowing garage apartments and granny flats at the rear of single home lots in accordance with the developments private guidelines whether rented or not is encouraged these innovative but historically traditional housing forms help to accommodate family situations and promote income diversity within the tnd dlivework units shop or office at the street level and residence at the second level and upperstory apartments over groundfloor businesses are encouraged ein tnds denser housing and livework units are typically located closer to the neighborhood center with a transition outward to less dense housing such as detached singlefamily homes this principle should not be construed to discourage the careful blending of housing types as this transition occurs fschools and churches are encouraged to locate within a tnd as is the provision of pedestrian and bicycle routes to connect to the facilities inside or outside the tnd gwhere buildings are on both sides of the street similar building types should face each other to the greatest degree possible singlefamily detached houses townhouses livework units apartment buildings and store buildings are examples of building types htnds are expected to provide some onsite andor adjacent to site employment opportunities this can include employment in the services and stores within the tnd livework units the owner dwelling over his or her shop or office or larger employment centers such as office buildings 4architectural principles athe architectural style within a tnd shall respond to the surrounding fabric of buildings and spaces and to local traditions the principle that structures should be seamlessly linked to their surroundings within the tnd transcends

drive ca public gathering space such as a plaza green or square is usually present along with one or more focal features in or near this public space such as a clock tower fountain monument bandstand andor public art which serve to terminate vistas and define the community dthe tnd neighborhood center is ideally located near the geographic center of the development  however it may also identify itself jointly with a thoroughfare bordering the tnd and therefore be located near this major road or be linked to this road with an entrance street in order that businesses within the center may more easily attract patrons from outside the development this can serve to improve chances for economic success of the tnd center ideally the neighborhood center is no farther than onefourth mile radius of most dwellings  however a neighborhood center that is within 2400 feet of 80% of the dwellings in the tnd is acceptable in order to allow the center to identify itself jointly with an adjoining

development project some land uses are of a nature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediate surrounding area andor on the entire community that cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards or the criteria governing planned developments there are also circumstances in which a general district designation allowing a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could if properly planned be appropriate for the property and be consistent with the objectives of these regulations the adopted land use plan and other plans for the physical development of the city as adopted by the city council the review process established herein provides for the accommodation of the uses by a reclassification of property into a parallel conditional use district approval process is also established to address those situations when a particular use may be acceptable but the general zoning districts which would allow that use would not be acceptable breclassification and conditional use permit required prior to development 1in order for a property owner to secure privileges for developing property under the parallel conditional use process the property must first be rezoned by the city council to a parallel conditional use district and secondly the owner must secure a conditional use permit in
