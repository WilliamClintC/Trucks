development credit it is the intent of the city to give new and expanding businesses a credit against tapin charges for existing water and sanitary sewer lines for development on currently undeveloped property this credit is to be applied when the proposed development will create new permanent jobs construction activities involved in the project development phase do not constitute the creation of permanent jobs for purposes of this policy the credit development under this policy will be calculated based on the annual payroll of the new or expanded business a credit of onehalf of 1% of the annual payroll up to the cost of the tapin charges for the first five years of operation will be given to offset the costs of the water and sanitary sewer tapin fees example a new business is planning to locate on a tract of ground with 350 feet frontage the charge for the waterline is $5250 350 feet x $15 and the charge for the sanitary sewer is $14000 350 feet x $40 for a total charge of $19250 the new business will start with a first year payroll of $200000 10 employees @ $20000 and gradually increasing to $1200000 60 employees @ $20000 in five years and will remain constant thereafter the credit maximum to be given is calculated as follows  year payroll credit total $ 3500000 $17500  the credit of $17500 would be applied to the $19250 charge resulting in a net charge to the new business of $1750 at the end of the five year period the credit given would initially be based on an estimated payroll and shall be verified on an annual basis for the five year period if more payroll is paid than estimated the difference will be refunded to the business conversely if payroll costs are less than estimated the additional cost will be paid to the city extensions of new lines will be

apurpose it is the purpose of the planned overlay development district to permit a property owner or developer with council and the planning commission to develop a site according to an established plan which would supplement normal zoning requirements of a particular zoning district  however the uses approved within a planned overlay development must conform to the uses as specified in the existing underlying zoning district except as permitted to be modified by this section planned overlay developments allow creative site planning that can result in reduced development costs in exchange for incorporation of amenities such as common open space or increased yards in the overall site design the council may approve a planned overlay development pod based on the guidelines and procedures outlined in this section and bestablishment of planned overlay development districts an overlay district is a mapped zone that imposes additional requirements and procedures over an existing zoning district a planned overlay development district may be approved over any zoning district provided that the plan complies with the procedures and standards of this section and is approved by council the establishment of a planned overlay development consists of three primary steps 1 approval of a concept plan  2 approval of a final plan  and 3 issuance of a development permit this section defines required development standards that set forth the minimum design criteria that must be provided in order to obtain approval this section also specifies review procedures for each step in the approval process the development standards for the design and review of a pod district are set forth in divisions c h the review process and procedures for establishment and approval of a pod district are set forth in divisions i o cyard area use and density regulations the various yard area use density and other development standards for planned overlay development districts are defined and set forth below 1lot size width depth and frontage requirements minimum lot size width depth and frontage requirements for property or lots in a planned overlay development may be less than the minimums specified in the underlying district if approved by city council as part of the concept plan in no case however may the lot size widths depth or frontage requirements be reduced to be less than 50% of the required standard in the underlying district 2peripheral setback the peripheral setback is the minimum setback for buildings parking and streets along the boundary of any pod if a planned overlay development involves a subdivision the front side and rear yards shall be required for each lot in addition to the peripheral setback the peripheral setback for a planned overlay development site shall be as set forth in the table below required landscape bufferyards may be located within the peripheral setback pod peripheral setback requirements  required if adjacent to a

underlying zoning district height requirement an increase in building height may be approved if the peripheral yard is increased by two feet per foot of height increase over the specified allowable height but no occupied structure shall exceed 45 feet 5permitted uses permitted uses within a residential planned overlay development district shall be those residential uses allowed within the r1 r2 and r3 districts permitted uses within a nonresidential planned overlay development district shall be those uses allowed within the underlying nonresidential zoning district 6development density a development density bonus may be approved by the city based on the requirements of the following divisions and the provision of increased peripheral setback and open space percentages as required ain a residential planned overlay development the density permitted is the same as that of the underlying district or districts the number of dwelling units permitted in a planned overlay development shall be calculated by dividing the gross residential area by the minimum lot size required in the underlying residential district the residential area for a planned overlay development shall be calculated by using the area of the residential development bthe number of dwellings yielded from this calculation shall be used in determining the overall density for the site the planning commission may grant approval for an increase in the number of dwelling units permitted within a residential planned overlay development such approval may be granted if the planning commission finds based on a report by the city staff that the pod provides the required increases specified for open space and peripheral yards and that the pod meets the landscaping buffering lighting and signage as specified by this section the planning commission must also determine that the increase in the number of dwelling units allowed for the pod will not have an adverse or negative impact on the surrounding properties or the neighborhood such determination shall be based on a finding by the commission during the approval of the concept plan in considering adverse or negative impact the planning commission shall consider the effect the increase in dwelling units will have on the provision of public services and the roadway network based on a report submitted by the developer addressing these issues and other potential adverse or negative impacts cthe total number of dwelling units in a planned overlay development may not exceed 125% of the maximum number permitted by the underlying zoning district dfor a nonresidential use the density shall be determined based on the requirements of the underlying zoning district and the limitations that the pod development regulations may impose dopen

the city in future years much of the character and function in any area is established by the configuration of lots and roads in the area the proper layout of a subdivision should be measured against three elements 1circulation the location of lots and streets should reflect the need to serve both local travel and not every street can or should encourage both the role of the subdivision in the overall vehicular movement system of the city area will be reflected in its street layout and design 2function activities which will occur on lots of a subdivision will also relate to the whole city community residents of homes should have reasonable access to neighborhood services such as stores convenience services schools recreation and to community services such as fire and police protection major shopping or employment centers utilities cultural and religious center commercial employment and public areas need to be accessible to their occupants while relating to individual activities within the area 3livability the location and layout of lots should be made with the user in mind for example a balance between open land areas and privacy of individual lots should be attempted irregular useless pieces of land should be avoided pedestrian easements could be included to schools shops or parks bin any subdivision the lots created and public improvements made should relate to community development guides street widths should conform to those established in the major thoroughfare plan land uses and the allowance for public facilities should conform to those in the city master plan and must conform to those in the city zoning code csubdivisions should be laid out with respect to design principles specifically uses should be oriented to exterior or interior views should minimize unnecessary automobile travel should encourage internal pedestrian communication should make maximum use of open space and the like 1980 35 passed 651978  15136 standards for lots athe size shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location of the proposed subdivision and for the type of development contemplated bexcessive depth in relation to width should be avoided no lot should have a depth which exceeds two and onehalf times its width cevery lot shall abut on a publicly dedicated street or on an approved place dexcept in planned developments lots for

rectangular blocks shall be a minimum of 240 feet wide and shall provide for two tiers of lots except for blocks abutting a major street see figure 3 bthe lengths of blocks shall be such as are appropriate in the opinion of the planning commission for the locality and type of development contemplated but shall not exceed 1800 feet where the average size of lots does not exceed two acres in area nor shall they be less than 500 feet long cin any block over 900 feet in length the planning commission may require that a crosswalk or pedestrian way not less than ten feet wide be provided near its center dthe number of intersecting streets along major streets shall be held to a minimum wherever practicable blocks along such trafficways shall not be less than 1200 feet in length eculdesac streets should not exceed 600 feet in length f1larger or more irregular blocks may be allowed when using one of the following arrangements asuperblocka large block which contains uses oriented to the bounding road interior areas are dedicated to parkland commons areas or other activities not requiring street access bcluster housing grouping of houses on smaller lots and combining the remaining land into a common park for residents often houses are clustered about culdesac streets and open space occupies what would normally be backyard areas 2the size and configuration of lots and blocks may vary from specific requirements of these regulations so long as the proposed development is located within a zoning district for planned development or is jointly considered with application for establishment of such a district the layout and design of blocks not meeting specific requirements of these regulations shall be subject to the approval of the planning commission suggested or characteristic superblock and cluster housing layouts are shown on figure 3 gproposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless in the opinion of the planning commission such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracks streets leading to adjoining unplatted property must be provided at intervals not to exceed 1200 feet measured along boundaries adjoining the unplatted property a two foot wide buffer lot shall be provided at the end of such streets to prevent egress until such street is extended into the unplatted property at that time the buffer lot shall revert to the public rightofway deadend portions of such streets shall not exceed 300 feet in length no other deadend streets shall be permitted no other strips of land along track boundaries tending to preclude street extensions will be permitted hproposed streets shall be continuous and in alignment with existing planned or platted streets with which they are to connect iwherever there exists within or adjacent to a subdivision a street designated as a local or collector street or a major thoroughfare by the city master plan sufficient land shall be dedicated to meet

halfwidth street or alley the other half width of such street or alley shall be platted kall streets whether existing or new abutting the boundaries of the subdivision shall be improved to their center lines all existing streets passing subdivision shall be improved for their entire widths and this requirement cannot be avoided by a developer by breaking up a subdivision into two or more plats or by calling different portions of a subdivision by different names such improvements shall include the roadway curbs gutters sidewalks and storm drainage system and shall conform to standards established for the type of street or streets involved local collector or major when the abutting street or street within a subdivision is a collector or major street or to be improved beyond local street standards the developer shall be responsible for the cost of equivalent local street standards as determined by the city engineer if improvement to the street center line is not practical because of elevation differences with existing pavement the developer must agree to petition for the improvement of the street before approval of the preliminary drawing is granted if an existing street and its attendant storm drainage system have already been improved to construction standards in effect at the time the subdivision is filed as determined by the city engineer the planning commission may waive the requirement for improvement of existing streets lland uses abutting major streets are a constant problem they require access to the major street but the traffic they generate often constitutes a hazard to the free flowing traffic on the major streets following are some recommended ways of dealing with lots located on major streets see figure 2 1with access to the major street can be of an elongated nature and of an enlarged size uses placed on these lots are best of an institutional or other nature which generate relatively small amounts of vehicular traffic or which are less affected by noise and congestion of the major street the extra lot depth to some degree will provide a buffer between the noise and traffic on the major street and the land uses themselves 2many of the problems of major streets are the result of their numerous points of traffic entry and exits it is often difficult to enter or exit from the stream of arterial traffic while such movements pose a distinct safety hazard a service road parallel to the major street provides the access to local properties traffic enters the major street at controlled intersections usually placed at intervals of one fourth to onehalf mile 3be laid out to face local and collector streets entering the major streets rather than on the major street itself 4be laid out containing double frontage rears of lots abut major streets while their fronts adjoin interior local streets to prevent access from the rear of these doublefronted lots buffer lots are created paralleling the major street and deeded to the city mproposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit fourway intersections of two local streets shall be required and threeway t intersections discouraged unless spaced a minimum of 500 feet from any other parallel street nalleys shall be platted in all commercial and industrial areas if no other provisions are made for adequate access to parking and loading spaces to provide safe access to residential lots located on major streets alleys must be platted in the rear of such lots or service drives provided in front thereof alleys will not be approved in other locations in residence districts unless required by unusual topography or other exceptional conditions oprivately owned streets used for access to lots shall not be permitted unless specifically approved by the planning commission places shall be used only for local traffic and shall not be the extension or in the

the internal and external function of commercial areas as well as to promote visual attractiveness certain elements should be incorporated in commercial subdivisions 2two factors are significant to commercial areas abecause of the typical pattern of multiple ownerships the coordination of elements such as driveways drives and pedestrian ways becomes critical  and bas commercial development requires specific commercial zoning a careful review of zoning boundaries is necessary to ensure that unusable or mixed areas are not created bcommercial area design 1when rear parking is not provided off street parking should also create an access and service drive with as few driveways as possible 2private streets places should not be encouraged where required they can provide access to lots which would otherwise be inaccessible from a commercial street or they can serve multiple building developments where allowed by zoning normally this condition will be necessary only with planned unit developments pud 3all commercial uses should be accessible only from major streets or from commercial streets as defined by the planning commission traffic for main commercial districts should not be required to travel on local streets neighborhood commercial centers or areas should be served by collector or arterial streets 4excessively deep lots should be avoided commercial uses should not
