the flood control insurance act delegates the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations that are designed to minimize flood losses the city council adopts this division pursuant to this grant of authority the regulations of this division are intended to set out requirements that are not less stringent than those which are required for participation in the national flood insurance program b findings of fact the city council finds that 1 the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c purpose it is the purpose of this division to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sanitary sewer lines  streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area d interpretation in the interpretation and application of the floodplain management regulations all provisions shall be 1 considered as minimum requirements  2 liberally construed in favor of the city  and 3 deemed neither to limit or repeal any other powers granted under state statutes or the citys home rule charter e methods in order to accomplish its purposes this division sets out regulations that 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters     228438 4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other

bufferyard landscaping classifications a generally the district bufferyards that are required by this udc are based on the amount of screening ie opacity they provide bufferyards are classified from less screening type a to more screening type c b purposes of bufferyards bufferyards are used to screen development from streets and abutting properties to enhance the streetscape to improve compatibility of abutting uses and to protect natural resources from impacts of nearby development c opacity and width standards 1 opacity standards the opacity of the bufferyard is a measure of the percentage of the view that is blocked by the bufferyard from grade to a height of 35 feet opacity relates to planting density plant forms bufferyard widths and the presence of structures eg fences and walls or topography eg natural slopes or constructed berms 2 width standards comparable opacities can be achieved with bufferyards of different widths however in certain circumstances eg where noise dust runoff or other nonvisual impacts are to be mitigated by the bufferyard the width of the bufferyard may be as important or more important than its opacity where bufferyard widths are specified by limited or conditional use standards option 2 in subsection d with narrower widths is not allowed unless a structure is specifically required as part of the limited or conditional use standards d bufferyard options there are two bufferyards options landscape only bufferyards are the preferred option and use a higher density of plant material to screen abutting properties for properties more constrained by size a second option provides a similar level of screening but allows a berm or fence to be used in conjunction with a smaller width of landscape strip and lower density plant material each option identifies the width of the buffer and the numbers and types of plants required per 100 linear feet or portion thereof the minimum planting requirements for each type and composition of bufferyard are set out in table  bufferyard classifications which is then combined with the district street and railroad and parking lot buffer design standards set out in bufferyard

and avoid flooding damage or safety risks there is a need to clean stormwater to maintain the health of the waterbodies and watercourses in the community by reducing or eliminating pollutants before they reach them there are three strategies that may be applied as part of the stormwater treatment process including avoidance minimization and mitigation for the most part avoidance strategies are built into this udc as are a number of minimization strategies the udc is based on making maximum use of avoidance and then minimization 2 mitigation mitigation is required prior to discharging stormwater into streams with a defined watercourse or channel except where community stormwater management facilities intended to serve the area of the development exist downstream the extent to which the mitigation facilities are needed depends on the degree to which the avoidance and minimization techniques are used in addition to calculating the reduced size of the detention facilities the extent of the cleaning capacity shall be calculated the following are best management techniques a retention with vegetation the preferred stormwater best management practice is initial retention and infiltration of runoff in depressed landscape or natural areas including low impact development see subsection c low impact development below these areas should be shallow and vegetated with natural vegetation that can tolerate temporary ponding of water all such facilities shall be designed to hold a threeinch storm these in conjunction with vegetative swales if properly designed may eliminate or sharply reduce the need for a settlement basin b wet basin wet basins are most effective in cleaning stormwater the basin shall be at least a twopart basin with an initial pool for settlement of solids that has a cleanout access point the second part is the detention basin where water is detained for additional treatment all wet basins shall be designed with wetland buffers on the safety ledges at the area that separates the settlement pool from the main basin outlet and inlet the water retained in the basin between flow events is actively cleaned so that when stormwater comes in the cleaner water is pushed out where feasible these basins shall be used c dry basin these basins are designed to drain within 24 hours for which water quality treatment is negligible they may require use in conjunction with avoidance techniques that address the majority of the water quality treatment or a combination of minimization and mitigation techniques b drainage 1 generally drainage systems shall be designed according to the standards of this any applicable drainage plan and per the specifications of the city engineer 2 adequate rightsofway required whenever any waterbody watercourse or surface drainage channel is located in an area that is being subdivided the subdivider shall dedicate adequate rightsofway that are sufficient to provide for the drainage course and access for the purposes of cleaning widening deepening sloping improving or protecting the watercourse and for drainage maintenance 3 separate easement required drainage easement or rightofway shall not be considered a part of street rightofway 4 prohibited encroachment along a drainage channel shall not encroach upon or into a drainage easement 5 required review and approval all design features for stormwater drainage in a development shall be subject to the approval of the city engineer should there be sitespecific conditions that warrant or demand deviation from the above criteria these considerations may be reviewed by the city engineer such a request for deviation shall be made in writing with supporting documentation approval of any deviation from these specifications shall be made in writing by the city engineer cost alone shall not be sufficient grounds for approval of a deviation the building official shall be notified in writing of any approved deviations from the specifications contained in this subsection 6 improvement standards a surface drainage an adequate drainage system including necessary closed drainage systems pipes culverts intersectional drains drop inlets bridges and other drainage improvements shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water storm catchbasins shall be located such that a maximum of 450 linear feet drains into two basins    255438 b runoff reduction requirement drainage systems shall include a means of retentiondetention to provide a 10 percent reduction in runoff from preconstruction conditions requests for a

or an approved equal and a minimum of 15 inches or greater in diameter as determined by the city engineer d requirements for storms i rainfalls from twoyear frequency shall carry storm runoff without overflowing the curbs ii rainfalls from two to fiveyear frequency shall carry storm runoff into storm sewers culverts or bridges iii rainfalls from 50year frequency shall carry storm runoff into culverts and bridges 7 stormwater managementdrainage report any owner developer subdivider or their agent who apply to subdivide develop improve or build any residential or nonresidential development or subdivision must in addition to any other requirement of law or ordinance submit a stormwater managementdrainage plan designed by a registered engineer in the state of texas including the following a subdivision and site plan applications shall be accompanied by a stormwater managementdrainage report which shall include at a minimum the following information i a cover sheet with the name of the subdivision and the contact information for the engineering firm that prepared the stormwater managementdrainage report  ii a summary sheet that shows a project location  b existingproposed conditions

drainage area map that shows a delineation of all contributing areas  b contours  c spot elevations  d direction of flow  e rightofwayproperty lines and dimensions  and f existing and proposed storm sewer system including outfall iv a calculations sheet that shows a time concentration estimates  b runoff coefficient assumptions  and c storage volume calculations b stormwater managementdrainage facilities shall be provided and constructed at the expense of the applicant pursuant to city stormwater management policy and as specified by the city engineer the applicant shall be solely responsible for the design and installation of drainage facilities so as to prevent flooding or like damage to any abutting property 8 environmental safety subdivision and site plan applications must be accompanied by a stormwater management plan for the development construction phase to include silt fencing hay bales or other proven practices of runoff mitigation measures c low impact development lid 1 allowed lid techniques the following are techniques that can be used to minimize the impact of impervious surfaces by reducing connected impervious surfaces to a minimum thereby reducing the area and cost of mitigation techniques a water gardens convey drainage from rooftops or drives to water gardens the water garden shall be landscaped with natural vegetation that includes unmowed ground covers and woody plants that can tolerate periodic inundation when conveying the roof runoff to open spaces with natural vegetation care must be taken to assure sheet flow not channelized flow to prevent erosion    256438 b rain barrels or cisterns rain barrels or cisterns can be designed into the buildings or yards so that roof runoff is directed to these storage facilities and used for beneficial purposes such as lawn watering vehicle washing or other nonpotable purposes a variety of commercial products are available for this purpose their installation must be partly assured by the subdividers surety c pervious pavements residential driveways and nonresidential and mixeduse parking spaces not access or parking aisles nor ada parking spaces or loading areas may be constructed from pervious concrete to provide infiltration of runoff pervious concrete or asphalt is recommended for minor roads or heavily used parking areas concrete or other containment structures that hold gravel or turf are recommended for driveways or low use parking areas d vegetated swales these shall be used unless the subdivider can show they are impractical or that the slopes would result in erosion e swale blocks the swale block is installed at intervals along a vegetated swale to allow the water to build up into a series of pools slowing water flow and allowing the vegetation to assist in cleaning the water and settling out solids the blocks shall be slotted to allow them to drain down and have a notch to permit maximum flows during the 50year storm without overflowing the swale their use slows flows and decreases pollutant loading and the detention facilities shall be sized to account for the reduction in flows f curb and gutter curb and gutter systems and their associated storm sewer system are undesirable because they greatly increase peak discharge rate and prevent infiltration or treatment of stormwater curb and gutter systems shall be used only where needed to contain parking when swales cannot safely convey the volume and peak discharge rate of stormwater without erosion or where curbs are needed to contain parking on streets when roads transverse open space areas curbs shall be removed streets can be narrowed and parking provided in bays allowing parking to be prohibited this eliminates the need for curbs g curbs without storm sewers where curbs are required for parking containment they should be designed with slots or discharge sections to convey the stormwater to swales h green roofs the use of green roofs roofs that have been planted in vegetation shall be strongly encouraged for buildings with roof areas in excess of 40000 square feet these provide both stormwater storage and cleaning of the water 2 requirements low impact development strategies may be used as part of an overall stormwater management program for a parcel proposed for development use of such strategies including integration into landscape areas and onlot open spaces shall be designed and incorporated into the overall stormwater managementdrainage report set out in subsection b above and as applicable a landscape plan set out in landscape plan approval

nonconforming the city will not require the combination of lots pursuant to paragraph c1a above if see figure  combination of nonconforming  i the combination of lots would not address the nonconformity  ii the combination of lots would materially disrupt the lotting pattern of the street for example by creating a midblock on a street segment that does not include any other   iii two or more of the lots are developed with principal buildings and the combination of lots would require that one or more of the buildings be torn down in order to comply with this udc  iv the combination of lots would result in regularly shaped lots being combined into a single lot with an irregular shape  or v the lots are located in the nc or nt district in which case they are not nonconforming figure  combination of nonconforming construction on legal do not conform to dimensional requirements a legal lot that does not meet zoning district requirements with respect to lot area or lot width may be

many instances minor nonconforming uses are integral parts of the citys fabric that is its character and function so their continuing existence promotes the citys policy objective of protecting its neighborhoods in these instances the classification nonconformity and resulting restriction on investment may not be what the community desires as such the use may be made conforming pursuant to this order to remove the potential stigma that may be associated with the nonconforming designation b procedure an owner of a minor nonconforming use may apply for a conditional use permit which has the effect of making the nonconforming use conforming the criteria for conditional use approval are set out in subsection c d criteria for approval c exclusions this procedure does not apply to

practices eliminate nuisances such as noise light waste materials unreasonably congested onstreet parking or similar conflicts c there is no material history of complaints about the use a history of complaints is justification for denying the conditional use permit unless the conditions of the permit will eliminate the sources of the complaints d the use has been maintained in good condition and its classification as a nonconformity would be a disincentive for such maintenance 2 conditions conditions may be imposed relative to the expansion of bufferyards landscaping and landscape areas or
