watercourses due to unrestricted sedimentation and water quality impacts in receiving water bodies bthe funding for storm drainage and surface water control in the city needs to meet current and future needs to protect private and public property from damage caused by urban stormwater runoff cthe existing storm drainage and surface water runoff facilities must be adequately inspected maintained operated and replaced funding program dthat the extent of impervious groundcover increasing the amount and rate of storm drainage or surface water runoff from a parcel of property is therefore the primary factor determining an individual propertys contribution to the flow rate and quantity of runoff from such property into the citys storm drainage and surface water control system ethat all developed real property within the corporate boundaries of the city contributes runoff to the citys stormwater drainage system and that all developed property benefits from the stormwater management efforts of the city and should participate financially in the payment of all expenses for administration maintenance operation and improvement of such stormwater drainage system fthe city has retained parametrix and their subconsultant financial consulting solutions group inc to develop a financial and management analysis of storm drainage and surface water needs for the city including evaluation of revenue sources to meet these needs their analysis is documented in the 2005 stormwater comprehensive plan gthe city filed an application with the washington state department of ecology for a municipal stormwater national pollution discharge elimination system permit as required by law in march 200 and received a permit in february 2007 under this permit the utility is required to add programs enhance some of the utilitys operations and maintenance functions and perform additional actions as required for permit compliance hthe city requires the use of low impact development lid techniques for stormwater management as specified in chapter 1348 smc by keeping the amount of effective impervious surface to a minimum amending soils and utilizing the natural absorption and cleansing abilities of the soil and vegetation to detain retain andor treat storm runoff the use of lid strategies produces cleaner and cooler runoff water than is normally obtained using conventional

1504 the board of appeals provisions previously codified in the chapter have been replaced by the appeals process in the 2015 international building by variances  required conditions agenerally the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing items 1 in subsection d of smc  have been fully considered as the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases bvariances may be issued for the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set forth in this section cvariances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result dvariances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief evariances shall only be issued upon 1a showing of good and sufficient cause  2a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  3a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in smc d or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances fvariances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants or economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare gvariances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry floodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria except subsection a of this section and otherwise complies with the general standards set out in smc  and  hany applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced

specific areas of concern that isare leading the city to consider a ds  and 3state that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts revising the environmental checklist andor permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications das much as possible the city should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures ewhen an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal along with a revised or amended environmental checklist the city shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within 15 days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal 1if the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures to remove all negative impacts the city shall issue and circulate a dns under wac 197113402 2if the city indicated areas of concern but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a dns the city shall make the threshold determination issuing a dns or ds as appropriate 3the applicants proposed mitigation measures clarifications changes or conditions must be in writing and must be specific for example proposals to control noise or prevent stormwater runoff are inadequate whereas proposals to muffle machinery to x decibel or construct 200foot stormwater retention pond at y location are adequate 4mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated dns may be incorporated in the dns by reference to agency staff reports studies or other documents fmitigated dnss issued under either wac 197113402 which requires a 14day comment period and public notice or wac 197113555 which may require no additional comment period beyond the comment period on the notice of application gmitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated dns shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city hif the citys decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated dns for the proposal the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with wac 197113403 withdrawal of dns ithe citys written response under subsection c2 of this section shall not be construed as determination of significance in addition preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal as opposed to a written request for early notice shall not bind the city to consider the clarifications or

section 1restoration the manipulation of the physical chemical or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former or degraded wetland for the purpose of tracking net gains in wetland acres restoration is divided into areestablishment the manipulation of the physical chemical or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former wetland reestablishment results in a gain in wetland acres and functions activities could include removing fill material plugging ditches or breaking drain tiles brehabilitation the manipulation of the physical chemical or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of repairing natural or historic functions of a degraded wetland rehabilitation results in a gain in wetland function but does not result in a gain in wetland acres activities could involve breaching a dike to reconnect wetlands to a floodplain or return tidal influence to a wetland 2establishment creation the manipulation of the physical chemical or biological characteristics of a site to develop a wetland on an upland or deep water site where a wetland did not previously exist establishment results in a gain in wetland acres activities typically involve excavation of upland soils to elevations that will produce a wetland hydroperiod create hydric soils and support the growth of hydrophytic plant species aif a site is not available for wetland restoration to compensate for expected wetland andor buffer impacts the approval authority may authorize creation of a wetland and buffer upon demonstration by the applicants qualified wetland professional that ithe hydrology and soil conditions at the proposed mitigation site are conducive for sustaining the proposed wetland and that creation of a wetland at the site will not likely cause hydrologic problems elsewhere  iiadjacent land uses and site conditions do not jeopardize the viability of the proposed wetland and buffer eg due to the presence of invasive plants or noxious weeds stormwater runoff noise light or other impacts  and iiithe proposed wetland and buffer will eventually be selfsustaining with little or no longterm maintenance 3enhancement the manipulation of the physical chemical or biological characteristics of a wetland site to heighten intensify or improve specific functions or to change the growth stage or composition of the vegetation present enhancement is undertaken for specified purposes such as water quality improvement floodwater retention or wildlife habitat enhancement results in a change in some wetland functions and can lead to a decline in other wetland functions but does not result in a gain in wetland acres activities typically consist of planting vegetation controlling nonnative or invasive species modifying site elevations or the proportion of open water to influence hydroperiods or some combination of these activities applicants proposing to enhance wetlands or associated buffers shall demonstrate how the proposed enhancement will increase the wetlandsbuffers functions how this increase in function will adequately compensate for the impacts and how existing wetland functions at the mitigation site will be protected 4protectionmaintenance preservation removing a threat to or preventing the decline of wetland conditions by an action in or near a wetland this includes the purchase of land or easements or repairing water control structures or fences this term also includes activities commonly associated with the term preservation preservation does not result in a gain of wetland acres permanent protection of a category i or ii wetland and associated buffer at risk of degradation can be used only if athe approval authority determines that the proposed preservation is the best mitigation option  bthe proposed preservation site is under threat of undesirable ecological change due to permitted planned or likely actions that will not be adequately mitigated under existing regulations  cthe area proposed for preservation is of high quality or critical for the health of the watershed or basin due to its location some of the following features may be indicative of highquality sites icategory i or ii wetland rating using the wetland rating system for western washington  iirare or irreplaceable wetland

compensatory mitigation compensatory mitigation actions shall generally be conducted within the same subdrainage basin and on the site of the alteration except when the applicant can demonstrate that offsite mitigation is ecologically preferable the following criteria will be evaluated when determining whether the proposal is ecologically preferable when considering offsite mitigation preference should be given to using alternative mitigation such as a mitigation bank an inlieu fee program or advance mitigation 1there are no reasonable opportunities on site or within the subdrainage basin eg onsite options would require elimination of highfunctioning upland habitat or opportunities on site or within the subdrainage basin do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts considerations should include anticipated replacement ratios for wetland mitigation buffer conditions and required widths available water to maintain anticipated hydrogeomorphic classes of wetlands when restored proposed flood storage capacity and potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife impacts such as connectivity  2onsite mitigation would require elimination of highquality upland habitat  3offsite mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the altered wetland  4offsite locations shall be in the same subdrainage basin unless aestablished watershed goals for water quality flood storage or conveyance habitat or other wetland functions have been established by the city and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site  or bcredits from a statecertified wetland mitigation bank are used as compensation and the use of credits is consistent with the terms of the certified bank instrument  or cfees are paid to an approved inlieu fee program to compensate for the impacts  5the design for the compensatory mitigation project needs to be appropriate for its location ie position in the landscape therefore compensatory mitigation should not result in the creation restoration or enhancement of an atypical wetland gtiming of compensatory mitigation it is preferred that compensatory mitigation projects be completed prior to activities that will impact wetlands at the least compensatory mitigation shall be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the action or development construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries wildlife and flora 1the administrator may authorize a onetime temporary delay in completing construction or installation of the compensatory mitigation when the applicant provides a written explanation from a qualified wetland professional as to the rationale for the delay an appropriate rationale would include identification of the environmental conditions that could produce a high probability of failure or significant construction difficulties eg project delay lapses past a fisheries window or installing plants should be delayed until the dormant season to ensure greater survival of installed materials the delay shall not create or perpetuate hazardous conditions or environmental damage or degradation and the delay shall not be injurious to the health safety or general welfare of the public the request for the temporary delay

for case i ii and iii lahars published by the us geological survey revised 1998 usgs openfile report 98428 volcanic hazard areas also include areas that have not been affected recently but could be affected by future such events volcanic hazard areas are classified into the following categories 1inundation zone for case i lahars areas that could be affected by cohesive lahars that originate as enormous avalanches of weak chemically altered rock from the volcano case i lahars can occur with or without eruptive activity the average reoccurrence rate for case i lahars on mount rainier is about 500 to 1000 years 2inundation zone for case ii lahars areas that could be affected by relatively large noncohesive lahars which most commonly are caused by the melting of snow and glacier ice by hot rock fragments during an eruption but which can also have a noneruptive origin the average time interval between case ii lahars from mount rainier is near the lower end of the 100 to 500year range making these flows analogous to the socalled 100year flood commonly considered in engineering practice btime travel zones the ability to evacuate people from within a volcanic hazard area correlates to the distance from the source of an event ie those areas closest to the event will have less time to evacuate than those areas farther away from the source of an event and the amount of time for evacuation from the public notification via a warning alarm system that a lahar event has occurred the amount of time that is anticipated for a debris flow lahar flood or avalanche estimated at 100
