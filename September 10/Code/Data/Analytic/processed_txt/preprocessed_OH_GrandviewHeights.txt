business regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen building fifteen  five prevention part seventeen  health  editors note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories

probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact  ca person acts recklessly when with heedless indifference to the consequences the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the persons conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature a person is reckless with respect

offense provides that negligence suffices to establish an element thereof then recklessness knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element when recklessness suffices to establish

herein will not stop flooding or the damage caused by flooding they do establish a basis for design which will 1 minimize the damage and inconvenience of flooding  2 provide drainage systems which

work the city realizes that there may be individual projects involving special or unusual drainage design problems exceptions may be granted by the public service director to the policies and criteria in such cases when engineering studys justify modification bexperience has shown that most of the more serious flooding situations are created development can lead to ever increasing flooding problems unless wellconceived cooperative stormwater drainage and flood control programs are undertaken throughout the entire watershed for this reason the general policy of the city of grandview heights shall be 1land uses and developments which increase runoff rate or volume shall control the discharge rate of runoff prior to its release to offsite land 2it is the responsibility of the property owner to not change or alter any drainage course ditch flood routing path or drainage system on his property that will damage or cause flooding to adjacent upstream or downstream property owners 3all stormwater drainage systems including conveyances within a development shall be designed to have capacity and depth including sufficient invert elevations to permit future connections to serve that total tributary area at the design storm frequency and based on the rate of single family residential runoff the system for the upstream tributary area must be extended development 4all proposed development with a runoff rate greater than that which the downstream system has capacity for or will be designed for will be required to control the rate of stormwater discharge 5all developments having existing controls located downstream from the site will be required to control the flow rate of stormwater discharge to that rate which existed prior to development 6all information necessary shall be submitted to the city to determine how stormwater runoff should be controlled within the development prior to its release to downstream properties the tributary area and the upstream watersheds should be determined using natural land divides unless man made alterations are approved by the city engineer as the basis for watershed delineations the stormwater management policy applies to all land developments not specifically exempted or granted a waiver as provided under the appropriate section of this policy cadequate drainage outlet surface water runoff from a

be waived the application shall include sufficient technical detail to determine that granting a waiver will not result in increased flooding and that the added volume of runoff will not damage the

creative land use regulations to the development or redevelopment of land is often difficult or impossible within the constraints of traditional zoning district standards in order to permit the implementation of more flexible land use regulations and to facilitate the use of the most advantageous techniques of land development it is often necessary to establish a planned unit development district designation in which development is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this zoning the community plan the objective of a planned unit development district is to encourage ingenuity imagination and creative design efforts on the part of builders architects site planners and developers and to produce development that is in keeping with overall land use intensity and design standards of this zoning the community plan while departing from the strict application of the dimensional standards of the traditional zoning districts planned unit development districts are intended to allow design flexibility and provide performance standards that may 1 ensure that development and redevelopment occurs in general accordance with the community plan  2 result in a desirable environment with more amenities than would be possible strict application of the standards of other zoning districts  3 provide for an efficient use of land and public resources resulting in co location of harmonious uses to share facilities and services and a logical network of utilities and streets thereby lowering public and private development costs  4 foster the safe efficient and economic use of land transportation public facilities and services  5 encourage concentrated mixeduse land development patterns which decrease the length of automobile travel encourage public transportation allow trip consolidation and encourage pedestrian circulation between land uses  6 ensure a more rational and compatible relationship between residential and nonresidential uses for the mutual benefit of all  7 further the economic development goals of the city  8 allow for innovations in land development and redevelopment  9 result in the formation or strengthening of identifiable
