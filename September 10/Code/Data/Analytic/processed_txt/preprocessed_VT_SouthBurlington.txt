water pollution control fats oil and grease i introduction fats oil and grease in the sewer system is the source ofmany sewer line blockages and sewer overflows in south burlington many man and equipment hours are dedicated to unclogging these lines animal and vegetablebased oil and grease most often enter the sewer system in their melted form in the sewer system these fats and oil cool and solidify this solidified grease collects on the walls ofthe sewer line resulting in reduced capacity line blockages and sanitary sewer overflows sewer overflow are a very serious matter these overflow events discharge raw untreated sewage onto public and private properties and into our local streams and rivers nation wide 30 to 35 % of all sewer overflows is caused by fats oil and grease blockages in an effort to resolve this problem the city of south burlington has developed a grease control program the program will combat the grease problem education inspections and enforcement in april of 2001 the south burlington city council adopted an ordinance amendment regarding the use of grease oil and sand separators by city businesses during the last year the city has experienced multiple backups of sanitary sewage into private homes caused by a buildup of grease in the sewer mains while the existing ordinance required your business to have a grease trap the amendment establishes permitting and enforcement procedures to go into effect  ii grease interceptor requirements permitting  the application should be sent to ray belair officer 575 dorset street south burlington vermont

changes to an existing grease trap or install a new one a new permit will be required proper sizing in order to perform correctly grease interceptors must be adequately sized the city of south burlington requires that all grease interceptors provide a minimum of 12 minutes retention time at theoretical peak flow rate the following chart can be used to calculate the theoretical peak flow rate based on fixtures connected to the interceptor peak flow rate values by fixture type fixture unit peak flow rate gallonsminute hand sink 75 restaurant kitchen sink 15 single compartment scullery

minimum sizing requirements some facilities may be granted exemption from minimum sizing requirements if they can demonstrate that space restrictions preclude the installation ofa properly sized interceptor in extreme situations financial hardship nlay be considered as a course for exemption in evaluation offinancial hardship situations the division ofwater pollution control will consider the installation costs verses the grease removal benefit and weather or not other suitable options are available the final decision will be made by the city design requirements grease interceptors shall be constructed of constructed of impervious material capable of withstanding extreme changes in temperature shall 3 be of substantial construction watertight and equipped with easily removable covers the interceptor shall contain a baffle system which adequately diverts and slows the flow to avoid shortcircuiting interceptors located in parking lots should be traffic rated maintenance grease interceptors should be cleaned on a regular basis to ensure efficient operation the necessary frequencies of cleaning will vary depending on the nature of the facility factors that may affect cleaning frequency types of food cooking methods cleaning techniques canyout verses dinein and all will determine the volume of grease discharged facilities with high grease loadings may need to clean their interceptors as often as monthly facilities with undersized interceptors especially under thecounter units should clean their interceptors weekly or even daily to properly clean a grease interceptor the entire contents liquid and solid need to be pumped out leaving accumulated solids in the bottom of grease interceptors can lead to shortcircuiting and reduce retention times as well as producing unpleasant odors maintenance of extemallarge grease interceptors should be performed by qualified grease or septic haulers these services will empty the entire contents with a pumper truck and haul the grease to an approved site the following is a list of haulers with an agreement with the division of water pollution control south burlington haulers listed in alphabetical order phone bundys

for verification a copy ofthe grease interceptor permit issued by the city of south burlington shall be kept on file at the facility the permit has been issued to proper placement ofinternal grease traps the placement of internal grease traps is the key solution to grease removal the largest point source of grease to the sewer system is dish cleaning area especially the prerinse cycle before the dishwasher if a facility uses a three compartment sink for dish and cookware cleaning then the three compartment sink would be the best place for the grease trap some facilities with multiple sources of grease may need to install more than one grease trap food disposals should not be connected to the grease trap or interceptor iii how does a grease interceptor or trap work a grease interceptor or trap is a device designed to slow the flow of greaseladen waters to allow for gravity separation the unit contains a baffle system which redirects and slows the flow of water good separation requires a minimum of 12 minutes detention time based on the peak flow rate water entering the unit takes 12 minutes to exit the unit this is enough time to allow for the majority of grease to float and be trapped in the baffle system and for the solids to settle to the bottom of the unit 5 sample grease interceptor 7 awnul on s lids cumlnla1t1on  iv best management practices fats oil and grease can be

burlington interim bylaws i purpose our community values a balance among our natural open spaces and our developed residential and commercial spaces so that the flora and fauna coexist alongside human dwellings schools industries and services all of these spaces will sustain our economic viability going forward together these spaces provide for the benefit of our residents and visitors clean fresh air to breathe clean water to drink and swim in recreational opportunities homes jobs and valuable industries and services as more homes are built in south burlington we must examine carefully the intensity and nature of development and its potential impacts on the balance that we seek to maintain based on previous studies the city needs to review developable lands outside of the transit overlay district and certain business park areas including undeveloped open spaces forest blocks and working landscapes such as the citys remaining large farms and parcels in the institutional & agricultural district city staff regularly considers the infrastructure and staffing needs short and long term of the community for the past three years some city department heads have raised concerns about an ongoing strain on city resources in the face of ongoing development south burlington must continue to safeguard against the possibility that the costs of emergency services and construction and maintenance of sewers and roads will outstrip city revenues such that city residents and business will face the prospect of an acute increase in their tax burden for all these reasons the city council has adopted a smart growth strategy in its policy initiatives including the preservation of open spaces forest blocks and working landscapes and amended the land development regulations to encourage dense development in our urban core which includes city center and the shelburne road corridor we also have sought to encourage commercial development and construction of affordable housing however the pace of residential development has outstripped the planning tools and processes intended to ensure sustainability and encourage affordability with the delicate ecosystems and preparedness of both our natural and constructed infrastructure in mind the city needs to determine what locations types and densities of development are most desirable in order to maintain the balance between natural and developed spaces and sustainability and to avoid a fiscal crisis  not when it is upon us but before we reach that point south burlington interim bylaws adopted  2 for all these reasons the

recreation  give the planning commission time to complete its extensive study of planned unit developments and master plans which necessarily includes the study of density of development and open space  undertake an analysis of the program for the transfer of development rights established in and by the land development regulations and recommend options for its implementation  conduct a costbenefit analysis of hypothetical development including density and type on existing developable open spaces forest blocks and working landscapes once the city has determined which parcels in south

establishment of traffic overlay zones the following zones are established based on their location in relation to the identified critical intersections or roadways on the overlay district map the location and dimensions of major intersections highvolume roadway segments and the balance of restricted roadway segments as described in this section are shown on the overlay district map the location of the access point to a lot is the main determinant ruling on whether a lot is subject to these regulations in situations where a lot is located in more than one zone the location of the driveway will determine the zone that applies to the parcel a lot that does not directly front on a traffic overlay zone but has an actively used access to it via an easement is subject to the restrictions for that zone however this rule would not apply to an existing lot with an existing access that would be connected to as a result of these access management objectives if a parcel has one driveway in one zone and another driveway in another zone the zone which is more restrictive shall apply to the entire property a lot located in a traffic overlay zone but without access in that zone is not subject to these regulations other locations and types of access are not restricted 1 traffic overlay zone 1 zone 1 shall consist of all lots within a specified distance from a major intersection as identified on the overlay district map the distances from the intersection are defined as centerline to centerline distances between the closest driveway of the subject lot and the

allowable traffic generation traffic budget the size of an allowable use on any lot in a traffic overlay zone shall be such that its traffic generation will not exceed the maximum allowable traffic generation  the traffic budget the traffic budget is calculated by multiplying the size of the lot by the maximum traffic generation rate ie maximum peak hour trip ends per 40000 sf applicable to the traffic overlay zone in which the lot is located as shown in table 101 below in the determination of the allowable maximum size for a use the definitions and standards in this shall apply specific procedures and examples are contained in appendix b if the maximum permitted size for a use or any lot is too small to allow reasonable activity normally associated with that use then that use shall not be  article 10 overlay districts south burlington land development regulations permitted on the lot the maximum size of a proposed use must be in compliance with all other zoning regulations of

or may approve peak hour traffic volumes above the standards set forth in f above for a lot in a traffic overlay zone if the development review board or within the form based the administrative officer determines that other site improvements with respect to improved access management internal circulation connections between adjacent properties and improved pedestrian andor transit access will produce a net benefit for traffic flow in the immediate vicinity of the project see appendix b for guidance on adjustments 2 in the event that the existing peak hour trip generation of the uses

generation data and calculation procedures south burlington land development regulations b traffic generation data and calculation procedures b1 calculating the maximum allowable traffic generation traffic budget the maximum allowable traffic generation is a function of the specific traffic overlay district zone that the parcel is located in a function of the type of connection if the parcel is located in zone 2 and a function of the size of the parcel if for instance a parcel is located in zone 2 along a highvolume roadway section and it is proposed to be connected via a private driveway case 2a and the parcel has a total area of 60000 square feet the maximum allowable traffic generation is 6000040000 x 20 equals 30 vehicle trips if that same parcel would be connected to the highvolume roadway via a public road with a signalized intersection or a roundabout case 2c the maximum allowable traffic generation would be 6000040000 x 30 equals 45 vehicle trips the maximum allowable traffic generation refers to the number of vehicle trips generated during the afternoon pm peak hour of the adjacent street traffic the highest continuous hour between 4 pm and 6 pm the actual traffic generation of the proposed use as calculated per sections b2 and b3 below must not exceed the maximum allowable traffic generation  the traffic budget b2 calculating the traffic generation of the proposed use to calculate the traffic generation of the proposed use the applicant must use the latest version of the ite trip generation manual the 7th edition of 2003 and subsequent editions the ite rates must be used whenever possible the following are specific guidelines that need to be followed choice of independent variable the independent variable is the characteristic of the proposed project that is used to estimate the projects traffic generation for many uses the ite manual gives a choice of independent variables that can be used for instance for office buildings one can use the gross building floor area or the number of employees as an independent variable for the purposes of these land development regulations it is recommended that a primary measurement be used as the independent variable not a derived measurement for instance for office buildings the floor area is a primary measurement whereas the number of employees is generally an estimate based on the floor area the independent variable should be easily verifiable and should be related to the land use type not to the characteristics of the tenantoperator the independent variable that relates to the size of the use and that is the best trip generation predictor for the pm peak hour of the adjacent street traffic one hour between 4 pm and 6 pm has to be used see the ite trip generation handbook an ite recommended practice march 200 for more explanations and guidance use of regression equations or average rates the ite trip generation manual gives weighted average trip generation rates for each use compiled in the manual the use of average rates implies a linear relationship between the size of the use and traffic generation ie traffic generation changes in direct proportion to its size for some uses ite also provides a regression equation that represents a nonlinear curve that best fits the data the use of the regression equation takes into consideration the fact that traffic generation is not always in direct proportion to the size of the use the use of the regression equation is recommended when a a regression equation is provided b the independent variable is within the range of data given by ite and c either the data plot has at least 20 points studies or the coefficient of determination r is greater or equal to 075 and the standard deviation is greater than  appendix b traffic generation data and calculation procedures south burlington land development regulations 110% of the weighted average rate the use of weighted average rates is recommended when a there are at least 4 data points studies b the independent variable is within the range of data given by ite c the standard deviation is less or equal to 110% of the weighted average rate and d r<075 or no equation is provided if ite provides fewer than 4 data points the development review board may require additional local traffic generation studies convenience markets and gasoline providers the ite trip generation manual has trip generation rates for several related uses land use # 944 gasolineservice stations  land use #945 gasolineservice station with convenience market  land use #946 gasolineservice station with convenience market and car wash  land use # 853 convenience market with gasoline pumps  and land uses # 851 and 852 for convenience markets the difference between use 945 and use 853 is the primary purpose of the use the primary business of gasolineservice stations with convenience markets is the fueling of motor vehicles although they may also have facilities for servicing and repairing motor vehicles generally these uses are operated by gasoline companies for convenience markets with gasoline pumps the primary business is the selling of convenience items generally they are operated by companies other than gasoline companies for convenience markets with gasoline pumps use # 853 ite gives pm peak hour generation rates for two independent variables vehicle fueling positions and 1000 sf gross floor area only average rates are given for these two variables the gross floor area has a slightly lower standard deviation 58% of the average as compared to 65% for the vehicle fueling positions and is therefore the recommended variable for this use this is also logical because the sale of convenience items is the primary business of this use for gasolineservice stations with convenience markets the opposite is true the vehicle fueling positions is the recommended variable in some cases the development review board may require the use of more than one independent variable in such cases the applicant shall use the worstcase calculation when local traffic generation studies are required the use of ite trip generation rates as the baseline for these regulations is mandatory because it is considered to be an appropriate measurement of the traffic impacts of a particular use category there are however situations when other traffic generation sources may be required other sources may include professionally conducted traffic generation studies not included in the ite trip generation manual or local trip generation studies conducted for the particular use local trip generation studies are required when a the particular land use is not covered by ite  b there are fewer than 4 data points studies in the ite trip generation manual  or c the size of the use falls outside the range of the trip generation data points four data points are suggested as a minimum for the purposes of this zoning code if ite provides only two data points the development review board may require traffic generation studies at two additional sites daily traffic variation typically traffic generation rates are for an average weekday and are collected on a tuesday if a use has a regular peak on fridays such as shopping centers the friday rate needs to be taken into consideration the procedures given in the ite manual and handbook should be followed traffic generation of multiple uses on one site whenever more than one use or more than one commercial establishment is proposed on one site there is the potential for some vehicle trips to remain internal within the site the total net traffic generation for that site may therefore be less than the sum of the traffic generation volumes for each use or  appendix b traffic generation data and calculation procedures south burlington land development regulations establishment this is sometimes referred to as the shopping center effect as shopping centers increase in size the traffic generation rate per 1000 square feet of floor area decreases to take this effect into consideration it is recommended that the percentage of internal trips be estimated for each trip interchange between the different uses exhibit b1 shows a calculation example for a site with townhouses with a health club and with an office building the percentage of internal trips varies according to the market of that particular use some uses are more oriented to local customers or users and may have a higher percentage of internal trips whereas other uses may draw from a larger distance and would therefore have a lower percentage of internal trips for example a health club tends to draw its customers from a smaller area than the employees in an office building therefore the percentage of internal trips would be higher for the hometohealth club trips than for the hometooffice trips exhibit b1 shows the percentages of internal trips to range from 5% to 15% for the individual interchanges this is a reasonable range for most situations although there may be cases with higher percentages the trip generation handbook an ite recommended practice march 2001 may be consulted for further guidance the percentage of internal trips is applied to the lowest number of each trip interchange for instance for the interchange of trips from the town houses to the health club in exhibit b1 54 trips exit from the town houses and 66 trips enter the health club the 15% is applied to the lowest of the two numbers 54 in this case the resulting trip ends 81 in this case are deducted from both inbound and outbound trips the example in exhibit b1 shows that the total gross traffic generation before credit for internal trips was 396 164 plus 232 for the pm peak hour this gross generation was then reduced by 58 vehicle trips 29 plus 29 to account for internal traffic to yield a net generation of 338 trips 135 plus 203 this represents an overall reduction for internal trips of 1465% as the number of uses or establishments increases the overall percentage of internal trips will increase b 3 estimating the effects of various mitigation strategies the development review board may grant traffic generation credits for a particular application if the applicant commits to or implements measures or changes to the site that reduce the traffic impacts these credits will either decrease the sites estimated traffic generation or they will increase the traffic budget allowed for the site reduction in the number of drivewaysaccess points for each existing driveway that will be eliminated the development review board may grant the applicant a traffic budget credit of 20 vehicle trips for that site if the particular driveway to be eliminated carries more than 40 vehicles during the pm peak hour at the time of the application the allowable increase in traffic budget would be half the number of trips on that driveway if for instance the specific driveway carries today 70 vehicles in the pm peak hour the allowable increase in traffic budget would be 35 vehicle trips however the applicant needs to verify that the remaining driveways will be able to handle the projected traffic with reasonable delays and queues connection to adjacent parcel connecting one parcel to an adjacent parcel is similar to the beneficial effects gained from multiple uses on one site a certain proportion of trips will remain internal to the two parcels instead of being external trips over the citys street network the same calculation methodology is recommended as for the estimation of internal traffic for a site with multiple uses however the calculation must distinguish between the internal trips on the one parcel that is subject to the application and the trips between the two parcels the applicant gets full credit for the internal trips on the subject parcel but only credit for half the trips being made between the two parcels in the case of multiple uses  appendix b traffic generation data and calculation procedures south burlington land development regulations on one parcel all trip ends of the internal traffic are on the same parcel whereas for trips between two parcels half of the trip ends are on one parcel and the other half is on the other parcel exhibit b2 shows an example where parcel a the subject of the application has a mix of a health club and an office and is proposed to be connected to parcel b which has 150 town houses first parcel a gets the credit for the trips being made between the office and the health club  a total credit of 18 trips in this case then parcel a gets credit for half the trips being made between parcel a and b  19 trips in this case the total gross traffic generation of 271 vehicle trips 93 plus 178 has thus been reduced by 18 for internal trips within parcel a plus 19 trips for the interconnection to parcel b a total reduction of 137% the minimum traffic credit for a connection to an adjacent parcel shall be 15 vehicle trips the connection must also include a pedestrian path between the buildings on both parcels the pedestrian path can be a separate path or a striped walkway along the traffic lanes these connections must be practicable all year long and cannot become storage areas for snow if the connection consists of a pedestrian path only the traffic budget credit shall be 10 vehicle trips for the above connections a reciprocal easement agreement shall be established between the two property owners the traffic budget credit that may be granted under this provision is independent of whether the adjacent parcel is in a traffic overlay district zone if a connection consists of emergency access only no credits shall be allowed connection to other roadway connecting to another road or to a roadway section that is not in a traffic overlay district zone will in effect reduce the amount of traffic generated in the traffic overlay district the applicant is allowed to reduce the traffic generation for the purposes of this regulation by the amount of traffic that would reasonably use the connection the percentage of the traffic projected to use the connection must be supported by a traffic distribution analysis the connection under consideration must be practicable all year long and must satisfy standard design requirements for a local driveway connection minimum 11 lanes reasonable grades etc and must be approved by the citys director of public works the connection may be secured official easement or a rightofway acquisition raised mediansright turns in and right turns out left turns in or out of a site are more detrimental in terms of traffic safety and traffic flow than right turns if an applicant eliminates left turns in and out of a site construction of a new raised median the development review board may grant a credit for the reduction or elimination of the left turns this credit may be granted as an increase to the traffic budget and may be as high as 50 % of the amount of leftturn movements eliminated by the new median during the pm peak hour uses with access to an arterial with an existing raised median preventing left turns in and out shall be granted an automatic credit of 50% per g and shall not be eligible for an additional credit for a raised median the applicant needs to submit a traffic study determining the amount of leftturn movements without the raised median and the traffic pattern with the raised median the distribution of traffic must be justified market analysis or a count of similar driveways nearby the impacts of the leftturn elimination on adjacent intersections need to be analyzed the new raised median also needs to be approved by the citys director of public works
