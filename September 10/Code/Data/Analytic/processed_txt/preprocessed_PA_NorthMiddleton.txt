attachm ent i townshipof north middleton appendixa pretreatment program 1 program introduction 11 purpose of pretreatment program the township of north middleton township north middleton authority  provides a municipal sanitary sewage collection system within said township it transports wastewater to its own wastewater treatment plant and to the carlisle regional wastewater treatment plant township is also a party to an intermunicipal agreement with the borough of carlisle carlisle and others whereby it is a contributing municipality for the treatment of wastewater generated in said township carlisle is required to assure the federal environmental protection agency epa and pennsylvania department of environmental protection dep that its contributing municipalities have developed and enforce sewage pretreatment requirements for certain industrial users this pretreatment program is enacted in order to provide uniform regulations which will meet epa and der requiremen ts as well as to regulate wastewater discharged into the sewer system whether such wastewater is ultimately disposed of middleton or the carlisle treatment plants 12 discussion of pretreatment requirements any municipal wastewater treatment facility should be used in the common interest of the public this principle demands that the facility be used in a manner consistent with the purpose and capacities for which it was designed no use should be allowed that could result in physical damage interference with proper operation unreasonable maintenance  attention or expense or pollution as defined by the clean streams law municipal treatment plants are normally designed to receive a relatively dilute influent containing solids and other constituents primarily from domestic sources domestic wastewater has certain settling and biodegradation rates that involve predictable responses when the wastewater is subjected to conventional treatment methods  industrial wastewaters can be much more concentrated or toxic and the constituents may adversely affect the conventional treatment processes usually associated with sewage disposal the pollutants in industrial wastewater can cause a variety of problems at municipal plants such as structural damage inhibition of bacterial action in the biological treatment processes plant upsets and the passtoxic pollutants to the stream resulting in damage to aquatic life or npdes permit violations in addition industrial wastes in municipal treatment plants can cause accumulation of pollutants in sludge that may preclude or limit disposal practices involving incineration landfilling or land application  or expose workers to chemical hazards from poisonous gases or volatile materials many of 164 attachment  01  01  2014 north middleton code these potential problems can result in increased costs for operation of the municipal facility the nature of industrial wastewaters may make pretreatment necessary before they can be discharged to a municipal system pretreatment can generally be defined as any operation used to remove pollutants or change the quality of wastewater to make it acceptable for discharge into a conventional treatment system federal regulations require that any municipal plant with a design flow greater than five million gallons per day develop a local program in addition plants with design flows less than five million gallons per day may also be required to develop a local program if industrial waste contributors cause problems at the facility such as upsets permit violations or sludge contamination protecting the significant investment of public funds made by federal state and local government in the construction and operation of municipal wastewater treatment facilities from damage caused by industrial discharges and providing for the control of the discharge of hazardous and toxic pollutants from indirect sources that could pass systems and cause pollution or contamination of municipal sludges eventually disposed on the land will eventually lead to full implementation of the pretreatment program which will benefit all the citizens of the commonwealth by abating and preventing pollution and by providing a clean and safe supply of water critical for healthy economic development it is the purpose of this document to establish and set forth the local pretreatm ent program to regulate the wastewaters into all wastewater treatment facilities receiving sewage generated in north middleton township 2 definitions unless the context specifically and

users substantial damages of a value not easily ascertainable will be suffered by the township in excess of penalties which may be imposed by governmental agencies upon the township therefore in addition to the requirement that any user reimburse the township for any penalty imposed upon the township as the result of any violations of the pretreatment program by such user it shall be the obligation of any user committing a significant violation to pay to the township as liquidated damages the further sum of $100000 per day for each day in which such significant violat ion continues the liability of any user for such reimbursement for penalties and such pa yment of liquidated damages is an express condition upon which the township predicates any users performance hereunder and

identifying any noncompliances with this program and in responding with the appropri ate enforcement measures while the enforcement guide is directed towards the objective of assuring industrial user compliance with applicable pretreatment requirements the process of meet ing these objectives are to be flexible and dynam ic this guide establishes a system for identifying priorities and directing the flow of enforcement actions based on these priorities and available resources in 3 procedures for compliance screenin g are reviewed and the various categories of noncompliance are defined enforcement options available to the town ship are described in guidelines for applying appropri ate enforcement action to the various categories of noncompliance are provided in this guide has been developed for the internal use of the township and is not intended to create legal rights or obligations or to limit the enforcemen t discretion of the township 72 compliance screening inform ation received will be reviewed to identify noncompli ance with the requirements of the pretreatment program the compliance status of an industrial user w ill generally be assessed semiannually compliance may at the townships discretion  be assessed more frequently at the time that periodic reports on complian ce are required or at such other time as deemed appropri ate by the township for compliance schedule progress and selfmonitoring reports the initial review may determine that the repo1ts have been submitted on schedule cover the appropriate time 164 attachment  01  01  2014 sewers and water period contain the required information and are properly signed the review may entail comparison of the parameters reported the number of measurements recorded for each parameter the method of analysis employed the sampling procedures used the discharge concentration s and mass loadings reported and any other infonnation supplied by any user with the monitoring and reporting requirements contained in the users permit any discrepancy is a violation that may be identified for enforcement action similarly information obtained as a result of scheduled or unscheduled monitoring activities will be reviewed for user noncompliances user facility inspection s may  depending upon the situation confirm that no unreported or unapproved changes in process or character of waste discharged have occurred that sampling monitorin g facilities are operating and in good condition  that pretreatment facilities are being properly operated and maintained that discharge monitoring records for at least the past three years are on file and that the user is aware of the applicable regulations and requirements for handling and storing hazardous material s analytical results obtained from the compliance monitoring activities must be reviewed for violations in discharge limits 73 categories of noncompliance the nature and frequency of noncompliance often determines the appropriate enforcement response to be taken therefore to enable program administrative personnel to respond in a consistent manner  the following categories of noncompliance are defined 1 noncompliance any noncompliance with a users permit requirements or pretreatment program criteria which occur as an infrequent or isolated event and does not meet any of the criteria for significant noncompliance 2 significant noncompliance snc a user is in significant noncompliance if one or more of the following criteria are satisfied a chronic violations sixtysix percent or more of all measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six month period exceed by any magnitude a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement  including instantaneous limits  amended 1022008 by  b technical review criteria trc violation thirtythree percent or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter dming a sixmonth period exceed by any magnitude a numeric pretreatment standard

attachment  01012014 north middleton code d any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human healthwelfare or to the environment has required the potws exercise of its emergency authority consistent with 40 cfr flvib to halt or prevent such a discharge  e failure to meet within ninety 90 days after the scheduled date a compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction completing construction  or obtaining final compliance  f failure to provide within thirty 30 days after the due date required reports such as base line monitoring reports ninetyday compliance reports periodic selfmonitoring reports and reports on compliance with compliance schedules  g failure to accurately report noncompliance  or h any other violation or series or series of violations including a violation of best management practices that the director or the potw determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program amended 1022008 by  3 significant violation  a significant violation is one which rema ins uncorrected 45 days after notification of significant noncompliance  which is part of a pattern of significant noncompli ance over a twelvemonth period   which involved a failure to accurately report significant noncompliance  or which resulted in the potw exercising its emergency authority under 40 cfr 4038flvib  snc status will be evaluated on a sixmonth rolling average ba sis beginning with the first month of each quarter 74 enforcement criteria this enforcement guide provides a process for reviewing and screening industrial user violations to assure that enforcement resources are concentrated on the most serious violations this guide places priority on response to instances of industrial user snc especially by significant industrial users sills as resource s allow nonsiu discharges of concern and other instances of noncompliance are subject to enforcement responses notwithstanding the priority placed on a sius snc it is recognized that it may be appropriate to exercise enforcement discretion even if a siu meets the snc criteria eg snc criteria is triggered due to the result of one sample this guide is intended to provide the township as much flexibility as allowed by applicable federal and state requirements in responding to industrial user violations as such deviations from this guide may occur depending upon the facts of a specific case 164 attachment  01012014 sewers and water furthermore this guide hereby incorporates the conditions and other requirement s set forth in intermunicipal pretreatment agreements between the township and carlisle such agreements as approved by epa are a condition of this enforcement guide and any enforcement actions taken by carlisle will be undertaken in accordance with the conditions set forth in the agreements 75 enforcement response guidelines 1 levels of response there are three possible levels of response to all violations available to the director they include a no response action  b an informal response  and c a forma l response the director will evaluate industrial user noncompliance factors to consider may include but are not limited to severity potential effects to the potw receiving stream and public healthwelfare frequency of occurrence and such other factors as are deemed appropriate for some violations the response may be no action necessary at this time na a decision by township not to initiate an enforcement response for industrial user violations does not absolve the industrial user from any liability or damages should township epa pennsylvania or any other person as appropri ate seek to initiate an enforcement response for such or any other violations by the industrial user if an enforcement response is deemed appropriate enforcement options include informal and formal responses these enforcement respon ses may include but are not limited to i phone call pc ii meeting mtg iii increased monitoring im iv notice of violation nov v modification of industrial users permit to include

each case moreover the identified enforcement response s are not mutua lly exclusive  township may combine any enforcement responses provided for by j aw as it deems appropriate 2 monetary penalties this enforcement guide recogni zes that the pena lty amounts available to township as well as to other authorities under state law may not be sufficient to recover the economic benefit of noncompliance by industrial users in its discretion township may refer any industrial users noncompliance to der andor epa so as to subject the noncompl ying industrial user to the higher penalties available to such agencies under applicable law township may join in any such proceeding or otherwise assist der andor epa eg provide testimony 3 appropr iate respon se ranges a summary of enforcement responses for various levels of noncompliance is included as table 71 when township deems an enforcement response to be appropriate this table compares the noncompliance with the circumstance s surrounding the violation and suggests the appropriate response or range of response s available to the director as stated above for some violations an enforcement response may not be required for example equitable considerations may ju stify township exercise of its enforcement discretion 4 time frames for response s generally the time frame for responses will be based upon the nature of the vio lation and competing pretreatment priorities violations which threaten human health the potw or the environment will be given priority as will snc violations by sius 164 attachment  01 01  2014 sewers and water except as otherwise provided an enforcement response will usually be initiated within ninety 90 days of township undertaking a review of an industrial user file and determining that an enforcement respon se is appropriate this however does not preclude township from responding to a violation in a shorter period of time as it deems appropriate it is also recognized that initiation of some of these enforcement options may be time consuming and result in the initiation of an enforcement action beyond a time period otherwise anticipated table 71 enforcement response guide

development throughout a watershed increases flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge  threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwat er mana gement including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health  safety and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and ba se flow of streams which also protects and ma intains surface water quality d federal and state regu lations require certain municipalities to implement

brown emerson n  miller and roy shughart longtime residents of the township  whose recol lections contributed much of the information found in the following pages north middletown township directly north of carlisle and wrapped neatly halfway around both the east and west ends of town lies a rectangular area of 26 square miles that is nort h middleton town ship she is bounded on the north at the top of north mounta in by perry county to the west are west pennsboro and lower frankford townships and her neighbor to the east is midd lesex township her southern borders are the railroad tracks south of the newvi lle road carlisle bora line and the trindl e road curving around the southern edge of carlisle and meeting north middleton on either side is her sister townsh ip south midd leton inside these boundaries are 16707 acres or enough for about 130 average sized farms this is used as a basis for comparison becau se agriculture was and still is the basic industry of the township there are presently 78 operating farms in north middleton geographical features most of the township area is best described by the words rolling hills hills that push up against the foot of the kautatinchunk or endless mountains as the indians called them these moun tains are part of a long smoothtopped ri dge that extends in a westerly direction from the sus 01 01 2014 north middleton code quehanna river covering the height s is a wide variety of trees ranging from soft workable pines to the flinthard oaks and maples while much of the valley was originally covered by a sparse growth of bu shy vegetation mingled with rich grasses and an abundance of wild fruits and berries there is even a spot approximately in the center of the township called cactus hill where beauti ful springflowering cactus abound in the wild the most singular feature of the topography is the snaking conodoguinet creek for a long way nothing but bends as the indian name indicates this creek by far the largest stream in cumber land county enters north middleton ju st west of meadowbrook and leaves the confines some nine wiggly mi les later just south of the intersection of routes 34 and 499 normally a placid seminavigable creek it sometimes during rainy seasons turns into a raging tonent spilling over its banks and wreaking havoc along the way as it did in recent memory with hurricanes agnes in 1972 and eloise in 1975 the conodoguinet serves as a dividing line be tween the two types of soil found in the town ship the ground north of the stream is composed mainly of slate and shale while on the other side of the water limestone is found in full measure its been said by the son of a former tax collector that limestone farmers grow better crops but slateland farmers pay their taxes faster of course the answer from the other side of the creek is that slate taxes are lower because the land is poorer  actually its ju st about a standoff and the diligent farmer can be successful on either side on the south bank of the creek where it comes closest to the pennsylvania turnpike is a lime stone cave in the side of a steep hill the opening is a semicircular archway about 10 feet high and the passage extends into the cave about 270 feet before it branches into three directions lead ing on the right to a large chamber known as the devil s dining room legends surround the cave like the mist that clings to the creek when the weather is just right lewis the robber supposedly used the cavern as a hideout from time to time during the early 1800s when he was perpetrating his petty crimes in the area  and bones of all kinds were found in the passages by early explorers there is a priceless story about a small dog that entered the mouth of the cave and emerged sometime later in the vicinity of the army post giving rise to the belief that passages run all the way under the east end of carlisle early settlers the first white men to come into the area were the indian traders in the 1720s searching for skins and furs when they carried back across the wide susquehanna tales of the broad and lush valley to the west they were followed in the l730s by increasing numbers the good news of the exciting new land was especially welcome by the scotchirish of lancaster county and other eastern parts of the province that were predominantly german  so much friction had developed between these two groups that finally in 174 the proprietaries refused to sell any more land cast of the susquehanna to the bothersome scotchirish but made liberal offers to the adventurous nationality on lands west of the river it was the hope of the ii 01012014 preface penns to populate lancaster and york counties with the quiet industrious germans and cumber land county with the rowdy scotchirish so successful was the offer that they moved into the cumberland valley by the hundreds  and by 1750 all but 50 families of the 5000 people of the new area were scotchirish many of these people settled in the area that is now north middleton where there was a plentiful supply of both timber and fresh water early land warrants show names like matthews davison bowers reed and watson all of good scotchirish stock the same patents are liberally sprinkled with phrases such as beginning at a marked white oak or continuing to a heap of stones marked trees were a common tool of the early surveyors and often were the only trees left standing after a settler finished clearing his land to farm one of the earliest cluster of people in the township was the gathering known as armstrongs settlement ju st down the creek a short distance from meeting house springs the area had an especially clean and fresh water supply emanating from the springs and was an ideal spot for a few families to settle on another early settler in that area was richard parker who records in the land office indicate set tled on the conodoguinet with his family in 1724 most of these early scotchirish settlers were very impatient with the policies of the penns in which any land to be settled had to first be bought from the indians for a fair price with the rapid influx of these white people the indians became alarmed and reminded the proprietaries repeated ly about unfinished treaties with the indians thus aroused the french took advantage of the situation and allied many of the tribes against the english raids began to take place in the north valley and it was a common sight for the settlers to be working in their newly cleared fields with a rifle near at hand for pro tection a stockade fort lowther was built on the site of the present square in carlisle but with only a few militia to man the fort its condition deteriorated and so did relations between the two races  under constant attack and harassment by the savage natives mostly delawares the citizens peti tioned governor morris for additional protection as a result  colonel stanwix was sent into the cumberland valley and in 1757 erected earth works just outside the town of carlisle on the northeastern edge these earthworks were the be ginning of what would become 200 years later one of the oldest anny posts in the nation the first murder of a friendly indian in cumberland county probably took place in the area that is now north middleton township a delaware by the name of doctor john lived with his wife and 111 01012014 north middleton code two children in a hunting cabin on conodoguinet creek not far from carlisle in the w inter of 1760 although apparently on good enough terms with the white settlers to visit their houses it was said that he boasted of killing 60 white men himself and wou ld gladly do it again if the war resumed  one february morning the bodies of doctor john and his son were found  while his wife and oth er child had disappeared presumably also murdered the biggest fear of the settlers was that repri sals would be made against them by other indians and two years later the case was still being discussed at a conference in philade lph ia between governor hamilton and relatives of the victims formation of the township when the susquehanna was crossed and the westward movement first began lancaster county extend ed indefinitely to the west but in 1750 there were enough inhabitants on the new side of the river to demand a county of their own so that they wou ldn t have to travel to lancaster to transact bu siness in the county seat that year cumberland county was formed made up of east and west pennsborough and middle ton townships in 1810 the latter was divided into north and south middleton and again in 185 midd lesex was carved out leaving north middleton township with its present boundaries churches since the first settlers of the area were scotchirish its only natural that the first church was presbyterian established at meeting house springs about three miles west of carlisle in 1734 in 1757 the congregation moved to carlisle and now there are no presbyterian churches in the township wh ile several churches were formed  served for a period and then went out of existence there are now eight worshipping congregations within the boundaries of north middleton the oldest of these is the waggoners united methodist church on the longs gap road  in 1818 the first class met in the home of phillip waggoner an early evangelical preacher but not until 1851 was the waggoners evangelical church building actually built the cornerstone of the present church reads evangelical church bu ilt in 185 blowed down and rebuilt 1885 and numerous improvements and additions to the structure have been made since lv 0101  2014 preface the cemetery is filled with stones of the late l 800s inscribed with the names of wellknown ear ly families and the oldest legible one belongs to mary ann dunlap wife of john died may 17 185 1 at the age of 70 the other churches in the township are mountain view baptist cornman road great hope baptist  fem drive cavalry road church of god cavalry road triumphant church of god longs gap road church of god in caprivi waggoner s gap road church of the nazarene sterretts gap avenue army war college chapel carlisle barracks barns most indicative of the chara cter of north middleton township in 1976 are its barns for it is after all a sprawling rural community still standing in the township are 78 of the buildings nearly all fine examples of the pennsylvania barn this type is a twostory structure with access to the second floor being gained by a bank built up at the rear of the barn contained on this second level are the granery mows and the threshing floor the barn roofs are mostly gabled types with the two slanted planes of the roof running from the ridge pole or center beam to both the front and the back in addition many of these are a salt box style in which the rear side of the roof extends toward the ground much farther than the front and usually is on the north side of the barn the kind of stone used for the foundation follows closely the underlying rock type of the area of 44 sandstone barns all but one are found north of the conodoguinet creek and all except four of v 01 012014 north middleton code the 17 limestone barns lie south of the creek there are 17 additional barns that utilize a combina tion of the two types or some undetermined rock a great deal of wood wa s used in both the sheathing and the supporting timbers these hewed from trees and held together at the joint s with wooden pegs called trunnels tree nails unique to pennsylvania barn s and present on nearly every one of those in north middleton is the overshot or the part of the second floor that projects out over the lower level in the front of the barn the name came to include the open floor of this area u sually made of concrete and a coarse stone aggregate and there was many a north middleton farm boy whose job it was each morning before school to clean the overshot most of barn s in the town ship were built in the second half of the i 800s but there was a date stone on the original emerson miller barn that read  aw it s safe to say that the first barn erected in the town ship closely followed the coming of the first settler for large barns were a strictly american characteristic and represented the hope of the newcomers  several barns have been built by men still living in the town ship usually following the mo st common cause of destruction fire even the barn s built in the 1940s were constructed exactly like those of the early 1800s at the barn raising from 6070 men would tum out the entire timber framework was laid out on the ground and cut to fit then it was put up piece by piece eight by eight timbers are heavy and it usually took at least four men to put them in place but one man  roy shughart is said to have regularly carried twelve foot eight by eights by him self in fact he built the barn on the minnich farm in one month  from picking the foundation stones off the ground to hewing timbers to finishing the roof in 1943 emerson miller s new barn on route 74 was built by laying out on the ground and only one piece did not fit when it was all put together time may be running out on these native american buildings the pennsylvania barn s each year their number is lessened by a stray bolt of lightning or by the progress called residential develop ment schools  marked the last day that students in north middleton township attended a one room schoolhouse the next september about 450 children  in grades 1 attended the new school now named crestview on long s gap road vi 01012014 preface prior to its openin g there were seven of the oneroom variety scattered over the township they were pleasant hall the oldest union hall willow grove basin hill evergreen fairview  and franklin hall today the student body at crestview is made up of 511 students and the school is the largest elementary school in the carlisle school district 17 teachers work under the administration of the principal richard ocker and plans are under way for a new addition to alleviate crowded condition s presently  three classes are meeting in temporary quarters outside the main school building but the new space will be available for the 197677 school year  bridges with a major creek like the conodogui net winding its way township there is bound to be abundance of bridge s many of these were covered wooden bridges  but they have now all dis appeared from the town ship replaced by concrete and steel in 179 the first spot on the creek to be spanned was the site of hays  bridge on meadowbrook road many of the early bridges succumbed to either fire or the elements and such was the case with hays  bridge the third bridge to stand on the spot was built in 1825 at a cost of $1500 only 21 years after the first covered bridge was ever built in america the structure lasted until 1951 when it was replaced by a modem type after being tom down the last covered bridges built in the township were waggoner s and watts  both being erected in 1889 the last of these to come down was watts when it burned in 1970 for the last six years the road has been closed because no bridge has ever replaced the old span before it was finally razed the waggoner s bridge was offered for sale for $400 by the township supervisors but there were no takers gone forever are the romantic old bridges sides many a schoolbo y made a splash ing jump into the muddy conodoguinet below taverns in the early days of the settlement of the town ship taverns played an important political as well as socia l role many times it was in these inns that leaders and politicians met to develop philoso phies or even plot rebellion as travel increased so did the frequency of accommodation s and in the early 1800s there were several taverns along the stagecoach route in 184 samuel williams tax assessor for north middleton prepared a list of taverns their pro prietors and the amount of tax they were sulphur spring house david cornman $150  vll 01 0120 14 north middleton code mountain house benjamin kutz $1  nort h middleton inn george swigart $080  waggoners gap hou se abraham waggoner  $1  and middlesex house john wonderlich  $1 presently there are only three public bars or taverns in north middleton township   the garden cave about half a mile north of carl isle on the carlisle springs road  the fireside inn just west of carlisle on the newville road  and the 720 club on north hanover street in addition there is the private yfw on the trind le road changed too is the revenue realized by the township from these establishmen ts whereas the total annua l tax for the five inns in 1841 was $530 the income from liquor licenses is now $800 public protection time constables and justices of the peace were the law enforcement in north middleton township until 1965 when william s weaver was appointed to work as a uniformed policeman for three years however keeping the peace remained a parttime proposition but the influx of new residents into the township gained such momentum that in 1968 the need was felt for a fulltime policeman  and weaver filled it presently the department consists of chief weaver one additiona l fulltime man mervin anderson  and four parttimer s to enable the men to cover the area two police cars are operated by the department fire protection was provided by an annual contract between the town ship and the union rural fire company of carlisle since there was a good deal of distance involved between many points in the township and the firehouse the citizens often had to rally and fight the fire themselves this was particularly true in the case of forest fires which occasiona lly flared up in the northern mountainou s area often these fires which were usuall y started by lightning burned for days and the men of the township would be called upon to scrape and dig fire lines until the blaze was under control within the memory of many current residents is one summer when two separate fires were burn ing in the north mountain at the same time again the increase in population demanded more protection than the tenuous arrangement with the union fire company afforded and the board of supervi sors first discussed buying their own fire apparatus in 1952 today the company has one tanker and one pumper and is raising funds to buy another even with the added protection the contract with the union is still renewed annually public improvements it s safe to say that the townships citizens began improvements almost as soon as they got down out of their wagon s the roads were cleared and bridges were built but for anything that we now think of as even crudely modern  the people had to wait until the turn of the twentieth century vlll 01  01  20 14 preface the first of the new conveniences to come to north middleton was the telephone about 1911 poles were erected wires were strung and 22 subscribers had the new little wonder in their hous es one of these was bill dewalt a current resident of the township whose family has lived in the area for more than 100 years count less children were sent across the fields to the neighbor s farm to summon someone for a phone call many small switcher lines or farmer lines went into busine ss and served the township for a while but the last of these the waggoners gap rural telephone company ended operations in 194 and the entire area is current ly being served by the united telephone company of pennsylvania then in 193 the township saw its first paved road west louther street extended  since that first twothousand fourhund redsixfoot stretch of hard road many more have been added providing easy access to all points in this bicentennial year of 197 only 12 mile of public dirt road remains a section of long s gap road extended electricity as it is now provided by the pennsylvania power and light company came in the late l 930s prior to that each farmer or other resident if he wanted electric lights had to maintain his own power plant this was a 32volt storage battery that needed to be constantly recharged by a gasoline generator as complicated as it sounds there were many of these private power sources in the township things that the township s citizens of 1976 take for granted without a second thought came into being during little over a decad e and a half that started with the first sidewalks on west louther street extended in 1945 zoning which now governs all new building and establishment of businesses was first men tioned at a supervisor s meeting in november 1948 things really got rolling in the 1950s with the first discussion of acquisition of property for a township shed 1953 voting machines 1954 plans for development of schlusser village 1954 and the first request for the first traffic light by the carlisle barrack s  1957 after seemingly interminable discussion the traffic signal was installed in 196 and city water and sewage were made available in 1962 residential building bas mushroomed in the township in the last 10 years roughly doubling the population until it seems a far cry from the same gentle fann land that in 1937 built and burned the last limestack in cumberland county requiring 144 fourhorse wagon loads of limestone in the process ix 01  012014 north middleton code recreation the people of carlisle have from the beginning of the town looked for ways to relax and enjoy themselves as often as not the direction in which theyve looked is that of north middleton township w11en the area was first established of course the streams and mountains to the north provided fish and game for both food and sport almost every kind of wildlife imaginable from beavers to elk and buffalo inhabited the township in its early days the conodoguinet was full of fish every spring shad ran up the creek to spawn and suckers were taken by the hundreds but with the onslaught of civilization  many of the species quickly disappeared  although as late as 1966 bobcats were still occasionally reported in the north mountain  still every october crowds are thrilled by the derringdo acrobatics of migrating hawks along the flyway at the top of waggoner s gap organization came to recreation with the carlisle sulphur springs hotel in 1830 that grew to a 200 room extravaganza by the time fire destroyed it in 1867 many of the young countrys wealthy sons made a stay at this plush spa and cave hill was rapidly becoming a favorite gathering spot of the townspeople ladies would be driven out on a warm summer afternoon to take tea with their friends in the cool mouth of the cave boating swimming and ice skating also brought crowds according to the season in the 1890s a trolley run was established to cave hill that made the round trip every half hour acceptance was so good that bellaire park and a dance pavilion were built to entice even more people to the area even after the demise of the trolley in the 1920s cave hill continued to be a favorite for a long time another busy spot on the creek was meadowbrook there also were a park and pavilion and in addition this area even had a very popular roller skating rink currently there are many casual activities enjoyed such as hunting fishing horseback riding boating snowmobiling and just plain hiking and in support of that are two townshipmaintained recreation areas one on waggoner s gap road and the other on fem avenue x 01012014 preface preface the town ship of no11h middleton has over the years passed process of legislative change common to many amer ican com munities wh ile only a few simple jaws were necessary at the time of the establishment of the township subsequent growth of the community together with the complexity of modem life has created the need for new and more detailed legislation for the proper function and government of the township the recording of local law is an aspect of mun icipal history and as the community develops and changes review and revision of old laws and consideration of new laws in the light of current trends must keep pace the orderly collec tion of these records is an important step in this evercontinuing process legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records it must be availa ble and logically arranged for convenient use and must be kept uptodate it was with thoughts such as these in mind that the board of supervisors ordered the following codification of the townships legislation contents of various chapters of the all currently effective legislation of a genera l and per manent nature enacted by the board of supervisors of the township of north middleton includ ing revisions or amendments to existing legislation deemed necessary by the board of supervi sors in the course of the codification division of divided into part s administrative legislation contains all township legisla tion of an administrative nature namely that dealing w ith the administration of government that establishing or regulating municipal departments and that affecting officers and employees of the municipal government and its departments general legislation contains all other town ship legislation of a regulatory nature items of legislation in this par t generally impose penalties for violation of their prov isions whereas those in do not table of contents and grouping of legislation the table of contents details the arrangement of material alphabetically by chapter as a mean s of identifying specific areas of legislation wherever two or more items of legislation have been combined by the editor into a single chapter the use of art icle designations has preserved the identity of the individual enactments and the titles of the articles are listed beneath the chapter title in order to facilitate location of the individual enactments x l 01  01  2014 north middleton code reserved chapters unassigned chapter numbers do not appear in the table of contents but are available for assign ment to new enactments in this manner new subject matter can be included alphabetically  pagination a unique pagenumb ering system has been used in which each chapter forms an autonomous unit the first page of each chapter is the number of that chapter followed by a colon and the nu meral

while the sixth section of would be  576 scheme  the scheme is the list of section titles that precede s the text of each chapter these titles are care fully written so that taken together they may be considered as a summary of the content of the chapter taken separately each describes the content of a particu lar section for ease and preci sion of reference the scheme titles are repeated as
