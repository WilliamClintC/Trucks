46196 the applicant for service shall pay an amount equivalent to the assessment this amount shall then be refunded pro rata to all contributors along the extension whose remaining contribution still exceeds what would have been assessed under section 46196 4 when refunds have reduced the contribution of any contributor to the applicable assessment per front foot no further refund will be made to that individual after all refunds have been made the remaining premises that may connect will be charged at the rate per front foot established for the extension 5 all refunds pertaining to connection charges collected by the city shall be paid to the applicant or his assigns or heirs unless specifically provided otherwise in writing 6 when an extension beyond an existing extension is required to serve a new customer and the cost for a customer exceeds the average remaining contribution in the original extension then the new extension will be considered as an entirely new project without refunds or any other connection to the original extension 7 when customers connect to a sanitary sewer main laid at city expense there shall be a contribution of an amount equivalent to the applicable
