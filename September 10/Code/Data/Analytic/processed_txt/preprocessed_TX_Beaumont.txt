sexually oriented businesses division 1 generally findings a purpose it is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote public health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations the provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material b findings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult sexually oriented businesses on the community presented in hearings and workshops and in reports made available to the council and on studies in other communities including but not limited to phoenix arizona  minneapolis minnesota  houston texas  indianapolis indiana  amarillo texas  garden grove california  los angeles california  whittier california  austin texas  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  and cleveland ohio the council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses may lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that presently are sometimes uncontrolled by the managers of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for certain activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this article as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex may easily occur at sexually oriented businesses which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which may create unhealthy conditions 5 many communicable diseases may be spread by activities which may occur in sexually oriented businesses 6 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 7 the findings noted in subsections 1 6 raise substantial governmental concerns 8 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 9 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the managers of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the managers to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city 10 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity which may occur in such booths 11 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 12 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses may aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 13 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 14 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business or sexually oriented business employee license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article    51376 15 the barring of such individuals from the management of or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 16 the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article 17 sexually oriented businesses can exert negative influences on churches schools and day care centers and have negative effects on property values can contribute to increased criminal activities in surrounding areas and can exert the same types of negative community influences on other forms of land usage such as public buildings and parks that were not previously addressed in the prior ordinance 18 the offenses listed under specified criminal activity which may serve as grounds for denial revocation or refusal of a license under this article are offenses which relate to or bear on the management or operation of a sexually oriented business or employment in a sexually oriented business the specified criminal activity offenses would also be directly related to the fitness of an individual to receive a license as a sexually oriented business employee accordingly the specified criminal activity offenses are directly related to the duties and the responsibilities which may be authorized by a license issued under this article accordingly there is a serious need to protect members of the public and fellow employees of sexually oriented business enterprises from persons who have committed the specified criminal activity offenses outlined in this article 19 persons who hold or apply for sexually oriented business or business employee licenses under this article should be subject to a verification that they have not either pled guilty or been convicted of any of the offenses noted under the definition for specified criminal activity 20 the provisions of the prior ordinance were insufficient regarding booths to properly address the issues associated with casual sexual activity that may facilitate the spread of sexually transmitted diseases criminal activities including lewd conduct indecent exposure etc or other activities detrimental to the health safety and welfare of the public and therefore determines that there is a need to provide for the monitoring of activities in facilities which offer either live entertainment or films movies videocassettes video reproductions video laser discs slides or other visual representations which are characterized by the depiction or description of specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas and therefore provides in this article provisions requiring that areas where such activities occur be fully visible to and monitored by management employees of such sexually oriented businesses to ensure that the activities in the building are in compliance with the provisions of this article 21 instituting distance requirements as they address the location of sexually oriented businesses or the conduct of licensed employees is reasonable and necessary to provide protection to the community from the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented business and may be done without depriving such businesses of adequate opportunities to locate within the city or licensed employees from engaging in protected activities 22 the city council finds that the provisions of this article as they relate to signage requirements are proper subjects for city control and that the failure to control signage related to sexually oriented businesses may have a negative secondary effect on the community that the signage requirements would serve to reduce the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses upon the community that the signage requirements would not deprive such businesses of adequate opportunity to provide notice to the public of their location and business and that the requirement would further act to protect the health safety and welfare of the public

disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage secs 1 2 adopted   1978 sec 626 of purpose a it is the

element as approved by the city and on file in the office of the city clerk and in accordance with the following provisions 1 neighborhood unit concept it is intended that the urban area shall be designed as a group of integrated residential neighborhoods with appropriate activity centers and corridors and industrial areas the following design principles are central to the neighborhood unit concept a arterial streets are routed around the perimeter of the neighborhood b collector streets should disperse local traffic to arterial streets without bisecting the neighborhood collector streets should be designed so as to discourage their use as crosstown arterial streets c children can walk to school and play areas ways or open space corridors separated from streets and the hazards of moving automobiles d residential streets should provide good access to residential units but should be planned so that they will not be used as traffic routes culdesacs curved street layouts and lightduty surfacing should be used to promote low traffic volumes and preservation of residential character e the elementary school and neighborhood park and playground should be located in the center of the residential area while major streets are routed along the perimeter each family should be within onehalf mile of the neighborhood center f public buildings and multifamily dwellings are located so as to form a buffer between the more intense activity of the shopping center and the quiet atmosphere of the singlefamily residential areas g the neighborhood shopping center is located on arterial streets this gives good access both from within and outside of the neighborhood residents of other areas can reach the shopping center without traveling neighborhood 2 physical conditions the arrangement of lots and blocks and the street system should be designed to make the most advantageous use of topography and natural physical features tree masses and large individual trees should be
