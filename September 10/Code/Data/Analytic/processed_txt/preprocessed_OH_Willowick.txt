property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city of willowick bthis regulation requires owners who develop or redevelop their property within the city to 1control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all stormwater control measures scms are properly designed constructed and maintained 2reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may be caused by new development or redevelopment activities 3control the volume rate and quality of stormwater runoff originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased 4minimize the need to construct repair and replace subsurface storm drain systems 5preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources except in slippage prone soils 6incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process 7reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems caused by inadequate stormwater
