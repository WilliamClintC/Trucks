no building site may include any land defined as unsuitable for development by the provisions of subsection 4 above 4 evaluation criteria in evaluating the layout of lots and open space the following criteria will be considered by the planning commission as indicating design appropriate to the sites natural historic and cultural features and meeting the purposes of these regulations diversity and originality in lot layout shall be encouraged to achieve the best possible relationship between development and conservation areas accordingly the planning commission shall evaluate proposals to determine whether the proposed plan 1 protects and preserves all floodplains wetlands and steep slopes from clearing grading filling or construction except as may be approved by the city for essential infrastructure or active or passive recreation amenities 2 preserves and maintains mature woodlands existing fields pastures meadows and orchards and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses for example locating house lots and driveways within wooded areas is generally recommended with two exceptions the first involves significant wildlife habitat or mature woodlands that raise an equal or greater preservation concern as described in items no subsections 5 and no 8 below the second involves predominantly agricultural areas where remnant tree groups provide the only natural areas for wildlife habitat 3 if development must be located on open fields or pastures because of greater constraints in all other parts of the site dwellings should be sited on the least prime agricultural soils or in locations at the far edge of a field as seen from existing public roads other considerations include whether the development will be visually buffered from existing public roads such as by a planting screen consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees shrubs and wildflowers specifications for which should be based upon a close examination of the distribution and frequency of those species found in a typical nearby roadside verge or hedgerow 4 maintains andor creates watershed and drainageway buffers of natural native species vegetation adjacent to wetlands and surface waters including creeks streams springs lakes and ponds as follows a 100footwide watershed buffers shall be created andor maintained around bodies of water supply impoundments measured perpendicular to the shoreline of the water supply impoundment watershed buffers shall extend 100 feet from the flood pool elevation of the water supply impoundment inside the watershed draining to the impoundment b 50footwide watershed buffers shall be created andor maintained around water impoundments other than water supply impoundments with a drainage area of 25 or more acres watershed buffers shall be measured perpendicular to the shoreline and shall extend 50 feet from the normal pool elevation of the water impoundment inside the watershed draining into that impoundment c 30footwide watershed buffers shall be created andor maintained around water impoundments draining at least five acres but less than 25 acres buffers shall be measured perpendicular to the shoreline and shall extend 30 feet from the normal pool elevation of the water impoundment inside the watershed draining into that impoundment d drainageway buffers shall be created andor maintained on each side of a stream that is shown as a perennial stream on the most recent version of the usgs 000 75 minute scale topographic maps or has a drainage area of 40 or more acres the width of the drainageway buffer shall be a minimum of 50 feet wide for flat lying areas the drainageway buffer shall be increased two feet in width for every one percent of slope increase measured along a line perpendicular to the stream bank e drainageway buffers shall be created andor maintained along each side of a watercourse channel ditch or similar physiographic feature the width of said buffer shall be determined as follows i 30 feet in width if the area of the watercourse channel ditch or similar physiographic feature is at least 25 acres but less than 40 acres ii the drainageway buffer shall be a minimum of 25 feet wide if the drainage area of the watercourse channel ditch or similar physiographic feature is at least five acres but less than 25 acres 5 designs around existing hedgerows and treelines between fields or meadows and minimizes impacts on large woodlands greater than five acres especially those containing many mature trees or a significant wildlife habitat or those not degraded by invasive plants also woodlands of any size on highly erodible soils with slopes greater than ten percent should be avoided however woodlands in poor condition with limited management potential can provide suitable locations for residential development when any woodland is developed great care shall be taken to design all disturbed areas for building roads yards septic disposal fields etc in locations where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas to the fullest extent that is practicable 6 leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted particularly as seen from public thoroughfares for example in open agrarian landscapes a deep nobuild noplant buffer is recommended along the public thoroughfare where those views or vistas are prominent or locally significant the concept of foreground meadows with homes facing the public thoroughfare across a broad grassy expanse as illustrated in figure 55 of conservation design for subdivisions a practical guide to creating open space networks is strongly preferred to mere buffer strips with or without berms or vegetative screening in wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained a deep nobuild nocut buffer should be respected to preserve existing vegetation 7 protects wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered threatened or of special concern by the us environmental protection agency or the tennessee department of environment and conservation 8 designs around and preserves sites of historic archaeological or cultural value and their environs insofar as needed to safeguard the character of the feature including stone walls spring houses barn foundations cellar holes earthworks and burial grounds 9 protects rural roadside character and improves public safety and vehicular carrying capacity by avoiding development fronting directly onto existing public roads establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridor of rural roads with historic buildings stone walls hedgerows etc 10 landscapes common areas such as community greens culdesac islands and both sides of new streets with native specie shade trees and flowering shrubs with high wildlife conservation value these trees shall generally be located between the sidewalk or footpath and the edge of the street within a planting strip not less than five feet in width 11 provides active recreational areas in suitable locations that offer convenient access by residents and adequate screening from nearby house lots 12 includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site between properties and activities or special features within the neighborhood open space system all roadside footpaths should connect with offroad trails which in turn should link with potential open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels or with existing open space on adjoining developed parcels where applicable 13 provides open space that is reasonably contiguous and whose configuration is in accordance with the guidelines contained in the design and management handbook for preservation areas produced by the natural lands trust to the greatest extent practicable this land shall be designed as a single block with logical straightforward boundaries long thin strips of conservation land shall be avoided unless the conservation feature is linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other streams or trails the open space shall generally abut existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels such as in other subdivisions public parks or properties owned by or leased to private land conservation organizations such subdivision open space shall be designed as part of large contiguous and integrated greenway systems as per the policies in the open space recreation and environmental resources element of the citys comprehensive plan

commercial district regulations purposes of commercial districts 61011 general purposes the commercial districts established by this ordinance are designed to promote and protect the health safety morals convenience order prosperity and other aspects of the general welfare these goals include among others the following 1 to provide sufficient space in appropriate locations in proximity to established residential areas for local retail and service trades catering specifically to the recurring shopping needs of the occupants of nearby residences 2 to protect both retail and service developments and nearby residences against fire explosions toxic and noxious matter radiation and other hazards and against offensive noise vibration smoke dust and other particulate matter odorous matter heat humidity glare and other objectionable influences 3 to protect both retail and service developments and nearby residences against congestion by regulating the intensity of retail and service developments consistent with their marketing functions by restricting those types of establishments which generate heavy traffic and by providing for offstreet parking and loading facilities 4 to provide sufficient and appropriate space and in particular sufficient area to meet the areas expected future need for modern planned commercial floor space including the need for offstreet parking space in areas where a large proportion of customers come by automobile and to encourage the tendency of commercial establishments to concentrate in integrated planned developments to the mutual advantage of both consumers and merchants 5 to provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for commercial districts to satisfy specific functional needs of the area and in particular the need for medical services and the needs of the general public traveling along major thoroughfares 6 to provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for the mixture of compatible residential and restricted commercial developments where standards for development will provide protection for the environmental essentials of either 7 to provide appropriate locations for transitional uses intervening between commercial developments and residential areas and thereby alleviate the friction inherent between dissimilar activities 8 to provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for all types of commercial and miscellaneous service activities 9 to provide freedom of architectural design in order to encourage the development of more attractive efficient and economic building forms within appropriate standards which ensure that buildings are in character with their surroundings 10 to promote the most desirable use of land and direction of building development in accord with a well considered plan to promote stability of commercial development to strengthen the economic base of the area to protect the character of the districts and their peculiar suitability for particular uses to conserve the value of land and buildings 61012 specific purposes 1 cg commercialgeneral districts this district is designed to provide for a wide range of commercial uses concerned with retail trade and consumer services  amusement and entertainment establishments  automotive and vehicular service establishments  transient sleeping accommodations  drivein stores  eating and drinking places

permit uses which generate large volumes of truck traffic community facilities and utilities necessary to serve these districts or necessary for the general community welfare are also permitted appropriate open space between commercial and residential areas is required this classification is intended to recognize an existing undesirable development pattern but not repeat or significantly expand the pattern beyond those areas where such is already established 2 ci commercial interchange districts this district is designed to provide adequate space at major freeway interchanges for uses which serve the needs of the motoring public automobile and other vehicular service establishments transient sleeping accommodations and eating and drinking establishments primarily characterize this district in addition commercial trade and service uses are permitted if necessary to serve the recurring needs of persons frequenting these districts community facilities and utilities necessary to serve these districts or necessary for the general community welfare are also permitted bulk limitations required of uses in these districts in part are designed to maximize building in proximate residential districts appropriate locations for this district are near major transportation interchanges in clustered development patterns and not patterns of striped commercial development extending in a continuous manner along major traffic arteries 3 cmu commercial mixed use districts these districts are designed primarily to provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for establishments and uses engaged in general retail restaurant professional offices commercial services residential dwellings and services ancillary thereto as these districts tend to generate relatively large volumes of vehicular traffic and may have other characteristics detrimental to residential environments their locations are most suitable on properties with sufficient frontage on arterial streets where these districts must necessarily abut existing or proposed residential areas external to the development efforts to minimize incompatibility shall be made by providing appropriate buffers and site design in addition a selection of community facilities and utilities considered necessary to service the principal uses in these districts or necessary for the general community welfare are permitted mixeduse developments may be permitted planned unit development process as described in section 8207 of this zoning cns convenience neighborhood service districts these districts are intended to provide locations for retail and personal service operations serving a limited market area and engaged in the retail sale of goods andor services from the site of frequently and recurrently needed items for personal consumption or household use the permitted establishments are those which provide for regular local shopping and which therefore are visited frequently by customers community facilities and utilities necessary to serve these districts or necessary for the general community welfare are also permitted these districts may occur along and at the intersection of arterial and community collector streets characteristically are small and are widely distributed throughout the community for convenient accessibility it is expressly intended that these districts be limited in gross land area and building bulk so as to maintain compatibility with the surrounding residential environment the bulk regulations are established to provide for maximum compatibility between the commercial activity in these districts and adjacent residential activity the establishment of a new district of this nature must be preceded by the development of residential areas capable of supporting the proposed activities 5 ops officeprofessional service districts these districts are designed to provide for transitional uses between more intensive commercial activities occurring along major traffic arteries and residential areas the permitted uses are ones which tend to produce relatively low volumes of traffic in addition to the office activities certain community facilities are permitted which are compatible with other uses permitted within these districts the intensity of use and building bulk permitted within these districts is controlled by more restrictive regulation consistent with their intended transitional function 6 ctc commercial town center districts this district is designed to provide for a wide range of commercial uses concerned with retail trade and consumer services

industrial districts established by this ordinance are designed to promote and protect the health safety morals convenience order prosperity and other aspects of the general welfare these goals include among others the following 1 to provide sufficient space in appropriate locations to meet the needs of the area for all types of distributive industrial and related activities with due allowance for the need for choice of suitable sites 2 to protect distributive industrial and related activities as well as residential and related activities by providing for separation of these uses and as far as possible provide that appropriate space needs for distributive and industrial activities are available by prohibiting the use of such space for residential purposes 3 to encourage industrial development which is free from danger of fire explosions toxic or noxious matter radiation smoke dust or other particulate matter and other hazards and from offensive noise vibration odorous matter heat humidity glare and other objectionable influences by permitting such development in areas where this ordinance restricts the emission of such nuisances without regard to the industrial products and processes involved 4 to protect adjacent residential and commercial areas and to protect the labor force in other establishments engaged in less offensive types of industrial and related activities by restricting those industrial activities which involve danger of fire explosions toxic or noxious matter radiation smoke dust or other particulate matter and other hazards or create offensive noise vibration heat humidity glare and other objectionable influences by permitting such development in areas where this ordinance restricts the emission of such nuisances without regard to the industrial products or processes involved 5 to protect industrial activities and related developments against congestion as far as is possible and appropriate in each area by limiting the bulk of buildings in relation to the land around them and to one another and by requiring space off public ways for parking and loading facilities associated with such activities 6 to promote the most desirable use of land and direction of building development to promote stability of industrial and related development to strengthen the economic base of the area to protect the character of these districts and their peculiar suitability for particular uses to conserve the value of land and buildings and to protect the citys tax revenues 7 to protect adjacent residential and commercial districts from any negative impacts attributable to sites devoted to industrial activities 71012 specific purposes 1 ir restrictive industrial districts this class of district is intended to provide space for a wide range of industrial and related uses that conform to a high level of performance criteria and have the least objectionable characteristics these districts may provide a buffer between other districts and other industrial activities that have more objectionable influences except as specified in article iii subsection 31052 subpart 6 residential occupancy in connection with nonresidential activity new residential activities are excluded and community facilities and commercial establishments which provide needed services for industry and are complementary thereto are permitted 2 ig general industrial districts this class of district is intended to provide space for the types of industrial activities which by reason of volume of raw materials or freight scale of operation type of structures required or other similar characteristics require locations relatively well segregated from nonindustrial uses except as specified in article iii subsection 31052 subpart

each other to protect the uses from the traffic noise glare trash activity vibration odor visual disorder and other harmful or noxious effects likely to be emitted by or associated with a more intensive use transitional protective yard regulations are also required to prevent adverse community appearance to protect the character of the area to conserve the values of buildings and land and to provide adequate light and air transitional protective yards of differing depths and widths are required depending upon the combination of uses and the adverse effects which the uses have 101112 location and extent of protective yards transitional protective yards are measured from the property line of the property to be screened to vehicular surface areas buildings the loading display storage and service areas no transitional screening shall be required in street yards provided in accordance with the provisions of section 10112 street yard landscape regulations transitional protective yards may overlap other yard areas but yard areas used as transitional protective yards must comply with the requirements of this section nothing contained in this section shall reduce the minimum requirements of any other yards required by this ordinance whenever two or more transitional yards are simultaneously applicable as for example a property which contains two or more uses then the more stringent regulation is controlling if two or more different uses are present on one lot only those uses which constitute ten percent or more of the gross floor area of the building or land area shall be considered 101113 planting materials 1 trees all deciduous trees which are planted to meet the minimum requirements of this section shall be a minimum height of eight feet in height and

screening in the easement the required plantings shall be installed in the same number as otherwise required in the portion of the transitional protective yard remaining after exclusion of the easement area see subsection 101084 5 modifications and alternatives the height and quantity of required planting materials and fencing in areas immediately contiguous to street yards required by section 10112 may be modified as an alternate method authorized by section 10107 when such screening will not serve any useful purpose due to the location of uses vehicles buildings structures storage loading display or service areas or when such screening will obstruct traffic visibility 101114 determination of transitional protective yard requirements generally a transitional protective yard shall be located at the perimeter of the building site along zoning district boundaries or otherwise coincident with the edge of a specified facility that is to be screened and shall not be located within in any portion of the public rightofway the following procedure shall be followed to determine the standard of transitional protective yard required along a zoning district boundary step a determine the zone district for the proposed development site as well as that of the abutting sites step b determine the transitional protective yard standard required for each building site boundary or portion thereof by referring to table 101114 read down the column beneath the zone district of the proposed site development and across the row which listed the zone district of the abutting site the letter in the grid square where the column and the row intersect is the required standard for the transitional protective yard step c select one widthscreening option from the appropriate group among those listed in figures 101114a d any of the listed screening variations shown on the appropriate figure shall satisfy the requirement between the abutting zone districts ex a1 a2 or a3 may be used to meet the requirements for an a standard transitional protective yard step d when calculating required numbers of plant materials round all fractions to the next whole number calculation of required plants for a c3 transitional protective yard for 275foot frontage required canopy trees 275100 x 6   275 x 6   165 round up to 17 canopy trees required understory trees 275100 x 3   275 x 3   825 round up to 9 understory trees required shrubs 275100 x 24   66 shrubs 101115 existing vegetation 1 credit for existing vegetation so long as the required level of visual barrier is provided by the resulting transitional protective yard existing vegetation which meets or exceeds the quantity spacing and height standards may be used to satisfy the requirements of subsection 101113 provided however no encroachments shall occur within the greater of either a sevenfoot radius or one foot in diameter for each inch of circumference of the existing tree and that the provisions of subsection 101126 are met 2 reduction of required plantings the amount of required shrubs in a transitional protective yard may be reduced by 50 percent if in that yard existing trees meeting the space quantity and specification requirements of subsection 101113 are preserved and protected from encroachment and the reduced number of shrubs still meets the intent of this ordinance for screening at the level of the groundplane 3 supplemental plantings supplemental natural evergreen shrub plantings may be required however if it can be reasonably inferred that after five years the existing vegetation will not continually provide a yearround foliage screen between properties from the natural grade to six feet above grade where such supplemental shrub plantings are required the plantings shall have a minimum height of 112 feet when installed with an expected height of six feet or greater within five years after planting and shall be planted so that there are no horizontal gaps greater than ten feet between shrubs as measured along the property lines where the existing vegetation on site does not meet the established criteria for spacing quantity and size of plant then the owner shall be required to plant only those trees and shrubs necessary to meet the established standards for the transitional protective yard required for the specific situation all plants used for this purpose shall meet the standards set out in subsection 101113 101116 fences walls and earthen berms 1 installation of closed fence or solid wall a fence or solid wall may be used as the sole means to meet the

developed residentially or zoned for any residential use exceeds 20 percent of the lot area 2 height requirements see subsection 101081 subpart subparagraph 1 materials and construction standards for standards of construction and appearance of fences 3 width of transitional protective yards with closed fences and solid walls if a fence or wall is erected pursuant to subpart 1 of this section the width of the transitional protective yard may be reduced to onehalf the required width 4 grade changes of six feet or more whenever a wall or fence is authorized to be constructed in lieu of such construction a natural or manmade grade separation at least six feet in elevation may be substituted  provided that the side slopes of such grade are not greater than  the developing property is located at an elevation lower than the properties to be screened and the change in grade achieves a similar screening effect as the wall or fence 5 earthen berms any earthen berm installed in a transitional protective yard which reduces the width of the transitional yard shall be constructed to meet the standards set out in subsection 101082 and shall be planted in accordance with the provisions of subsection 101113 a steeper slope than that specified in subsection 101082 may be used in exceptional cases when all the following are met a the steeper slope is sufficiently stabilized  b the screening objectives of subsection 101113 are better achieved  and c physical constraints of the site prevent the use of a flatter slope  10111 street yard landscape regulations 101121 intent it is the intent of this section to establish a landscape planting area parallel to the recorded public street rightofway this area shall contain plantings of trees and other live vegetation to provide a more pleasing view from the ways of travel to provide continuity of vegetation throughout the city to reduce the amount of impervious surface and reduce stormwater runoff to filter air provide shade

objectives presented above the following general policy statements shall apply 1 each project evaluation will determine the nature and extent of stormwater management practices that are necessary to adequately serve the property and limit impacts to downstream public and private properties the presence of lid a decentralized and a regional facility will be considered in determining the extent to which management practices will be necessary 2 a system of uniform requirements shall be applied to each individual project site in general these uniform requirements will be based on the criterion that postdevelopment stormwater peak runoff and water quality and volume impact shall not exceed predevelopment conditions 3 no construction whether by private or public action shall be performed in a manner that will negatively impact stormwater quantity or quality in its vicinity or in other areas whether by flow restrictions increased runoff or by diminishing channel or overbank storage capacity 4 new construction may not aggravate upstream or downstream flooding existing downstream or upstream problems may be required to be corrected in conjunction with new development 5 unwarranted acceleration of erosion due to various land development activities shall be controlled to the maximum extent possible andor practical 6 new construction shall not be permitted until temporary or permanent erosion prevention and sedimentation control management practices have been placed or constructed and are operational to the city of mt juliets satisfaction mt juliet reserves the right to stop construction on properties that do not have adequate erosion prevention and sedimentation control measures the erosion and sediment control handbook most current edition as published by the state of tennessee department of environment and conservation shall provide guidelines for minimum standards for site management of erosion and sedimentation and may be supplemented by policy of the city of mt juliet 7 new development will be required to minimize impact to stormwater quality by applying structural andor nonstructural management practices selected to address sitespecific conditions 8 mt juliet reserves the right to require more stringent erosion prevention and sedimentation control practices on properties within sensitive or impaired watersheds proximate to waters of the state or on sites that fail to mitigate ongoing issues 9 mt juliet reserves the rights to require maintenance or modification of stormwater management practices that are not operating properly as determined by the department of public works 10 for properties where stormwater management practices are not feasible or are not necessary due to the presence of regional stormwater management systems proximity to a receiving stream or other determining circumstances mt juliet reserves the right to require onsite controls for stormwater quality 11 redevelopment of properties with or without containing onsite stormwater management practices may be permitted by mt juliet provided the property and downstream public and private properties infrastructure or waters of the state are adequately protected by a regional facility from stormwater quantity or quality impacts 12 land disturbance activities shall not be permitted within the floodway construction in floodplains if permitted shall be done in a way that protects or enhances stormwater quality and promotes land and tree conservation greenways floodplains preservation and hazard mitigation 13 mt juliet reserves the right to require a tdec level 1

practices at a specific construction site 14 the minimum diameter for all storm drains shall be 15 inches cross drains andor pipes within a public rightofway shall be a minimum of 18 inches amend of 722014 stormwater management systems for the purposes of these regulations stormwater management systems are considered to comprise two parts the major and minor systems a brief description of these two parts is presented below  minor systems the minor system of a stormwater management network is sometimes termed the initial system and may consist of a variety of stormwater management appurtenances ranging from inlets manholes street gutters roadside ditches and swales to small channels or pipes rain gardens bioswales and other lid applications this system collects and may treat the initial stormwater runoff and conveys it to the major system  major systems the major system primarily consists of natural waterways waters of the state large storm sewers major culverts bridges and large water impoundments lid systems manmade wetlands and cisterns but it can also include less obvious flow paths such as overland relief swales and infrequent floodplain storage the major system includes not only the trunk line conveyance that receives the water from the minor system but also the natural flow path that functions in case of overflow from or failure of the minor system properly designed overflow relief shall not flood or damage homes businesses or other property it must always be remembered that the major system is needed for small medium and large flood events eventually it will fill with water and flow whether or not it has been planned and designed and whether or not development is situated wisely with respect to it amend of 722014 stormwater quantity and quality management increased urbanization within the city of mt juliet has caused radical changes to the topography ground cover and minor stormwater management systems within each drainage basin these changes have adverse effects on the environment primarily subsequent increase in stormwater runoff quantity and nonpoint source pollution which impacts stormwater quality in some areas the combination of increased runoff and the location of property near a stream causes frequent flooding often several times per year in these areas upstream control of frequent as well as large flows may not provide adequate flood protection for residents and property downstream to minimize adverse stormwater quantity and quality impacts onsite volume management of stormwater is mandatory for all developments that are not served by an adequately sized regional stormwater management facility subject to review by the city of mt juliet because volume management in downstream areas of a large watershed can cause increase peak flows in downstream channels the city of mt juliet reserves the right to alter the volume management criteria and to prohibit it where it would cause adverse impacts this decision shall be based on sound engineering judgment along with supporting data and studies nevertheless in all cases where volume management facilities are required the location and design must comply with any stormwater master plans that may have been adopted quality design storm first flush twoyear 15 minutes15minute storm per metro nashville intensity duration curve this policy is primarily concerned with maintaining predevelopment conditions for stormwater quality flood storage flow volume and velocity  it should also be applied under certain conditions for the purpose of maintaining adequate capacity of an existing outfall or combining public and private efforts to correct existing deficiencies for flooding erosion and stormwater quality in some cases controlling the total volume of runoff to predevelopment levels may also be required amend of 722014 stormwater quality management practices increased pollutant concentrations and loads impact the ability of the major systems and waters of the state to meet designated use goals in many cases the designated use goal for creeks and streams in mt juliet are fishability and swimability to minimize these stormwater quality impacts onsite stormwater quality management practices during construction and post construction are mandatory for all developments subject to review by the city of mt juliet the extent and type of management practices implemented must be proportionate to the land use pollutant discharge potential mt juliet encourages that a series of best management practices be implemented that optimize the use of required green and open spaces especially along buildings and within or along parking lots the stormwater controls shall be designed to achieve removal of 80 percent of total suspended solids tss and removal of oil and grease best management practicesbmpsshall include but not be limited to  the use of onsite landscaping and vegetation to enhance water quality treatment  the use of proprietary devices in combination with primary or secondary bmps that provide at least 80 percent reduction in total suspended solids tss and removal of oil and grease with no bypass at peak system

leaving the site to predevelopment levels use of appropriate stormwater quality best management practices determination of the size and capacity of an adequate stormwater management system shall take into account the future development in the watershed or affected portions thereof the design must not adversely affect adjacent or neighboring properties it is the responsibility of the developer or property owner to pick up or acceptably handle the quantity of runoff as it flows onto their property from the watershed above and conduct it property to an adequate outfall at the lower property line or beyond the outfall must be sufficient to receive the runoff without deterioration of the downstream channel the stormwater management system for new developments shall be designed to enhance stormwater quality for runoff or a portion thereof entering the property from the above watershed new developments and areas of significant redevelopment are required to control stormwater quality for runoff from their site per the requirements of section 15 stormwater quality management practices to predevelopment levels use of best management practice if it is not feasible to implement an onsite stormwater quality best management practices then the developer may with approval from the director of public works design a system that controls quality for an equivalent portion of runoff entering

preceding item more precise hydrologic and hydraulic computations are required the minor system overland relief swales or surface storage should be designed so that flooding will damage no building 6 in general the minor stormwater management system should not be oversized as a basis for providing major system capacity the major stormwater management system should be in the form of area grading or the location and construction of buildings in such a manner that overland relief swales or surface storage will provide adequate flood protection the major stormwater management system should be

work order rescind a land disturbance permit or take other appropriate legal action see section 21 of these regulations amend of 722014 gutter and inlet hydraulics a synopsis the level of service of facilities that provide drainage of roadway surfaces should be consistent with the level of service of the roadway guidelines are given for evaluating roadway features and design criteria as they relate to gutter and inlet hydraulics procedures for performing gutter flow calculations are based on a modification of mannings equation inlet capacity calculations for grated and combination inlets are based on information contained in hec12 usdot fhwa 1984 city of mt juliet specific design information is presented for typical details contained in the standard drawings of the city of mt juliet public works department b design criteria the following design criteria are typically important for gutter and inlet capacity calculations 1 return period 2 spread 3 inlet types and spacing 4 mannings n values 5 grade 6 cross slope 7 curb and gutter sections 8 roadside and median ditches 9 bridge decks c return period the design storm return period for pavement drainage should be consistent with the frequency selected for other components of the drainage system d spread for multilaned curb and gutter or guttered roadways with no parking it is not practical to avoid travel lane flooding when grades are flat 10 percent however flooding should never exceed the lane adjacent to the gutter or shoulder for design conditions standard practice in the city is to limit maximum stormwater spread to eight feet measured from the face of the curb municipal bridges with curb and gutter should also use this criterion for singlelane roadways at least eight feet of roadway should remain unflooded for design conditions e inlet types and spacing inlet types shall be selected from standard drawings dr105 dr110 and dr115 of the city public works department standard drawings set forth in appendix b inlets shall be located or spaced in such a manner that the design curb flow does not exceed the spread criterion of eight feet no flow will be allowed to cross intersecting streets unless approved by the city department of public works in addition curb and gutter inlets should not be built in curb returns f mannings n values mannings n values for various pavement surfaces are presented in the table in subsection l of this section g grade curb and gutter grades that are equal to pavement slopes shall not exceed 13 percent or fall below one percent without approval from the city department of public works a minimum longitudinal gradient is more important for curbed pavements which are susceptible to stormwater spread flat gradients on uncurbed pavements can lead to a spread problem if vegetation is allowed to build up along the pavement edge h cross slope the design of pavement cross slope is often a compromise between the need for reasonably steep cross slopes for drainage and relatively flat cross slopes for driver comfort in most city design situations cross slopes will be defined by the standard pavement sections given on standard drawings st101 st102 st105 st106 st108 st109 st111 and st112 of the city public works department standard drawings for streets and roads set forth in appendix b the standard city cross slope is a fourinch crown over the edge of the pavement when three or more lanes are inclined in the same direction on multilane pavements it is desirable for each successive pair of lanes or the portion thereof outward from the first two lanes from the crown line to have an increased slope the two lanes adjacent to the crown line should be pitched at the normal slope and successive lane pairs or portions thereof outward should be increased by about 05 to 10 percent where three or more lanes are provided in each direction the maximum pavement cross slope should be limited to four percent i curbs and gutter sections curbing at the outside edge of pavements is normal practice for lowspeed urban highway facilities curb and curb and gutter details are presented in standard drawings st200 st202 st203 and st204 of the city public works department standard drawings set forth in appendix b standard gutter width is as shown on the details gutters are on the same cross slope as the pavement on the high side and depressed with a steeper cross slope on the low side usually one inch per foot typical practice is to place curbs at the outside edge of shoulders or parking lanes on low speed facilities j roadside and median ditches roadside ditches are commonly used with uncurbed roadway sections to convey pavement runoff and up gradient area runoff that drains toward the pavement rightofway limitations prevent use of roadside ditches in densely developed urban areas they can be used in cut sections depressed sections and other locations where sufficient rightofway is available and driveways or intersections are infrequent curbed highway sections are relatively inefficient at conveying water and the area tributary to the gutter section should be kept to a minimum to reduce the hazard from water on the pavement where practicable the flow from major areas draining toward curbed highway pavements should be intercepted by ditches as appropriate it is preferable to slope median areas and inside shoulders to a center swale to prevent drainage from the median areas from running across the pavement this is particularly important for highspeed facilities and for facilities with more than two lanes of traffic in each direction k bridge decks drainage of bridge decks is similar to other curbed roadway sections it is often less efficient because cross slopes are flatter parapets collect large amounts of debris and small drainage inlets on scuppers have a higher potential for clogging by debris bridge deck constructability usually requires a constant cross slope so the guidelines in subsection h of this section do not apply because of the difficulties in providing and maintaining adequate deck drainage systems gutter flow from roadways should be intercepted before it reaches a bridge in many cases deck drainage must be carried several spans to the bridge and for disposal zero gradients and sag vertical curves should be avoided on bridges the minimum desirable grade for bridge deck drainage should be 10 percent when bridges are placed at a vertical curve and the grade is less than 10 percent the gutter spread should be checked to ensure a safe reasonable design scuppers are the recommended method of deck drainage because they can reduce the problems of transporting a relatively large concentration of runoff in an area of generally limited rightofway they also have a low initial cost and are relatively easy to maintain however the use of scuppers should be evaluated for sitespecific concerns scuppers should not be located over embankments slope pavements slope protection navigation channels driving lanes or railroad tracks runoff collected and transported to the end of the bridge should generally be collected by inlets and down drains although sod flumes may be used for extremely minor flows in some areas l gutter flow calculations the following form of mannings equation should be used to evaluate gutter flow hydraulics q   056 s 53 s 12 t83 51 n x where q   gutter
