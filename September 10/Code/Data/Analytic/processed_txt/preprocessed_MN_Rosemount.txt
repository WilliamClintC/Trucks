the developer shall be responsible for implementing the tree preservation plan prior to and during site grading and plan development the tree preservation plan will be reviewed by city staff to assess

significant tree removal  sterling codifiers inc  261324 a heritage trees heritage trees are unique trees to rosemount due to their size and age all possible measures will be taken to preserve these trees heritage trees removal may occur only when there is not a practical alternative such as the alignment of a collector or arterial street or the installation of a trunk utility corridor there is a zero percent 0% removal threshold on heritage trees meaning every caliper inch of heritage tree removed will require replacement in accordance with the standards of subsection e10 of this section b significant tree removal for developments although the applicant must retain the maximum amount of woodland possible the city recognizes that a certain amount of significant trees and tree cover removal is an inevitable consequence of the urban development process therefore twenty five percent 25% of the existing caliper inches of trees can be removed during development without obligation of replacement any removal beyond twenty five percent 25% will require replacement as described in subsection e10 of this section c significant tree removal for home and business owners the majority of tree removal occurs during the grading and installation of infrastructure during subdivision the city recognizes that additional tree removal may occur after subdivision to construct new houses or business or the expansion of existing homes or business but to a lesser degree than the original subdivision therefore ten percent 10% of the existing caliper inches of trees can be removed during home or business construction without obligation of replacement any removal beyond ten percent 10% will require replacement as described in subsection e10 of this section d trees exempt from replacement the following types of trees do not need to be included as part of the tally of tree removals 1 dead diseased or dying trees  or 2 trees that are transplanted from the site to another appropriate area within the city  or 3 trees that were planted as part of a commercial business such as a tree farm or nursery 9 financial guarantee refer to subsection g of this section 10 tree replacement formula replacement of removed or disturbed trees in excess of the percentage allowed by this subsection shall be according to the following guidelines a for development which exceeds the percentage of allowable removal of significant trees all significant trees shall be replaced at the ratio of onehalf 05 caliper inch per one caliper inch removed b for each heritage tree removed by the developer all heritage trees shall be replaced at the ratio of one caliper inch per onecaliper inch removed 11 size types and diversification of replacement trees replacement trees shall be of a similar species to those that are removed but also shall be a minimum of twenty five percent 25% conifers and twenty five percent 25% deciduous hardwoods required heritage tree replacement must be of the same species as the heritage tree removed replacement trees must be no less than the following sizes a deciduous trees shall be no less than two and onehalf 25 caliper inches  and b coniferous trees shall be no less than six feet 6 high 12 acceptable tree replacement species the following list of trees are acceptable for tree replacement species the city may at its discretion approve additional species if circumstances such as soil conditions hydrology topography or recent tree diseases warrant ash black cherry cedar fir hickory linden maple except silver maples oak pine spruce walnut 13 other replacement tree requirements choice of replacement trees species and location of the trees should also be contingent on the following information a soil composition comparisons should be made between soil conditions and the ecology of the proposed species to make sure they are compatible b spatial requirements the potential height and crown spread of the proposed replacement trees should be known usually half of the adult tree crown diameter is the amount of distance a tree should be planted from any aboveground objects c diseases and insect problems appropriate replacement choices shall also consider insect and disease problems that may be common with particular species in the part of the state in which the city of rosemount is located 14 fee in lieu of tree replacement or replacement trees planted in public areas the city recognizes that there may be instances where the total amount of tree replacement required cannot occur on site or that there are some land uses such as refining that are not compatible with trees in those instances the city mayat its option accept a fee in lieu of tree placement or allow the planting of replacement trees in public areas tree replacement is encouraged to happen on site as much as possible and fee in lieu of tree replacement should be used only when replacement cannot occur on site the fee in lieu of tree replacement will be determined annually by the city council city fee schedule f parking lot landscaping the need for internal parking lot landscaping will be subject to planning commission site review when such landscaping is required it will be to lessen the monotony heat and wind associated with large parking lots when the internal planting islands are required the island boundaries must be constructed
