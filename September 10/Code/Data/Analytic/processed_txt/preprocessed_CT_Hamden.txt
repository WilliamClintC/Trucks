village district regulations is to protect the unique character of spring glen which is a primarily residential neighborhood bounded to the north by the spring glen school on whitney avenue to the south by lake whitney to the west by the mill river and the north basin of lake whitney and to the east by the hartford turnpike and the north haven town line the spring glen village district sgvd extends along both sides of whitney avenue from walden street to glendower road the sgvd includes in their entirety every first and second property back from this part of whitney avenue in hamden on

several homes of historical significance on whitney avenue exhibiting colonial federal and greek revival design in the 20th century residential development was primarily in the colonial revival style and commercial architecture in the tudor revival style spring glen grew as a result of early suburbanization of the new haven area from the early 20th century s this growth was supported by public transportation on whitney avenue such as trolleys and resulted in small residential lot development around a village center this circular residential neighborhood with a small nodal business district on whitney avenue is one of the defining characteristics of the spring glen neighborhood the fact that the form and size of the spring glen business district have remained relatively constant and not spread down whitney avenue or encroached more deeply upon existing residential properties has helped define spring glen as a unique village and walkable neighborhood the spring glen business district has traditionally been the location of retail and service establishments serving the adjacent residential neighborhood no physical expansion of the existing business district in spring glen should be permitted as stated in the hamden plan of conservation and development 200  in addition to welldefined residential and commercial districts spring glen is home to several religious institutions private schools and a public school along whitney avenue within walking distance of any home in the neighborhood these institutions further define the sgvd of spring glen the conversion of these properties to higher density housing than permitted under r4 zoning regulations or commercial uses would negatively impact the village character diversity walkability and the public safety of

shall take into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances including but not limited to a the environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses  including the effects on the inland wetlands and watercourses capacity to support fish and wildlife to prevent flooding to supply and protect surface and ground waters to control sediment to facilitate drainage to control pollution to support recreational activities and to promote public health and safety  b the applicants purpose for and any feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no environmental impact to wetlands or watercourses  c the relationship between the short term and long term impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses and the maintenance and enhancement of longterm productivity of such wetlands or watercourses including consideration of the extent to which the proposed activity involves tradeoffs between shortterm environmental gains at the expense of longterm losses or vice versa and consideration of the extent to which the proposed action forecloses or predetermines future options  d irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources which would be caused by the proposed regulated activity including the extent to which such activity would foreclose a future ability to protect enhance or restore such resources and any mitigation measures which may be considered as a condition of issuing a permit for such activity including but not limited to measures to 1 prevent or minimize pollution or other environmental damage 2 maintain or enhance existing environmental quality or 3 in the following order of priority restore enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse resources this requires recognition that the inland wetlands and watercourses of the state of connecticut are an indispensable irreplaceable and fragile natural resource and that these areas may be irreversibly destroyed by deposition filling and removal of material by the diversion diminution or obstruction of water flow including low flows and by the erection of structures and other uses  e the character and degree of injury to or interference with safety health or the reasonable use of property including abutting or downstream property which is caused or threatened by the proposed regulated activity this includes recognition of potential damage from erosion turbidity or siltation loss of fish and wildlife and their habitat loss of unique habitat having demonstrable natural scientific or educational value loss or diminution of beneficial aquatic organisms and wetland plants the dangers of flooding and pollution and the destruction of the economic aesthetic recreational and other public and private uses and values of wetlands and watercourses to the community  17 f impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses outside the area for which the activity is proposed and future activities associated with or reasonably related to the proposed regulated activity which are made inevitable by the proposed regulated activity and which may have an impact on wetlands and watercourses  g the suitability of the activity to the area for which it is proposed this requires a balancing of the need for the economic growth of the state and the use of its land with the need to protect its environment and ecology for the people of the state and the benefit of generations yet unborn  h measures which would mitigate the impact of any aspect of the proposed regulated activity such measures include but are not limited to actions which would avoid adverse impacts or lessen impacts to wetlands and watercourses and which could be feasibly carried out by the applicant and would protect the wetlands or watercourses natural capacity to support fish and wildlife to prevent flooding to supply and protect surface and ground waters to control sedimentation to prevent erosion to assimilate wastes to facilitate drainage to control pollution to support recreational activities and open space and to promote public health and safety  i the discharge of untreated runoff from paved surfaces  treatment of runoff from such surfaces shall be required at the discretion of the agency  j maintaining natural drainage systems including perennial and intermittent streams swales and drainage ditches in an open condition  and k a nondisturbance buffer zone is a necessary part of any permit in order to separate construction development or other regulated activities to prevent harm to the regulated area therefore the agency shall require at a minimum a nondisturbance buffer zone encompassing the land area one hundred 100 feet from any wetland or watercourse as a condition of granting wetlands permits unless the applicant demonstrates evidence in the record that such activity within the 100foot nondisturbance area does not pose an impact to the regulated area factors to be considered in determining the appropriate width of a buffer zone include but are not necessarily limited to the presence of steep slopes the intensity of adjacent land use soil erodibility the size and characteristics of a watercourse eg intermittent versus perennial vegetation types and conditions and whether the wetlandwatercoursefloodplain is a tributary to a public water supply reservoir or lies within a public water supply watershed the buffer zone shall be protected from site disturbance during and after construction and native vegetation shall be left in place to the maximum extent feasible therefore the extent and protection of the non disturbance buffer zone will be considered in the deliberations future applications seeking alteration of any non disturbance buffer zone may be considered and approved by the agency only upon determination of a substantial change in circumstance warranting such alteration buffer zones may also be protected using deed restrictions or conservation easements as mitigation for regulated activities 103 in the case of an application which received a public hearing pursuant to a finding by the agency that the proposed activity may have a significant impact on wetlands or watercourses a permit shall not be issued unless the agency finds on the basis of the record that a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist in making this finding the agency shall consider the facts and circumstances set forth in subsection 102 of this section the finding and the reasons therefore shall be stated on the record in writing 104 in the case of an application which is denied on the basis of a finding that there may be feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed regulated activity which have less adverse impact on wetlands or watercourses the agency shall propose on the record in writing the types of alternatives which the applicant may investigate provided this subsection shall not be construed to 18 shift the burden from the applicant to prove that he is entitled to the permit or to present alternatives to the proposed regulated activity 105 for purposes of this section 1 wetlands and watercourses includes aquatic plant or animal life and habitats in wetlands or watercourses and 2 habitats means areas or environments in which an organism or biological population normally lives or occurs 106 a municipal inland wetlands and watercourses commission shall not deny or condition an application for a regulated activity in an area outside wetlands or watercourses on the basis of an impact or effect on aquatic plant or animal life unless such activity will likely impact or affect the physical characteristics of such wetlands or watercourses 107 in reaching its decision on any application after a public hearing the agency shall base its decision on the record of that hearing documentary evidence or other material not in the hearing record shall not be considered by the agency in its decision however the agency is not precluded from seeking advice from information already in the record of the public hearing a conclusion that a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist does not create a presumption that a permit should be issued the applicant has the burden of demonstrating that the application is consistent with the purpose and policies of the inland wetlands and watercourses regulations of the town of hamden and of to 22a45 inclusive of the connecticut general statutes 108 the commission may require additional technical assistance in evaluating an application for a permit or for modification or extension of a permit or for any other matter properly appearing before the commission if it finds that the nature or intensity of the activity may present complexities requiring the expertise of a professional or expert environmental reviewer or the like possessing the requisite degree of knowledge education or training required to review such matter on behalf of the commission such area of expertise being outside that of the commission in all cases in which the commission feels such review of the matter is warranted the applicant shall be

services to and is engaged on behalf of the commission and town planner or its designees copies of the reviewers findings and reports shall be made available to the applicant and the commission not less than seven 7 days prior to any meeting of the commission to consider the reviewers reports and the matter and the applicant shall be given the opportunity to respond to said reports in writing the reviewer selection shall be preapproved by the commission failure to pay the reviewers charges shall be grounds for denial of the application dismissal of the matter or the like 109 in the case of an application where the applicant has provided written notice pursuant to subsection 711c of these regulations the holder of the restriction may provide proof to the inland wetlands agency that granting of the permit application will violate the terms of the restriction upon a finding that the requested land use violates the terms of such restriction the inland wetlands agency shall not grant the permit approval 1010 in the case of an application where the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of subsections 711c or 711d of these regulations the party holding the conservation or preservation restriction may not later than fifteen days after receipt of actual notice of permit approval file an appeal with the inland wetlands agency subject to the rules and 19 regulations of
