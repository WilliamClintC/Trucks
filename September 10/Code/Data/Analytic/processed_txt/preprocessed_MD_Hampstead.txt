applicable regulations contained in other articles shall apply in the ir restricted industrial district  135132 principal permitted uses principal permitted uses shall be as follows the restricted industrial ir district is established to provide areas for light industrial uses particularly uses that offer a wide range of employment opportunities this district is designed to have high performance standards and to accommodate uses that can be located in close proximity to commercial uses and in locations convenient to residential areas without creating nuisances or overburdening infrastructure the performance standards of the ir district reflect the towns commitment to stewardship of the natural environment and to sustainable development this includes industrial development that affords local residents the opportunity to work close to home the standards also reflect the increasing scarcity of groundwater in the piedmont plateau a the district regulations are designed to permit the operations of most offices research manufacturing and flex space activities the intent of the regulations is to respect the broad authority of the planning and zoning commission under state law to determine the design architecture and site layout of a development to ensure that the industrial uses in the district do not deleteriously effect other uses within the district adjoining property owners the community or the environment the ir district is meant for industrial not commercial uses some incidental commercial or retail uses are permitted that service the industrial uses within the industrial area or that do not depend upon intensive visits by customers from outside the industrial area b business offices of all types professional corporate government and nonprofit a b

overlay zone added 10142003 by   135151 purpose  135152 delineation of overlay zone the purpose of the resource protection overlay zone is to provide for the protection and conservation of endangered and threatened animal species and wildlife and fisheries habitat by preventing development that would disrupt significant species andor habitat and ensuring the design of nearby development is done in such a manner as not to degrade significant species andor habitat a of principal concern is the identified habitat area for the state and federally listed bog turtle with regard to the bog turtle the goal of this article is to protect maintain restore and improve the hydrological and ecological conditions of the wetlands in which the bog turtle lives the hydrology of the bog turtle habitat is sustained by groundwater and surface water flows this article is designed to regulate future land use within the wetlands watershed to prevent negative hydrologic impacts to the bog turtle habitat and to identify and preserve migratory corridors for the species this article also delineates areas where development may occur in compliance with performance standards and where such development does not materially harm the bog turtle or its habitat b the resource protection overlay zone applies to any area mapped by the maryland department of environment maryland department of natural resources or united states fish and wildlife service as habitat for any species appearing on the official state or federal list of endangered or threatened species the resource protection overlay zone shall include a minimum buffer area of 300 feet around any defined habitat area in the case of the bog turtle species the overlay zone shall extend to the limits of the topographic surface watershed of the identified bog turtle habitat as delineated in the bog turtle resource protection overlay zone map kept on file in the hampstead town offices a the overlay zone is subdivided into four separate zones as follows zone 1 this zone is defined as the wetlands which the bog turtle is known to inhabit and those wetlands they are likely to inhabit as shown on the bog turtle resource protection overlay zone map the specific boundary of zone 1 is defined in the field by determining the wetland boundary using the 1987 corps of engineers wetland identification and delineation manual 1 b  135151 development impact fees  135152   135153 application to other zoning districts the resource protection overlay zone shall overlay the existing zoning districts created by the zoning its terms and

govern  135154 compliance with natural resource management plans any permitted or exceptional uses within the resource protection overlay zone shall comply with all adopted federal state or local natural resource management plans  135155 requirement for exceptional use permit all new structures and changes of use extending into the resource protection overlay zone shall require an exceptional use permit except as otherwise permitted in this chapter if an exceptional use permit is required the planning and zoning commission shall not approve any preliminary or final subdivision site plan or change of use for any property that extends into a resource protection overlay zone until such permit has been granted  135156 process for exceptional use permit zone 2 this zone is defined as a threehundredfoot zone measured horizontally from the zone 1 boundary or the topographic boundary of the watershed whichever is less 2 zone 3 this zone includes the channel of all tributaries flowing into the zone i wetlands including intermittent streams as shown on the bog turtle resource protection overlay zone map located outside of zones 1 and 2 zone 3 also includes a onehundredfiftyfoot buffer zone measured horizontally from the top of all perennial stream channel banks and in all directions from the headwaters of such tributaries or to the topographic boundary of the watershed whichever is less and a onehundredfoot buffer zone measured horizontally from the top of all intermittent stream channel banks and in all directions from the headwaters of such tributaries or to the topographic boundary of the watershed whichever is less zone 3 also includes all vegetated wetlands located in the watershed but not in zone 1 or 2 the specific boundaries of these wetlands are defined in the field by determining the wetland boundary using the 1987 corps of engineers wetland identification and delineation manual 3 zone 4 this zone is defined as those portions of the topographic surface watershed which are not included in zones 1 2 or 3 within zone 4 surface and groundwater are presumed to flow into the identified bog turtle habitat 4  135152 hampstead code

formal review of the probable effects of the proposed structure or change in use on significant habitat and species in determining whether an adverse impact will occur the planning and zoning
