are concerned if the permit recipient provides a performance bond or other security satisfactory to the board to ensure that all of these requirements will be fulfilled within a reasonable period not to exceed twelve 12 months b when the board imposes additional requirements upon the permit recipient or when the developer proposes in the plans submitted to install amenities beyond those required

installed if it specifies a date by which or a schedule according to which such requirements must be met or each amenity installed and if it concludes that compliance will be ensured as the result of one or more of the following i a performance bond or other security satisfactory to the board is furnished 1428 ii a condition is imposed establishing an automatic expiration date on the permit

board of zoning appeals disapproves an application for a special exception permit or a variance on any basis other than the failure of the applicant to submit a complete application such action may not be reconsidered by the bza at a later time unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that i circumstances affecting the property that is the subject of the application have substantially changed or ii new information is available that could not with reasonable diligence have been presented at a previous hearing a request to be heard on this basis must be filed with the administrator within sixty 60 days of the decision filing a request to be reheard does not toll the period for appeal in chancery court b notwithstanding subsection a the board of zoning appeals may at any time consider a new application affecting the same property as an application previously denied a new application is one that differs in some substantial way in the judgment of the bza from the one previously considered 19 applications to be processed expeditiously recognizing that inordinate delays in acting upon appeals or applications may impose unnecessary costs on the appellant or applicant the city

#200632 june 2006 14208 nonconforming situations 1 definitions unless otherwise specifically provided or unless clearly required by the context the words and phrases defined in this section shall have the meaning indicated when used in this article a effective date of this ordinance whenever this section refers to the effective date of this ordinance the reference shall be deemed to include the effective date of any amendments to this ordinance if the amendment rather than this ordinance as originally adopted creates a nonconforming situation b expenditure a sum of money paid out in return for some benefit or to fulfill some obligation the term also includes binding contractual commitments to make future expenditures as well as any other substantial changes in position c nonconforming lot a lot existing at the effective date of this ordinance that does not meet the minimum area requirement of the district in which the lot is located d nonconforming project any structure development or undertaking that is incomplete at the effective date of this ordinance set forth in this chapter and would be inconsistent with any regulation applicable to the district in which it is located if completed as proposed or planned e nonconforming use a nonconforming situation that occurs when property is used for a purpose or in a manner made unlawful by the use regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located the term also refers to the activity that constitutes the use made of the property f nonconforming situation a situation that occurs when on the effective date of this ordinance set forth in this chapter an existing lot or structure or use of an existing lot or structure does not conform to one or more of the regulations applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is located among other possibilities a nonconforming situation may arise because a lot does not meet minimum acreage requirements because structures exceed maximum height limitations because the relationship between existing buildings and the land in such matters as density and setback requirements is not in conformity with this ordinance or because land or buildings are used for purposes made unlawful by this ordinance nonconforming signs shall not be regarded as nonconforming situations for purposes of this section but shall be governed by the provisions of this ordinance specifically addressing signs 2 continuation of nonconforming situations and completion of nonconforming projects a unless otherwise specifically provided by the 1439 provisions of this ordinance and subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in sections 3 8 nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of the provisions of this ordinance may be continued b nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of section 8 3 nonconforming lots a when a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use except that the lot is smaller than the required minimums set forth in  14214 then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming however no use eg a twofamily residence that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a particular zone is permissible on a nonconforming lot b when the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects but the applicable setback requirements cannot reasonably be complied with then the entity authorized by this ordinance to issue a permit for the proposed use may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that i the property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such deviations ii these deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot and iii the property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health and safety c for purposes of subsection b compliance with applicable building setback requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practically be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with such setback requirements however mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible d this section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots a lot is undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it a change in use of a developed nonconforming lot may be accomplished in accordance with section 6 e subject to the following provision if on the date this section becomes effective an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one or more other undeveloped lots under the same ownership then neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor his successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section this subsection shall not apply to a nonconforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of the street where such lot is located and within five hundred 500 feet of such lot are also 1440 nonconforming the intent of this subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to create conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein but not to require such combination when that would be out of character with the way the neighborhood has previously been developed 4 extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations a subject to provisions in state law regarding expansion of nonconforming uses found in tennessee  except as specifically provided in this section no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation in particular physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in i an increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use or ii greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as parking requirements b subject to subsection d a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that when the use was made nonconforming by this ordinance was clearly designed or arranged to accommodate such use however subject to  142088 which authorized the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances  a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building c subject to  142088 a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming except that a use that involves the removal of natural materials form the lot eg a quarry may be expanded to the boundaries of the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming if ten percent 10% or more of the earth products had already been removed on the effective date of this ordinance d the volume intensity or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other provisions of this section occur e notwithstanding subsection a any structure used for singlefamily residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with 1441 respect to such matters as setback and parking requirements this paragraph is subject to the limitations stated in  142087 f notwithstanding subsection a whenever 1 there exists a lot with one or more structures on it and 2 a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot and 3 the parking or loading requirements of this ordinance that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading then the proposed use shall not be regarded as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming situation however the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable parking and loading requirements that can be satisfied without acquiring additional land and shall also be required to obtain satellite parking if 1 parking requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot with respect to which the permit is required  and 2 such satellite parking is reasonably available if such satellite parking is not reasonably available at the time the zoning or special exception permit is granted then the permit recipient shall be required to obtain it if and when it does become reasonably available this requirement shall be a continuing condition of the permit 5 repair maintenance and reconstruction a minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist or permitted or encouraged major renovation ie work estimated to cost more than twentyfive percent 25% of the assessed value of the structure to be renovated on the most recent tax assessment may be done only in accordance with the provisions of paragraph b herein b if a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists with damage to an extent that the cost of repair or replacement would exceed twentyfive percent 25% of the assessed value of the damaged structure on the most recent tax assessment then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in accordance with the zoning permit issued pursuant to this section and in compliance with existing zoning and applicable codes this subsection does not apply to structures used for single family residential purposes which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a zoning permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in subsection 4e this subsection does not apply to duplex and multifamily structures in the oak park historic district zone xvi this subsection further does not apply to duplex and multifamily residential structures in the college hills historic district zone xiii where such duplex or multifamily residential structures were originally designed and constructed for duplex or multifamily use and where such duplex or multifamily use has been continuous since the time of construction in such case a duplex in zone xiii that was originally designed or constructed as a duplex could be rebuilt repaired or replaced 1442 as a duplex likewise a multifamily residential structure in zone xiii originally designed or constructed as a multifamily structure could be rebuilt repaired or replaced as a multifamily structure c for purposes of subsection a and b i the cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the fair market value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation repair or replacement ii the cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such intended work and no person may seek to avoid the intent of subsections a or b by doing such work on a piecemeal basis d the administrator shall issue a permit authorized by this section if he finds that in completing the renovation repair or replacement work i no violation of section 4 will occur and ii the permittee will comply to the extent reasonably possible with all provisions of this ordinance applicable to the existing use except that the permittee shall not lose his right to continue a nonconforming use compliance with a requirement of this ordinance is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible 6 change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists a a change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists that is sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning or special exception permit may not be made except in accordance with subsections b d however this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed b if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located and all of the other requirements of this ordinance applicable to that use can be complied with permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot once conformity with this ordinance is achieved the property may not revert to its nonconforming status c if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located but all of the requirements of this ordinance applicable to that use cannot reasonably be complied with then the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this ordinance to issue a permit for that particular use the 1443 administrator board of zoning appeals or council issues a permit authorizing the change this permit may be issued if the permitissuing authority finds in addition to any other findings that may be required by this ordinance that i the intended change will not result in a violation of section 4 and ii all of the applicable requirements of this ordinance that can reasonably be complied with will be complied with compliance with a requirement of this ordinance is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible and in case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created d if the intended change in use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming then the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this ordinance to issue a permit for that particular use administrator board of zoning appeals or council issues a permit authorizing the change the permitissuing authority may issue the permit if it finds in addition to other findings that may be required by this ordinance that i the use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning districts with either a zoning or special exception permit and ii all of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in subsection c of this section are satisfied and iii the proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most affected by it and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the permit is applied for 7 abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations a except where tennessee g requires otherwise when a nonconforming use is 1 discontinued for a consecutive period of one hundred eighty 180 days or 2 discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes b if the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity then 1444 that property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use unless the entity with authority to issue a permit for the intended use issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations this permit may be issued if the permitissuing authority finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible ie cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation the permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be correct c for purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section all of the buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use the discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter d when a structure or operation made nonconforming by this ordinance is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this ordinance the one hundred eighty 180 day period for purposes of this section begins to run on the effective date of this ordinance 8 completion of nonconforming projects a all nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least one hundred eighty 180 days before the effective date of this ordinance as well as all nonconforming projects that are at least ten 10 percent completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date of the provisions of this ordinance may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits so long as these permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired if a development is designed to be completed in stages this subsection shall apply only to the particular phase under construction b except as provided in subsection a all work on any nonconforming project shall cease on the effective date of this ordinance comprising this ordinance and all permits previously issued for work on nonconforming projects may begin or may be continued only pursuant to a zoning special exception or sign permit issued in accordance with this section by the individual or board authorized by this ordinance to issue permits for the type of development proposed the permitissuing authority shall issue such a permit if it finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed his position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the landuse law as it existed before the effective date of this ordinance and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if 1445 not allowed to complete his project as proposed in considering whether these findings may be made the permitissuing authority shall be guided by the following as well as other relevant considerations i all expenditures made to obtain or pursuant to a validly issued and unrevoked building zoning sign or special exception permit shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the landuse law that existed before this ordinance became effective ii except as provided in subsection bi no expenditures made more than one hundred eighty 180 days before the effective date of this ordinance may be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the landuse law that existed before this ordinance became effective an expenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure iii to the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures for example a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditure to acquire a potential development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new classification as it was under the old for the expenditure can be recovered by a sale of the property iv to the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of a conforming project a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made such expenditures v an expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant both in dollar amount and in terms of 1 the total estimated cost of the proposed project and 2 the ordinary business practices of the developer vi a person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge of a proposed change in the landuse law affecting the proposed development site could not be attributed to him vii even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the landuse law affecting a development site the permitissuing authority may still find that he acted in good faith if he did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance the permitissuing authority may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to undermine the proposed ordinance if it determines that 1 at the time the expenditures were made 1446 either there was considerable doubt about whether any ordinance would ultimately be passed or it was not clear that the proposed ordinance would prohibit the intended development and 2 the developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures c when it appears from the developers plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in phases stages segments or other discrete units the developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the developer can make the showing required under subsection b in addition to the matters and subject to the guidelines set forth in subdivisions i vi of subsection b the permitissuing authority shall in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project consider the following in addition to other relevant factors i whether any plans prepared or approved regarding uncompleted phases constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying architectural or engineering work ii whether any improvements such as streets or utilities have been installed in phases not yet completed iii whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed in such a manner or location or such a scale in anticipation of connection to or interrelationship with approved but uncompleted phases are constructed in conformity with existing regulations d the permitissuing authority shall not consider any application for the permit authorized by subsection b that is submitted more than sixty 60 days after the effective date of this ordinance the permitissuing authority may waive this requirement for good cause shown but in no case may extend the application deadline beyond one 1 year e the administrator shall send copies of this section to the persons listed as owner for tax purposed and developers if different from the owners of all properties in regard to which a nonconforming project is otherwise known to be in some stage of development this notice shall be sent by certified mail not less than fifteen 15 days before the effective date of the provisions of this ordinance f the permitissuing authority shall establish expedited procedures for hearing applications for permits under this section these applications shall be heard whenever possible before the effective date of

the designations 1 2 3 in table of permissible uses a subject to 3 when used in connection with a particular use in the table of permissible uses 1 the designation  means that the use is permissible in the indicated zoning district with a zoning permit issued by the administrator the number  means a special exception permit must be obtained from the board of zoning appeals the number  indicates that the use is not permitted in the indicated zoning district b when the use proposed requires a special exception permit the process for review of the impact overlay zone shall be employed 3 board of zoning appeals jurisdiction over uses otherwise permissible with a zoning permit notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance whenever the table of permissible uses provides that a use in a nonresidential zoning district or a nonconforming use in a residential zoning district is permissible with a zoning permit a special exception permit shall nevertheless be required if the administrator finds that the proposed use would 14125 have an extraordinary impact on neighboring properties or the general public in making this determination the administrator shall consider among other factors whether the use is proposed for an undeveloped or previously developed lot whether the proposed use constitutes a change from one principal use classification to another whether the use is proposed for a site that poses peculiar traffic or other hazards or difficulties and whether the proposed use is substantially unique or is likely to have impacts that differ substantially from those presented by other uses that are permissible in the zoning district in question 4 permissible uses and specific exclusions a the list of permissible uses set forth in 1 cannot be all inclusive  those uses that are listed shall be interpreted liberally to include other uses that have similar impacts to the listed uses b all uses that are not listed in 1 even given the liberal interpretation mandated by subsection a are prohibited 1 shall not be interpreted to allow a use in one zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another specified use that is permissible in other zoning districts c without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions the following uses are specifically prohibited in all districts i any use that involves the manufacture handling sale distribution or storage of any highly combustible or explosive materials in violation of the citys fire prevention code ii stockyards slaughterhouses rendering plants iii use of travel trailer as a temporary or permanent residence iv short term rental units 5 accessory uses a the table of permissible uses classifies different principal uses according to their different impacts whenever an activity which may or may not be separately listed as a principal use in this table is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use 1 constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot or 2 is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use example a swimming pool andor tennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential subdivision or multifamily development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal uses even though such facilities if developed apart form a residential development would require a special exception permit b for purposes of interpreting subsection a 14126 i a use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to the principal use ii to be commonly associated with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not but only that the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness iii without limiting the generality of subsection a and b the following activities so long as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above are specifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses a offices or studios within an enclosed building and used by an occupant of a residence located on the same lot as such building to carry on administrative or artistic activities of a commercial nature so long as such activities do not fall within the definition of a home occupation b hobbies or recreational activities of a noncommercial nature c the renting out of one or two rooms within a singlefamily residence which one or two rooms do not themselves constitute a separate dwelling unit to not more than two persons who are not part of the family that resides in the singlefamily dwelling d garage sales so long as such activities conform to the applicable maryville municipal see  9102 iv without limiting the generality of subsections a and b the following activities shall not be regarded as accessory to a residential principal use and are prohibited in residential districts a storage outside of a substantially enclosed structure of any motor vehicle that is neither licensed nor operational b parking outside a substantially enclosed structure of more than four motor vehicles between the front building line of the principal building and the street on any lot used for purposes that fall within the following principal use classifications singlefamily residential twofamily residential special residential v a jumbotron is an oversized video monitor that is allowed as an accessory use for events at the maryville high 14127 school football stadium a jumbotron shall be sited and oriented so as to serve the audience at the event and to minimize its visibility by persons who are offsite of the event a jumbotron is not a billboard a digital billboard or an electronic message center sign as defined by  14218 signs of this code 6 permissible uses not requiring permits

water and sewer lines wires or pipes together with supporting poles or structures located within a public rightofway c neighborhood utility facilities located within a public rightofway with the permission of the owner state or city of the rightofway 7 change in use a a substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character or nature of the activity conducted on a lot changes this occurs whenever i the change involves a change from one principal use category to another ii if the original use is a planned unit development reviewed and approved impact overlay provisions of this ordinance the relative proportion of space devoted to the individual principal uses that comprise the planned unit development changes to such an extent that the parking requirements for the overall use are altered iii if the original used is a planned unit development use the mixtures of types of individual principal uses that comprise the planned unit development use changes iv if the original use is a planned residential development the relative proportions of different types of dwelling units change v if there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot that business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in b a mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice versa does not constitute a change in use whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than one hundred eighty 180 consecutive days or has been abandoned c a mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the name shall not be regarded as a change in use 14128 8 combination uses a when permitted uses are combined within a development and include two or more principal uses that require different types of permits zoning special exception then the permit authorizing the combination of uses shall be i a special exception permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special exception permit ii zoning permit in all other cases b when a combination of uses consists of a singlefamily detached residential subdivision that is not integrally designed and twofamily or multifamily uses the total density permissible on the entire tract shall be determined by having the developer indicate on the plans the portion of the total lot that will be developed for each purpose and calculating the density for each portion as if it were a separate lot c when a combination use consists of a singlefamily detached integrally designed subdivision and twofamily or multifamily uses then the total density permissible on the entire tract shall be determined by dividing the area of the tract by the minimum area in square feet per dwelling unit specified  14214 9 more specific use controls

to ensure that these amenities will be compatible with and respectful of their immediate surroundings a lighted outdoor park recreational and athletic facilities when these facilities are lighted for nighttime use not only are the daytime effects of the activities extended into the evening hours but the issue of light trespass must also be considered effective management of this issue can take several forms including planning for a physical separation between new facilities and existing sensitive land uses providing buffering between activity centers and adjoining properties matching the height of the light poles to the needs of the activity being lit and using the full cut off shielded type of luminaries b the differing nature of individual sports and activities dictates how tall the

neighborhoods and property owners  ii to encourage quality development by ensuring attractive and complementary landscaping  and iii to enhance the scenic beauty of maryville b because of projected growth in the city a landscaping and screening ordinance is necessary for the following reasons i to lessen the impact of high intensity land uses that adjoin lower intensity land uses commercial development sometimes encroaches on residential neighborhoods this ordinance is a law requiring that a strip of trees bushes andor fences act as a buffer between high intensity land uses such as a shopping center or convenience store and low intensity land uses such as residential housing this helps ensure that development can occur around established areas with minimal impacts ii to create adequate screening within residential zones to protect existing residential properties sometimes new developments have the potential to decrease privacy for existing residential areas especially when new activity centers a parking lot playground swimming pool driveways sports fields club houses etc are built near existing property boundaries screening 14167 of activity centers increases privacy for residents while accommodating development iii to protect existing residential properties from glare associated with outdoor lighting excessive glare and light trespass on existing properties is a growing concern for many maryville residents this ordinance minimizes the amount of light that can shine across property lines iv to ensure that maryvilles best foot forward will be presented to potential residents businesses and tourists at the junction of several major approaches to the great smoky mountains maryville has the opportunity to leave a favorable impression on millions of travelers as a national arbor day foundation tree city usa this ordinance satisfies an important criterion for maintaining this designation 2 definitions as used in this article the following words

variety of different physical land features in the maryville area screening types a b and c are in place to screen new development from incompatible land uses or activity centers any form of screening types a b or c may be chosen depending on each sites topography and situation the successful location of a landscape buffer to adequately screen a new development from an existing residential use is dependent on several variables for most projects particularly for projects that are on level topography with adjacent residential uses the landscape buffer will likely be proposed and approved along the outer perimeter of the property line however when existing and proposed topography varies between proposed development and adjacent residential use the landscape buffer must be more closely evaluated the zoning administrator has authority to require relocation of proposed landscape buffer locations if he determines a more effective buffer location would maximize the shortand longterm visual effectiveness and survivability of the landscape buffer review of proposed landscape buffers will be based on the following attributes existing and proposed topography between the new development and adjacent residential use  location of utilities  elevation of building pads  location of buildings  desirable views to protect  and height of walls type a existing natural screen for those properties that have significant vegetation that exists along property lines and may be appropriate for screening the type a option should be chosen the width of the natural screen shall be at least twentyfive feet 25 if a substantial screen of less than 25 exists a written request can be sent to the administrator for review to ensure that all existing natural screens are consistent in opacity and depth a site visit by the planning department will be necessary to determine if the natural screen is in the spirit of the type a option for those properties that have little or no existing vegetation type b or c should be used type b dense screen any of the following variations may be chosen for the type b option 14170 i type b 1 screen width of fifteen 15 feet and above screening trees spaced at a maximum of ten 10 feet as measured trunk to trunk  and shade trees spaced at a maximum of twenty 20 feet apart ii type b 2 screen width of ten 10 feet to fifteen 15 feet screening trees spaced at a maximum of ten 10 feet as measured trunk to trunk  shade trees spaced at a maximum of twenty 20 feet apart  and screening shrubs spaced at a maximum of 5 apart trees and shrubs already in place should be implemented into the landscaping pattern all plantings shall meet the installation and planting size requirements specified in the plant installation specifications section type c combination screen any of the following variations may be chosen for the type c option i type c 1 screen width of fifteen 15 feet and above screening trees spaced at a maximum of fifteen 15 feet as measured trunk to trunk or two staggered rows of screening shrubs spaced at a maximum of ten 10 feet apart the plantings shall face the existing property  and an opaque fence or masonry wall of at least six 6 feet in height which shall face the new development ii type c 2 screen width of ten 10 feet to fifteen 15 feet screening trees spaced at a maximum of 10 as measured trunk to trunk or two staggered rows of screening shrubs spaced at a maximum of seven 7 feet apart the plantings shall face the existing property  and an opaque fence or masonry wall of at least 6 in height which shall face the new development trees and shrubs already in place should be implemented into the landscaping pattern all plantings shall meet the installation and planting size requirements specified in the plant installation specifications section b if a proposed high intensity development is bordered by existing lower intensity development across a street type d street buffer is required type d street screening where a proposed commercial office or highintensity residential development more than 2 family residential borders any residential development on the opposite side of a street alley or other public or private way type d screening is required choose from the following minimum 10 screen width an opaque fence or masonry wall of at least six 6 feet in height with a series of screening trees spaced at a maximum of fifteen 15 feet from trunk to trunk on alternating sides of the fencewall and screening shrubs shall alternate between the trees 14171 on the street side of the fencewall screening must be planted on the property at a minimum distance of ten 10 feet from the street rightofway to observe utility easements plantings must not impair vision or line of sight of ingress and egress trees and shrubs already in place should be implemented into the landscaping pattern all plantings shall meet the installation and planting size requirements specified in the plant installation specification section the engineering department will review the site plan to make sure that sight distance is adequate before landscaping can begin the planning department staff is authorized to consider proposed alternatives to the street screening type d as long as the proposed buffer or screen meets or exceeds the opacity requirements of this section proposed alternative landscaping plans may eliminate the required fencing if approved by the planning department a landscape plan will still be required for any alternative to the type d requirements proposed by the applicant 6 outdoor lighting requirements this section involves the measurement and regulation of light along property lines to protect the privacy comfort and character of existing residential neighborhoods outdoor lighting is important for night visibility safety and security outdoor lighting can however also invade privacy and cause nuisance if excessive glare and direct light trespasses on established residential properties these requirements ensure that new development minimizes the amount of light that may shine on abutting properties the following is required when installing lights a a lighting plan may be required as determined by the planning department  b a light point by point footcandle diagram must be shown on the site plan with a 10 x 10 foot maximum grid the diagram should cover the at least ten feet on either side of property lines that border residential zones or uses  c lighting must not exceed one footcandle at or beyond the property line

due to the particularities of any given development the inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in subsection 2e may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs the former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots the latter situation wastes money as well as space that could more desirably be used for valuable development or environmentally useful open space therefore as suggested in 2 the permitissuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of subsection 2e and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in subsection 2a b without limiting the generality of the foregoing the permitissuing authority may allow deviations from the parking requirements set forth in subsection 2e when it finds that i a residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly  ii a business is primarily oriented to walkin trade 14216 c whenever the permitissuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive parking requirements set forth in subsection 2e it shall enter on the face of the permit the parking requirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation d if the permitissuing authority concludes based upon information it receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal that the presumption established by subsection 2e for a particular use classification is erroneous it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the table of parking requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in  14220 4

may contain required spaces for several different uses but except as otherwise provided in this section the required space assigned to one use may not be credited to any other use b to the extent that developments that wish to make joint use of the same parking spaces operate at different times the same spaces may be credited to both uses for example if a parking lot is used in connection with an office building on monday but is generally ninety percent 90% vacant on weekends another development that operates only on weekends could be credited with ninety percent 90% of the spaces on that lot or if a church parking lot is generally occupied only to fifty percent 50% of capacity on days of primary use another development could make use of fifty percent 50% of the church lots spaces on those

constructed before the effective date of this ordinance and 2 a changing use that does involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot and 3 the parking requirements of 2 that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking then the developer need only comply with the requirements of 2 to the extent that 1 parking space is practicably available on the lot where the development is located and 2 satellite parking spaces are reasonably available

service charge are hereby adopted and incorporated by reference as part of this code as added by #200331 oct 2003 19502 findings the council of the city of maryville makes the following additional findings 1 an equitable approach to funding stormwater management services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of service charges upon properties that is related to burden of stormwater quantity and quality control service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city 2 such schedule of service charges can be complemented by other funding methods that address specific needs including but not limited to allocations of local option sales taxes to stormwater drainage improvement projects collection of fees for special services including but not limited to plans review and inspections and establishment of a capital recovery fee or fees consistent with state law 1this chapter renumbered in conjunction with change 8  1949 3 a service charge credit is an appropriate means of adjusting service charges in recognition that private stormwater systems andor actions can effectively reduce or eliminate the burden of stormwater quantity and quality control service requirements and costs that a property or properties pose for the city in addition the value to the stormwater utility of certain actions and practices performed by property owners and other stormwater utility customers may be recognized by credits based on other factors including but not limited to the avoided cost of public information and education realized by the utility when public information and education about stormwater management is provided by the public school system 4 impervious area is the most important factor influencing stormwater service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city and therefore is an appropriate parameter for calculating stormwater service charges and associated credits as added by #200331 oct 2003
