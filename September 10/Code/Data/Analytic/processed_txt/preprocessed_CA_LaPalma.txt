playgrounds and public rightsofway owned operated andor maintained by the city are operated and maintained for the use benefit recreation and enjoyment of all citizens and residents of the city as well as to eliminate to the greatest extent possible the secondary effects associated with the presentation of nudity in adult oriented businesses the city council finds that it is both in the public interest and necessary to protect and promote the public health safety and welfare and that said parks playgrounds and public rightsofway be utilized and enjoyed by as many persons as possible  that maximum utilization and enjoyment of said parks playgrounds and public rightsofway can only be obtained of regulations regarding activities thereon  the appearance of persons utilizing said parks playgrounds and public rightsofway without clothing and with the private parts of their bodies exposed unreasonably interferes with the rights of all persons to use and enjoy said parks playgrounds and public rightsofway by causing many persons to leave and others not to use said parks playgrounds and public rightsofway  that such conduct and behavior imposes an extraordinary unusual burden on city employees charged with the maintenance of said parks playgrounds and public rightsofway and public safety personnel who are diverted from fulfilling their primary obligation to protect the health safety and welfare of the public at large  that the presence of persons who are unclothed and exposed to public view in or on public rightsofway parks and playgrounds or on any private property open to public view from public parks and playgrounds or other public ways tends to discourage the use and enjoyment of said public parks and public ways of the city and creates a nuisance and is offensive to members of the public who wish to use and enjoy said public parks playgrounds and public rightsofway and who are unwillingly exposed to such conduct  that the presentation of nude entertainment in adult oriented businesses results in secondary effects which include the proliferation of prostitution the increase in sexual assaults and increase in other crimes  that the prohibition of nudity in adult oriented businesses tends to reduce the existence of such secondary effects  and based upon the foregoing findings this section will protect the public health safety and welfare b prohibition of public nudity it is unlawful for any person to appear bathe sunbathe walk or be on any public park playground or on any other public land or on any private property open to public view from any
