issued upon 1 a showing of good and sufficient cause  2 a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  3 a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in

pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in

those who benefit from new growth and development pay a proportionate share of the cost of new public facilities needed to serve new growth and development  3 ensure that those who benefit from new growth and development are required to pay no more than their proportionate share of the cost of public facilities needed to serve new growth and development  and 4 prevent duplicate and ad hoc

been prepared in conformance with the requirements of chapters 65 and 82 of title 67 of the idaho the development impact fee study sets forth reasonable methodologies and analyses for determining the impacts of various types of new development on the city capital facilities and determines the cost of acquiring or constructing the improvements necessary to meet the demands for such facilities created by new development n in accordance with idaho the development impact fee study was based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs in addition the development impact fee study uses a fee calculation methodology that is net of credits for the present value of revenues that will be generated by new growth and development based on historical funding patterns and that are anticipated to be available to pay for system improvements including taxes assessments user fees and intergovernmental transfers  sterling codifiers inc  422467 o the development impact fees described in this chapter are based on the development impact fee study and do not exceed the costs of system improvements for city capital facilities to serve new development that will pay the development impact fees p the facilities for police and fire included in the calculation of fees in the development impact fee study will benefit all new residential and nonresidential development throughout the city and it is therefore appropriate to treat all areas of the city as a single service area for purposes of calculating collecting and spending the development impact fees collected from residential and nonresidential development q there is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between the development impacts created by each type of development covered by this chapter and the development impact fees that such development will be required to pay r this chapter creates a system by which development impact fees paid by new development will be used to finance defray or reimburse a portion of the costs incurred by the city to construct improvements for city capital facilities in ways that benefit the development for which each development impact fee was paid within a reasonable period of time after the development impact fee is paid and in conformance with idaho  s this chapter creates a system under which development impact fees shall not be used to correct existing deficiencies for any capital facilities or to replace or rehabilitate existing improvements or to pay for routine operation or maintenance of those facilities t this chapter creates a system under which there shall be no double payment of impact fees in accordance with idaho 19 u this chapter is consistent with all applicable provisions of chapter 82 title 67 idaho concerning development impact fee ordinances   authority and applicability a this chapter is enacted pursuant to the citys general police power the authority granted to the city pursuant to chapters 65 and 82 title 67 idaho

plan and particularly the capital improvements element of that plan  sterling codifiers inc  423467 b the intent of this chapter is to ensure that new development bears a proportionate share of the cost of improvements to city capital facilities  to ensure that such proportionate share does not exceed the cost of improvements to such facilities required to accommodate new development  and to ensure that funds collected from new development are actually used for improvements to city capital facilities that benefit such new development c it is the further intent of this chapter to be consistent with those principles for allocating a fair share of the cost of new capital facilities to new development and for adopting development impact fee ordinances established by chapter 82 title 67 of the idaho it is not the intent of this chapter to collect any money from any new development in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset new demands for city capital facilities created by such new development e it is not the intent of this chapter that any monies collected from any development impact fee deposited in an impact fee account ever be commingled with monies from a different impact fee account or ever be used for a development impact fee component different from that for which the fee was paid or ever be used to correct current deficiencies in the city capital facilities or ever be used to replace rehabilitate maintain or operate any city facility   definitions for the purpose of this chapter the following terms shall have the following meanings some of which are
