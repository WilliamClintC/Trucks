supply system g in cases where an existing structure is being remodeled or reconstructed or where a change in the use of an existing structure will or may create a greater degree of hazard to the public water supply system than previously existed the city administrator may consider 1 differences in the cost of devices and backflow prevention assemblies when comparing the type of backflow preventer specified by the director to the type of backflow preventer preferred by the owner  2 differences in the cost of installing and maintaining the two 2 types of backflow preventers being compared  3 other significant cost differences or practical difficulties associated with the use installation andor maintenance of the backflow preventers being compared  4 other relevant life safety

public education  b public involvement  c elimination of illicit discharges  d construction site erosion control  e post construction monitoring  and f municipal operations there is a cost involved with this unfunded mandate to implement these measures 6 the public health safety and welfare is adversely affected by poor ambient water quality and flooding that results from inadequate management of both the quality and quantity of stormwater 7 all real property in the city either uses or benefits from the maintenance of the stormwater system 8 the extent of use of the stormwater system by each property is dependant on factors that influence runoff including land use and the amount of impervious surface on the property 9 the costs of improving maintaining operating and monitoring the stormwater system should be allocated to the extent practicable to all property owners based on the impact of runoff from the impervious areas of their property on the stormwater management system 10 management of the stormwater system to protect the public health safety and welfare requires adequate revenues and it is in the interest of the public to finance stormwater management adequately with

stormwater and flood management  3 to establish a stormwater utility enterprise to coordinate design construct manage operate and maintain the stormwater and flood management systems and stormwater projects and facilities  4 to establish reasonable stormwater utility service charges based on the use and availability of stormwater facilities  and 5 to encourage and facilitate urban water resources management techniques including without limitation detention of floods and stormwater runoff minimizing the need to construct stormwater facilities reduction of pollution and enhancement of

and interpretation a intent it is the intent of this chapter to prohibit and otherwise restrict certain land uses related to the cultivation use and disposition of marijuana plants and products and in furtherance of its intent the city council makes the following findings 1 the colorado medical marijuana crs somewhat clarifies colorado law regarding the scope and extent of  of the colorado constitution but does not adequately address issues related to cultivation use processing or disposition of medical marijuana by patients and caregivers  2 rules regarding the cultivation and use of medical marijuana by patients and caregivers have been adopted and are periodically amended by the colorado department of public health and environment but do not adequately or completely foreclose opportunities for serious abuses by some persons who claim a medical need for excessive numbers of marijuana plants thus making the adoption of this chapter necessary  3 the colorado medical marijuana authorizes a municipality to either prohibit or license and otherwise regulate the operation of medical marijuana centers optional premises cultivation operations and medical marijuanainfused products

facilities and retail marijuana stores enactment of ordinances but does not address in any meaningful way cultivation of medical marijuana by unlicensed persons including patients and caregivers  5 the voters of the city of caon city in november 201 decided to ban all forms of retail marijuana establishments from the city  and 6 based on the expressed wishes of the citys voters and the implications that may be drawn therefrom and after careful consideration of applicable colorado laws and after having considered potential benefits and impacts associated with the cultivation of large numbers of marijuana plants for medical use or for personal use including secondary effects and impacts upon neighbors and neighborhoods that are associated with the cultivation of marijuana plants the cultivation of marijuana is hereby found to be a land use that may and probably will have an adverse effect on the health safety and welfare of many inhabitants of the city including most specifically those who reside adjacent or close to locations where large numbers of marijuana plants are cultivated by unlicensed persons if such cultivation is not appropriately limited and otherwise effectively regulated to prevent or minimize such adverse impacts b authority the citys authority to adopt this chapter is found in the colorado medical marijuana the colorado retail marijuana

 title and purpose a statutory authorization the legislature of the state of colorado has in of title 29 and of of title 31 colorado revised statutes delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 promote sound planning use and development of floodplain areas consistent with the degree of hazard involved  2 protect human life and health  3 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  4 protect the public from avoidable financial expenditures for the repair and restoration of flood damaged public and private facilities  5 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  6 minimize prolonged business interruptions  7 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  8 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  9 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area and minimize victimization of unwary home and land purchasers  and 10 ensure that those who occupy the special flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 facilitate the administration of flood hazard areas by establishing requirements that must be met before use or development is permitted  2 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  3 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  4 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  5 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  6 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands   definitions as used in this chapter the meaning of certain words and phrases shall be as set out in this section unless
