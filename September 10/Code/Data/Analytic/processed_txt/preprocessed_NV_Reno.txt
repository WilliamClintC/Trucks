failing to abate substandard housing has more adverse and farreaching consequences such as the loss of housing and displacement of individuals b the purpose of this chapter is to address the shortage of safe sanitary and affordable rental housing options for residents in the city nontransient lodging rental properties that were formerly built as motels have historically provided affordable rental options of last resort for lowincome persons this chapter proactively identifies blighted and deteriorated nontransient lodging rental properties and enables them to rehabilitate units that do not meet minimum building housing and property maintenance code standards so as to provide safe habitable rental units for lowincome persons to occupy and further to preserve and enhance the quality of life for residents of the city c it is important that the city not only enforce on a complaintinitiated basis but also conduct routine annual inspections in order to better address and reduce substandard housing within structures that were formerly built as transient motels in the city it is important to conduct routine inspections on nontransient lodging rental properties due to the inherent problems associated with properties that are essentially converted from transient to nontransient lodging d in the city of reno it is imperative to establish enforceable minimum standards for

derived from  adopted    adopted sept 28 1999   adopted feb 28 2007   adopted jan 16 2008 purpose and findings a the purpose of these adult business regulations is to prevent crime protect the city tourist and retail trade maintain property values and preserve the quality of the citys neighborhoods commercial districts and urban life and permit reasonable alternative avenues of communication to prevent the proliferation of illegal sexrelated businesses it is not the intent nor effect of this code to restrict or deny access by adults to adult businesses protected by the first amendment  nor is it to suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment instead the intent is to enact a contentneutral ordinance which addresses the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses the predominant concern of these regulations is the limitation and prevention of the adverse secondary effects of the operation of adult businesses which manifest of minors to adult business activities and materials including in the form of exterior signage distraction to motorists harm to neighboring properties businesses and tourism spread of disease commission of crime and exacerbation of these effects by the clustering of adult businesses and allowance and use of alcohol on the premises of adult businesses the provisions of these regulations have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing any limitation or restriction on the content of any communication including adult businessrelated materials or performances similarly it is neither the intent nor effect of these regulations to restrict or deny access by adults to adult businessrelated communication protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors exhibitors and performers of adult businessrelated communication to their intended market likewise the city seeks to assure adequate locations within the city of reno for the conduct of adult businesses and that regulations governing adult businesses are content neutral reasonable time place and manner regulations furthering the purpose of these regulations b based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of the operation of adult businesses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city council including findings and interpretations incorporated in multiple court cases and including multiple studies and reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around adult businesses the city council finds 1 adult businesses as a category of commercial uses are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including but not limited to personal and property crimes prostitution potential spread of disease lewdness public indecency obscenity illicit drug use and drug trafficking negative impacts on surrounding properties urban blight exposure of minors to adult business activities and materials including in the form of exterior signage exposure of minors to alcohol and adverse secondary effects associated with adult businesses decrease in nearby property value in both commercial and residential areas impairment to the economic vitality of nearby businesses litter and sexual assault and exploitation alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions thereby increasing the risk of and exacerbating adverse secondary effects 2 adult businesses should be separated by suitable zoning location and reasonably spaced from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses 3 each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing andor abating this substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects which is the citys rationale for this section of code exists independent of any comparative analysis between adult businesses and nonadult businesses in addition the citys interest in regulating adult businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future adult businesses that may locate in the city the city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this section of code are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects the city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses including

that are addictive and inherently dangerous causing cancer heart disease and other serious illnesses  4 the city of reno has a substantial interest in reducing the number of individuals of all ages who use cigarettes and other tobacco products and a particular interest in protecting adolescents from tobacco dependence and the illnesses and premature death associated with tobacco use  5 an overwhelming majority of americans who use tobacco products begin using such products while they are adolescents and become addicted to those products before reaching the age of 18  6 tobacco paraphernalia displays lead juveniles to develop favorable beliefs about tobacco use overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use and engage in illegal purchases of tobacco products or paraphernalia  7 the display of tobacco paraphernalia plays a crucial role in the decision of individuals and adolescents in particular to begin using tobacco products  8 the world health organization has endorsed a ban on retail tobacco product displays as an effective method of reducing tobacco use  9 research suggests that preventing the display of tobacco products will lead to a significant decrease in the number of adolescents becoming addicted to those tobacco products and will assist individuals in their efforts to quit smoking  10 the center for disease control recognizes that a comprehensive multifaceted approach is necessary to adequately address the issue of youth tobacco use  11 due to federal preemption the city of reno lacked the legal authority to limit the display of tobacco

preventing the display of tobacco products or paraphernalia will reduce the number of adolescents who use tobacco products while still affording tobacco companies numerous ways to communicate product information and provide other advertising to their legal adult customers  18 reno city council desires to reduce adolescent smoking and the public health consequences of smoking without prohibiting the sale of tobacco paraphernalia to adult consumers  19 the purpose of this legislation is to further the strong governmental interest in protecting the health of its citizens and particularly its children by restricting sales to juveniles and the display of tobacco paraphernalia in retail environments that are open to children  and 20 this measure does not restrict expressive conduct any more than necessary and will leave tobacco companies with reasonable and adequate ways to communicate nonmisleading commercial information to their legal adult customers  11712 definitions as used in this

rationale 1 the purpose of these adult business regulations is to prevent crime protect the city tourist and retail trade maintain property values and preserve the quality of the citys neighborhoods commercial districts and urban life and permit reasonable alternative avenues of communication to prevent the proliferation of illegal sexrelated businesses similarly it is neither the intent nor effect of this code to restrict or deny access by adults to adult businesses protected by the first amendment  nor is it to suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment instead the intent is to enact a contentneutral ordinance which addresses the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses the predominant concern of these regulations is the limitation and prevention of the adverse secondary effects of the operation of adult businesses which manifest of minors to adult business activities and materials including in the form of exterior signage distraction to motorists harm to neighboring properties businesses and tourism spread of disease commission of crime and exacerbation of these effects by the clustering of adult businesses and allowance and use of alcohol on the premises of adult businesses 2 the provisions of these regulations have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communication including adult businessrelated materials or performances similarly it is neither the intent nor effect of these regulations to restrict or deny access by adults to adult businessrelated communication protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors exhibitors and performers of adult businessrelated communication to their intended market likewise the city seeks to assure adequate locations within the city of reno for the conduct of adult businesses and that regulations governing adult businesses are content neutral reasonable time place and manner regulations furthering the purpose of these regulations 3 based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of the operation of adult businesses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city council including findings and interpretations incorporated in multiple court cases and including multiple studies and reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around adult businesses 1  the city council finds i adult businesses as a category of commercial uses are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including but not limited to personal and property crimes prostitution potential spread of disease lewdness public indecency obscenity illicit drug use and drug trafficking negative impacts on surrounding properties urban blight exposure of minors to adult business activities and materials including in the form of exterior signage exposure of minors to alcohol and adverse secondary effects associated with adult businesses decrease in nearby property value in both commercial and residential areas economic vitality of nearby businesses litter and sexual assault and exploitation alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions thereby increasing the risk of and exacerbating adverse secondary effects ii adult businesses should be separated by suitable zoning location and reasonably spaced from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses iii each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing andor abating this substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects which is the citys rationale for this section of code exists independent of any comparative analysis between adult businesses and nonadult businesses in addition the citys interest in regulating adult businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future adult businesses that may locate in the city the city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this section of code are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects editors note 1 the city relies upon the following evidence of adverse secondary effects of adult business uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city council and on findings interpretations and narrowing constructions

purpose large retail establishments depend on high visibility from major public streets a large physical scale and a high volume of use by many residents and visitors as a consequence design of large retail establishments determines much of the character function and image of this community and its streetscapes and commercial areas the purpose of this section is to encourage large retail establishments and commercial center developments containing large retail establishments to contribute to reno as a unique place and to physically integrate with the community in a positive way the standards of this section supplement existing basic standards for development found elsewhere in this chapter these large scale retail establishment design standards promote a basic level of architectural variety and interest a compatible appearance and scale pedestrian and parking lot access orientation of buildings and entrances in relation to surrounding streets and mitigation of negative impacts from development of large retail establishments b applicability and exemptions 1 the standards of this apply to the following a new construction of a large retail establishment  b

effects when large retail establishments vacate their buildings and commercial centers many national retailers often abandon older outlets for new formats in new locations rather than reuse and redevelop existing buildings and centers vacant largeformat buildings tend to remain empty for many years causing blight and eroding nearby property values retailers often hang on to these empty buildings or in the case of leased sites continue to pay rent in order to prevent their competitors from occupying the locations accordingly these standards require new large retail establishment

subdivisions   water service   sewer service remedies a in addition to the provisions of enforcement violations and penalties the city has the following remedies 1 declaration of public nuisance every new structure building fill excavation or development located or maintained within any area of special flood hazard must comply with the firm in effect at the time the structure building fill excavation or development is permitted any new structure building fill excavation or development within any area of special flood hazard which is not in compliance with the governing firm is a public nuisance per se and may be abated prevented or restrained by action of the city 2 abatement of violations within 30 days of discovery of a violation of this ordinance the floodplain administrator may a request the property owner of the property upon which the violation exists to provide whatever additional information may required for their determination such information must be provided to the city within five days  andor b consider whether any application for a variance on file by the property owner is sufficient mitigation to withhold any further remedial action until the city makes a decision to grant or deny the variance the duty to consider the effects of an application for a variance shall be a continuing duty of the floodplain administrator at any time during the time that the variance application is being considered the floodplain administrator may take any remedial action allowable under the law he or she deems appropriate  andor c take any action to effect the abatement of such violations allowable under the law  andor d submit to the administrator of federal insurance administration a declaration for denial of insurance stating the property is in violation of a cited statute or ordinance pursuant to section 1316 of the national flood insurance act of 196 as amended  1984   62287   82394   102407 variances a nature of variances 1 a variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by ordinance 2 the variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 3 the need to protect the public from flooding is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance regulations provided in this ordinance are more detained and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternative other than a variance are more appropriate b in deciding whether to grant variances the city shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this ordinance and 1 the danger of materials being swept onto other lands and injuring others  2 the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 the cost of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges c procedure 1 the procedure for obtaining a variance shall be in accordance with title 18 annexation and land development administration and procedures common procedural requirement and zoning review and approval procedures where applicable d conditions 1 in addition to the considerations set forth in subsection b the city shall consider that a variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvements and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onhalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures considerations conditions and findings set forth in this ordinance have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing a the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood level during the based flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this ordinance for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city of reno need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposed but only to that elevation which the city of reno believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that subsection ad are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance with respect to nuisances in this article the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of the entire community or neighborhood or any considerable number of person or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use in the customary manner of any navigable lake or river bay stream canal or basin e findings 1 after consideration of the factors set forth in subsection b and the conditions set forth in subsection d to approve an application for a variance the city shall grant a variance upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b determination that failure to grant the variance would result in hardship to the applicant the hardship shall be exceptional unusual and peculiar to the property involved mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional inconvenience aesthetic considerations physical handicaps personal preferences or the disapproval of ones neighbor likewise cannot as a rule qualify as a hardship all of these problems can be resolved means without granting a variance even if the alternative is more expensive or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended c determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance conflict with existing local laws or ordinances or commit fraudvictimization on the public with respect to fraudvictimization the city will consider the fact and that every newly constructed building adds to government building responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years buildings permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increase risk of damage from floods while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs inconvenience danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring additionally future owners may be unaware of the risk potential to the property due to flood damage and the extremely high rates for flood insurance and d making of the findings set forth in as amended from time to time f upon consideration of all the factors and considerations and the purposes of this article the city may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article  102407 article xviii  wetlands and stream environment protection standards

riverfront design guidelines 1  purpose a these design guidelines provide guidance in terms of more subjective considerations such as district character design details or architectural style they are intended to assist the public developers and design professionals in determining the appearance of new development the design guidelines also serve as criteria for design review by the city staff advisory boards the planning commission and city council the major sections are as follows building form site improvements and landscaping signs and lighting b standards and guidelines for the riverfront district promote new buildings and renovations that create a gracious historical urban riverfront character services and entertainment market niche among other things the standards and guidelines require buildings to define the truckee rive esplanade and adjacent streets as attractive pedestrian spaces they prohibit blank building walls and parking areas from disrupting frontages and they require active groundfloor commercial uses in the districts core blocks aspects of the citys impressive architectural heritagethe riverside hotel the historic main post office the virginia street bridge the courthouse and others  should be used as contextual reference points for all new construction  22503 2  organization the guidelines are organized in order of increasing level of detail diagrams and other graphics are provided to illustrate application of the standards and guidelines these do not illustrate required buildings or other improvements however they do illustrate building and improvements that meet the standards and guidelines  22503 3  applicability of other law the city of reno master plan zoning redevelopment plan revitalization strategy for the downtown

americans with disabilities acts  22503 4  description of riverfront district the riverfront district is one of the city of renos most unique and important areas it is a showcase for the truckee river and it is the meeting ground that links the gaming and entertainment core to the north with the governmental and offices core to the south the riverfront district combines qualities of both adjacent areas to create a district that is lively yet civic in character  22503 figure a1 description of riverfront district 5  building design guidelines a form 1 the overall form of a building is a function of its threedimensional characteristics or massing discrete building masses should be defined and combined in different ways to create an interesting attractive composition for example a tall singular mass in the center of a building may be used to define the main entrance  recessed or projecting masses may be used to define building corners or to express interior building functions 2 in addition less dramatic forms of surface relief are recommended to add scale to building surfaces changes in roof line window groupings projected or recessed wall surfaces materials andor b storefronts andor building bays storefronts andor building bays should be a maximum of 30 feet and preferably 25 feet in width buildings with longer frontages should have a vertical architectural feature  column pier etc  every 25 to 30 feet to reflect the structural bay spacing c architectural features special architectural features such as turrets towers and loggias should be used to accent buildings at major street comers at the terminus of a street corridor lane or pedestrian way and at other highly visible district locations d other requirements every building should have a defined base a clear pattern of openings and surface features a recognizable entrance and an attractive roof line 1 building base this may be as subtle as a small projection of the wall surface combined with different material colors or as dramatic as a completely different composition and detailing of windows and doorways combined with different wall surface materials in general the building base should be approximately onethird the height of the building as indicated by the stepback standards under the height and setbacks standards in d trd truckee river corridor downtown riverfront special purpose district the base for buildings in the riverfront district can be designed to incorporate only ground level storefronts or up to three floors of space figure a2 building facade design 2 openings and surface features windows wall panels pilasters and the buildings structural bay spacing features should be carried across windowless walls to relieve blank uninteresting surfaces 3 building entrances building entrances should be prominent and easy to identify a main building entrances and lobbies should be easily identifiable and distinguishable from first floor storefronts at least two of the following treatments are recommended 1 marked by a taller mass above such as a tower or within a volume that protrudes or is notched or recessed within the building surface  2 located in the center of the facade as part of a symmetrical overall composition  3 accented by architectural elements such as columns overhanging roofs awnings and ornamental light fixtures  4 marked or accented by a change in the roof line or change in the roof type b along active ground level commercial frontages entries to businesses shops or b lobbies should be located a maximum of 50 feet apart c corner buildings should provide prominent corner entrances for shops lobbies and other activitygenerating uses figure a3 building design guidelines 4 roofs and roof lines roofs and roof lines should provide visual interest and should complement the overall facade composition roofs of historic commercial buildings should be used as an inspiration for new designs flat roofs are acceptable if a strong attractively detailed cornice andor parapet wall is provided a parapet walls should have a distinct shape or profile eg a gable arc or raised center b commercial mansards ie wraparound roofing panels that do not enclose a habitable floor should not be used c accent elements such as cutout openings grilles and latticework reliefs or ornamental medallions are recommended d mechanical equipment on rooftops should be screened preferably behind a parapet roof latticework louvered panels and other treatments that are compatible with the buildings architecture may also be appropriate e storefronts storefronts are like small buildings with their own base roof line and pattern of window and door openings figure a4 storefront design 1 base a face panel of stone precast concrete tile or other special material is recommended below display windows materials recommended for walls are generally suitable base materials should be the same or heavier materials visually than walls ceramic tile is frequently used as a storefront base 2 display windows large pane windows encompassing a minimum of 60 percent of the storefront surface area are recommended where privacy is desired for restaurants professional services etc windows should be divided into smaller panes 3 clerestory windows clerestory windows are horizontal panels of glass between the storefront and the second floor they are a traditional element of main street buildings and are recommended for all new or renovated commercial storefronts clerestory windows can be good locations for neon paintedwindow andor other relatively nonobtrusive types of signs 4 recessed entries recessed entries are recommended as another traditional element of the main street storefront recommended treatments include a special paving materials such as ceramic tile  b ornamental ceilings such as coffering  c decorative light fixtures 5 doors doors should be substantial and well detailed they are the one part of the storefront that patrons will invariably touch and feel they should match the materials design and character of the display window framing narrow line aluminum frame doors must not be used f side and rear building facades side and rear building facades should have a level of trim and finish compatible with the front facade particularly if they are visible from streets adjacent parking areas or residential buildings g blank wall areas blank wall areas without windows or doors are only permitted on internal block sideproperty line walls such blank walls should reflect the ground level building increment building massing and organization and facade compositions guidelines e1 e5 above surface reliefs decorative vines andor architectural murals public art and other surface enhancements should also be considered h wall surface materials 1 if the building mass and pattern of windows and doors is complex simple wall surfaces are preferable eg stucco  if the building volume and the pattern of wall openings is simple additional wall texture and articulation should be employed eg bricks or blocks rusticated stucco ornamental reliefs in both cases pilasters columns and cornices should be used to add visual interest and pedestrian scale 2 the palette of wall materials should be kept to a minimum preferably two eg brick and granite or three at the most using the same wall materials as adjacent or nearby buildings helps strengthen the district character a brick  reds redbrowns or yellowbrowns are recommended b stone and stone veneers  are appropriate as a basic building material or as a special material for walls sills or base concrete c precast concrete  options in terms of form work pigments and aggregates should be explored to create rich surfaces accents such as ceramic tile or stone are recommended for decorative effect d ceramic tile  is recommended as an accent material e note on parapet and cornice cap flashings sheet metal parapet cap flashings should be painted to match wall or trim color select a minimum to avoid oil canning distortion in the metal as follows 24 gauge galvanized steel  26 gauge stainless steel  inch aluminum  16 ounce copper f not appropriate 1 simulated finishes  such as artificial stone 2 wood  shingles shakes clapboard or plywood siding 3 concrete or splitface block  unless used on far sides or rear elevations concrete or splitface block is not appropriate on adjoining street frontages i windows windows are an important element of building composition and an indicator of overall building quality 1 windowtowall proportion in general upper stories should have a window to wall area proportion typically 30 to 50 percent that is smaller than that of ground floor storefronts 2 window openings window openings should generally be vertical or square in shape  if openings are horizontal windows andor windowpanes should be square or vertical in shape 3 window inset window inset glass should be inset a minimum of three inches from the exterior wall surface to add relief to the wall surface  this is especially important for stucco buildings 4 shaped frames and sills shaped frames and sills should be used to enhance openings and add additional relief they should be proportional to the glass area framed  eg a larger window should have thicker framing members 5 muntins true divided light windows or sectional windows are recommended where a divided window design is desired  snapin grilles or muntins are discouraged 6 glazing clear glazing is strongly recommended reflective glazing should not be used if tinted glazing is used the tint should be kept as light as possible  green grey and blue are recommended 7 replacementrenovation replacementrenovation  wood windows should be replaced with wood windows of the same operating type eg doublehung casement etc  vinylcovered wood windows are available for lower maintenance if aluminum replacement windows or doors are used they should be a same operating type and orientation as the original windows eg do not replace a double hung window with a horizontal sliding window b factory painted or fluorocoated to match the original  color anodized is also acceptable c similar in size and thickness to the original frame and mullions figure a5 window design j roof design and materials roofs should match the principal building in terms of style detailing and materials they should also contribute expressive and interesting forms that add to the overall character of the district and are attractive when viewed from surrounding areas experimental severe andor nontraditional roof lines or materials should not be used recommended roof materials are 1 clay ceramic or concrete tile clay ceramic or concrete tile  colorful glazed ceramic tiles are recommended for decorative roof shapes such as parapets domes and turrets 2 metal seam roofing metal seam roofing should be anodized fluorocoated or painted copper and lead roofs should be natural or oxidized 3 flat tar and gravel composition or elastomeric roofs flat tar and gravel composition or elastomeric roofs should be screened by builtup cornices parapets or falsefront sections of sloping roof figure a6 roof design k awnings trellises canopies and accessories 1 awnings awnings are recommended and subject to redevelopment agency staff review and approval they should be a colorful fabric that complements and does not detract from the building design awnings should be mounted over a metal structural that is framed and attractive in design fabric awnings are generally preferable to permanent canopies backlit awnings are prohibited 2 trellises and canopies materials colors and form should be derived from the building architecture 3 height and projection trellises canopies and awnings valances should be a minimum of seven feet above the sidewalk and project no more than seven feet out from the building wall 4 placement placement of trellises canopies and awnings should be above the display windows and below the storefront cornice or sign panel they should not cover piers pilasters clerestory windows or other architectural features an individual awning or canopy for each storefront or building bay complements the building more effectively than one continuous awning does 5 accessories ornamental brackets and poles add interest hanging flower or plant baskets suspended from ornamental brackets of metal or wood are recommended for storefronts l color in keeping with the formal yet lively character desired for the riverfront district color for trim awnings and other accessories should accent and contrast wall color  for example neutral or light wall colors with darker saturated hues for trim or warm brick colors with light trim 1 secondary color secondary color can be used to give additional emphasis to architectural features such as building bases columns cornices capitals and bands 2 bright colors bright colors should be used sparingly to allow display windows and merchandise to catch the eye and stand out in the visual field typical applications are fabric awnings banners window frames andor special architectural details  22503 6  site improvement design guidelines a paving materials paving materials recommended for pedestrian surfaces are listed below in general a maximum of two materials should be combined in a single application 1 stone such as slate or granite 2 brick 3 concrete unit pavers 4 pouredinplace concrete with any of the following treatments integral pigment color  special aggregate  special scoring pattern  ornamental insets such as tile all concrete walks should be tinted to reduce glare b walls fences and piers walls fences and piers should be used to define public and private spaces and screen parking areas 1 design walls fences and piers should be designed to reflect the architectural style and materials of the principal buildings a along streets and walks walls and fences should be low and open to maintain an open character and retain visibility maximum height for wall and fence panels should be 42 inches maximum height for columns and piers should be 54 inches excluding luminaires signs and other appurtenances b fences and wall panels should be divided into regular modules that relate to the architectural module of the principal buildings c a combination of thick and thin structural elements  should be used with thicker elements for supports andor panel divisions fence posts andor support columns may be built up with additional trim cornices andor moldings for this purpose d walls and piers should have a base and coping see wall and fence composition diagram e piers  a row of freestanding piers can be effective as an open screen between parking areas and streets or walks a continuous chain or open metal fence attached between piers can be an attractive device for creating a stronger separation 1 spacing no more than ten feet on center 2 thickness at least 18 inches per side or diameter 3 height at least 36 inches and no taller than 54 inches f riverfront flood walls and retaining walls are highly visible from the esplanade truckee river bridges and adjacent buildings they should be designed as attractive architectural elements traditional approaches to detailing should be employed to reflect the design of the riverfronts attractive older buildings and flood walls  eg wall segments should be divided into panels by regularly spaced pilasters and base and topcornice panels 2 materials materials should be the same as or compatible with those of the principal buildings support post or pier materials may differ from fence materials  eg metal fence panels combined with masonry piers a fences should be made of wrought iron cast iron and welded steel for commercial applications metal fences may be mounted on a low masonry wall andor spanning masonry piers wood fences should not be used metal fences should generally be painted either black or dark green b walls and piers should be made of precast concrete andor stuccofaced concrete or concrete block brick or stone c not recommended 1 chain link  if used chain link should be coated with nylon preferably of a dark color and used in combination with heavy masonry piers or ornamental metal posts 2 unfinished or unsurfaced concrete block walls  should not be used 3 rustic wood fences figure a7 walks walls and piers c surface grading surface grading should be minimized to maintain a formal and traditional character of development the following guidelines are recommended 1 sheet drainage from building to parking areas and perimeter roadways  2 no cross slopes in excess of two percent for landscaped or walk areas optimum slope for paved areas is one and onehalf percent depending on roughness of paving surface 3 mounting earth to elevate buildings or berming earth against the side of buildings is not recommended d the esplanade 1 the esplanade must service a variety of different purposes  shopping strolling outdoor dining low speed bicycling and just sitting in the sum it must be a publicly owned and accessible setting that showcases the truckee river and adjacent buildings to best effect while placing emphasis on the rich historical components found along the river corridor and accommodate special events andor emergency access vehicles as needed a design that is simple flexible and elegant is needed to reflect the riverfront districts rich architectural heritage and history 2 the elements listed below are recommended as part of the esplanade design whether the esplanade is developed by the city of reno directly or with developers as part of new private development projects the sketch plan figure a8 esplanade furnishings illustrates the recommended design concept a crosssection a minimum width of 25 feet as measured from the face of the riverfront retaining wall is recommended as noted elsewhere this 25foot area should be organized according to functions listed below and illustrated by the concept plan below 1 storefront displaydining zone a public area a minimum of six feet in width should be established adjacent to the building frontage this area would be used for windowshopping and subject to the redevelopment agencys review and approval outdoor dining merchandise displays and sidewalk sales 2 central promenade an area a minimum of 12 feet in width shall be reserved in the center of the esplanade for strolling lowspeed bicycling special events and emergency vehicle access 3 furnishings zone an area a minimum of six feet in width adjacent to the river edge should be reserved for shade tree benches trash receptacles andor other furnishings as set forth below 4 river edge fencewall an area approximately one foot in width should be reserved for an attractive fencewall with integral pedestrian lighting b paving pattern and materials patterns should be form and materials simple  a maximum of three materials should be used in combination patterns and materials should reflect the three major functional areas described above a largescale yet subtle pattern is recommended for the central promenade  material should be scored tinted concrete a smallerscale pattern andor material is recommended as a border for use in the displaydining and furnishings zones  material should be concrete or granite pavers brick or scored concrete c furnishings furnishings should be civil in appearance heavyduty in construction and arranged to reflect the formal qualities desired for the esplanade it is recommended that benches trash receptacles lighting and trees be arranged to create a series of defined sitting areas open unfurnished areas should be created at regular intervals to allow for groups to stand adjacent to the fencewall for set of special exhibits and displays and for additional maneuvering room for vehicles recommended furnishings are show on the graphic it is also recommended that public art be incorporated into furnishings whenever possible d trees and lighting deciduous shade trees and pedestrianscale lighting should be installed at regular intervals to create a formal esplanade edge lights should be installed at a relatively narrow spacing to create a wellilluminated nighttime environment it is recommended that trees and lights alternate every 20 feet  ie trees would be located at 40 feet on the center and lights would be located at 40 feet on center e river edge fencewall the virginia street bridge should serve as the model for design of the fencewall along the river edge regularly spaced concrete pilasters and a continuous base should frame ornamental metal fence panels pilasters should be detailed and serve as basis for the esplanade lighting the railing design employed for the virginia street bridge should be used throughout the esplanade  22503 figure a8 esplanade furnishings 7  landscaping design guidelines a because the riverfront district is one of the citys most visible and highlydeveloped areas plant materials should be colorful and sized for immediate effect  eg trees should be installed at a minimum 36inch box andor threeinch caliper size b plant materials along streets should create an attractive and harmonious character in keeping with the downtown location 1 street trees should be planted between sidewalks and roadways to create a buffer between pedestrians and automobiles consistency in tree species tree size and spacing should be used to reinforce a strong street identity and character 2 trees with open branching structures should be used deciduous trees are recommended 3 plantinglandscapes areas should have a simple palette of plant species 4 complex planting scheme should not be used in front yard areas 5 plant materials that exhibit annual or seasonal color are recommended to highlight special locations such as main building entrances and entrance walks c plant materials in other urban locations should be selected and placed to reflect both ornamental and functional characteristics 1 deciduous trees should be the predominant large plant material used they should be located adjacent to buildings and within parking areas to provide shade in summer and allow sun in winter species should be selected to provide fall color and to minimize litter and other maintenance problems 2 evergreen shrubs and trees should be used as a screening device along rear property lines not directly adjacent to residences around mechanical appurtenances and to obscure grillwork and fencing associated with subsurface parking garages 3 flowering shrubs and trees should be used where they can be most appreciated adjacent to walks and recreational areas or as a frame for building entrances stairs and walks 4 flowers with annual or seasonal color are recommended to highlight special locations such as courtyards building entrances or access drives d native riparian species and arrangements should be used in riveredge areas where earthen banks rather than flood walls define the river channel species should be informal in appearance and open in form to maintain views to the river e surface parking lots utilize a significant amount of site area and should be designed as an integral feature of the overall site development plan 1 spacedefining elements such as trellises columns walls arbors and hedges should be provided to enhance the appearance of lots these elements should be consistent in design and materials with the principal buildings and other site features 2 orchard parking should be employed in all surface lots trees shall be planted toward the rear of parking stalls to create a grid rather than rows at a ratio of one tree per three cars the orchard tree placement provides better shade on the passenger compartment and more even shade and vegetation throughout the parking area  22503 8  sign design guidelines a location and size location and size are subject to redevelopment agency review and approval 1 signs should be mounted on parapets towers turrets recessed wall areas and other architectural features specifically designed for them flushmounted and painted wall signs should align with major architectural elements such as doors and windows ornamental elements such as moldings pilasters arches clerestory windows roof eaves or cornice lines should be used as a frame 2 signs should not span cornice or eave lines however signs designed as an extension of the architectural form of the building may be appropriate for example projecting signs signboards or neon signs may be designed to look like a marquee parapet or accent to a parapet or sloped roof 3 signs should be in proportion to the size of building they identify the sum total of buildingmounted signs excluding window signs used to identify an individual use should not exceed one square foot of area for each linear foot of the building frontage occupied by that use b architectural design 1 sign shapes type styles and color combinations should complement building styles in the riverfront district it is recommended that buildings have a formal character and signs project a complementary look

 with single or multiple spotlights provided light sources are shielded to protect motorists pedestrians and adjacent properties c color and lamp type  light sources providing the most pleasing and accurate color rendering are metal halide incandescent and colorcorrected fluorescent other lamp types such as cool white fluorescent mercury vapor and high and low pressure sodium may distort sign

design guidelines the following skyway design guidelines are adopted in order to provide design standards for skyways these guidelines may be amended only after a public hearing by the planning commission and adoption of a resolution by the city council 1  purpose and intent skyways provide an opportunity to increase the economic viability of a project the short block lengths that exist in downtown reno make it difficult to provide largescale projects to strengthen renos economy in addition properly designed skyways may provide for improved traffic flow increased pedestrian safety and increased pedestrian comfort finally skyways provide an additional revenue source for the city of reno these skyway design guidelines are intended to cover normal situations encountered in design it is expected that architectural and engineering considerations will arise which are not completely covered therefore any items or situations not anticipated in the guidelines will be designed in accordance with accepted architectural and engineering practices and appropriate codes and ordinances it is anticipated that unusual or extraordinary situations will arise given the complexities involved in such cases the administrator may authorize alternative standards provided that any alternative standard meets the intent or are the equivalent of the skyway design guidelines and are in accordance with accepted architectural and engineering practices meeting the requirements of this section does not guarantee approval of a skyway the burden of proof is on the applicant to demonstrate that a skyway is essential for the project and meets or exceeds the design guidelines the purpose of the following document is to provide the technical basis for the review of skyways provided for under of of this title and to provide design professionals with criteria intended to promote orderly development and integration of skyway structures into new or existing built environments where specific quantitative standards are presented they shall be treated as minimums that can only be proposed for change with explicit justification in the projects special use permit application skyways offer innovative solutions for creating new space in the highdensity downtown urban core or offering safe access to land separated by rightsofway in other suburban areas these guidelines recognize that bridging over rightsofway can be problematic the criteria here represent a foundation of what is to be expected from the design professional in maintaining continuity of quality of skyway projects these guidelines serve as a baseline for the thoughtful evolvement of skyways 2  participation property frontage percentage for skybuildings if a property is located in an area identified as appropriate for skybuildings a property owners who has gained control over an entire block or the majority of a block and still needs more land for expansion may need to link two or more blocks to achieve economic benefit if 75 percent of the street frontage property owners of a block proposed for a skyway agree to the proposal then it can be assumed that the applicant has met finding 10d of e a total of 75 percent participation is defined as a minimum of 75 percent of the total street frontage counting both sides of the street example if the street frontage of the block is 300 feet long then the participating property frontage percentage requirement would be 300 feet plus 300 feet for a total of 600 feet x 75% or 450 feet of street frontage 3  railroad corridor for the purposes of this section the following definitions apply a downtown railroad corridor the area adjacent to and including the southern pacific railroad rightofway and the air space above it with a width equal to the distance from the north boundary of the rightofway for third street between sierra street and arlington avenue and the south boundary of the rightofway for commercial row between virginia street and sierra street and bounded on the east and west by the boundaries of the redevelopment area b interior railroad tunnel the area within which the southern pacific railroad tracks are entirely enclosed on both sides and above and not visible from adjacent public areas including streets sidewalks or other properties the terminus of the tunnel at each end for a minimum depth of 20 feet visible from adjacent streets and sidewalks shall be excluded from this provision to ensure that an aesthetic treatment compatible with the exterior is provided 4  architectural compatibility architectural compatibility is the most important element of the design guidelines healthy growing cities are constantly evolving and architectural creativity should not be restricted if the city is to experience orderly development encouragement of design compatibility with adjacent land based structures will help to ensure diversity and interest in the structures that are built restricting design to rigid criteria could lead to cookie cutter structures where one corner or area looks much like the one two blocks away each skyway setting will undoubtedly be unique in character and scale in a touristoriented market where creative competition for patron interest is important many architectural styles will develop contemporaryfuturistic historical classical as well as whimsical and fantasy styles may need to coexist 5  street level activity opportunity and public space a human activity at street level is vital to the atmosphere of a city in order to encourage this activity facade improvements beneath skybuildings are required specifically an architectural facade change that includes recessed sections is required every 25 lineal feet of building frontage on a block that includes a skybuilding additionally transparent openings into a public commercial space are also required every 75 lineal feet adjacent to the rightofway or a public space this is considered a minimum standard unless the skyway design includes both a functional basis for the deviation and the applicant demonstrates that the proposed design is pedestrian friendly given the particular context this area should provide opportunity for commercial and public activity such as street vendors project entrances street furniture and focal points for architectural features or public art b in order to encourage street level activity and maintain open space at the intersections which will provide more light and air a public space requirement for skybuildings attached to new terminus buildings is established outside at ground level skybuildings attached to new terminus buildings require a  ratio of skybuilding square footage area to additional ground level public space outside the rightofway within the same block and located at the corners of the building in order to provide open space that helps replace the admittance of light and air that may be eliminated by the skybuilding if the property owner can demonstrate that it is impossible to provide additional public space at the corner then the public space setback may be used to provide wider sidewalks under the skybuilding or some other design solution such as a porte cohere private driveway the additional public space applies to that portion of the terminus building that is a minimum of 20 feet or below the skybuilding whichever is higher the portion of the terminus building that is below the skybuilding at a minimum 20 feet may cantilever back out to its permitted setback figure b1 figure b1 public space requirement c within the downtown railroad corridor the design review committee shall determine the appropriate requirement of ground level public space in relation to skybuilding square footage area in lieu of the  public space to skybuilding area requirement d when a skyway is proposed to be located closer than 25 feet from the nearest rightofway excluding alleys then in addition to the landscaping and screening provisions stated in of additional landscaping shall be provided on the roof cantilevered over the facade or a combination of both the additional landscaping should be designed to soften the effect of the structure that will be located next to the open space provided at the intersections 6  design a a primary objective of the recommendations given throughout this text is to achieve continuity in the design of new skybuildings constructed between existing or new building facades often the skyway will infill between two parallel building frontages these buildings may have been designed during different architectural or historical periods and thus when compared are unique and distinctly different the degree of difference which exists between any given building will require an equal degree of effort to design a skyway which will visually connect the supporting buildings exterior facades effort should be made to incorporate facade improvements on both buildings that will receive a connecting skyway so that they will have complementary facades before the skyway is constructed b skyway design must meet ada building code and fire additionally skyway design shall meet nfpa 502 199 as amended c steps to achieve continuity include a careful analysis of the architectural components that comprise the facades under consideration within any building elevation there will be design elements that predominate and visually suggest the overall character of the building these elements should be considered as the fundamental design components design components include the following 1 building massing 2 roof linescornices 3 facadebreakuprhythm 4 wall surface materials texture and decorative elements 5 fenestration windows 6 door openings 7 color 8 lighting 9 bridge support structures and services d when designing the exterior facade for skyways include design components found on the exterior of the adjacent supporting buildings in most cases these architectural components will not exist on both buildings because of this it is important to select design components for the skyway and connecting buildings which will be the most effective in creating a cohesive project with an overall appearance of integrity skyways should also be designed to be compatible with the historical architectural patterns and elements of the block in which they are to reside whatever design components are used to bridge two buildings it is imperative that the designer uses the best visual sensibility and continuity for example if both buildings contain vertical columns then the skyway design should also include vertical columns or if one building contains vertical columns vertical columns might be added to both the existing building and the proposed skyway 7  building massing a the overall massing of the skyway shall be harmonious with the buildings that form terminals at each end skyway design must reduce the tunnel effect which gives the impression of entering a tunnel in an effort to reduce or eliminate the tunnel effect unless explicit justification is presented in the applicants special use permit application to deviate from this standard all skyways shall maintain a 20foot minimum clearance above the rightofway where only new structures are involved the 20foot clearance is viewed as a true minimum unless particularly unique circumstances are present this clearance will reduce the narrow separation between the street and the bottom of the skyway that is typical of the existing skyways which may appear to have a tunnel effect in order to encourage greater clearances skyway design shall include a  ratio of clear height between the rightofway and the skyway to overall height of the skyway structure for example if a skyway is 20 feet above the rightofway then the skyway structure height shall be limited to 20 feet overall height if however a 22foot tall skyway structure is desired then the minimum height above the rightofway shall be 22 feet figure b2 figure b2 skyway clearance guidelines b within the downtown railroad corridor the design review committee shall determine the appropriate proportion of skybuilding height to clear height above the interior railroad tunnel in lieu of the maximum ratio of  of required skybuilding to street opening or clearance below c the width of a skyway is another contributing factor of tunnel effect in order to reduce the impact that width has on this phenomenon a skybuildings underside facades and lighting shall receive particular attention to details where permitted skybuildings may not cover more than 80 percent of the area between two streets with particular attention being given to conserving open space at the intersections the downtown railroad corridor is exempted from the 80 percent maximum coverage no skybuildings may be placed over the intersection of two streets skybuildings may require setbacks from intersecting streets to address reno fire department requirements andor air and light needs for pedestrians and the streetscape applicants should meet with the fire department early in the design process to establish its needs d the 30foot maximum width for pedestrian skywalks should reduce the appearance of a massive bulk above the rightofway which is typical of wider skybuildings the use of roof top or cantilevered landscaping is encouraged to soften the effect of the skyway especially if the proposed skyway will be closer than 25 feet from the rightofway e lighting is a key factor to reduce the tunnel effect to this end the lighting beneath a skybuilding should be brighter during daylight hours and softer during hours of darkness additionally the ceiling should be illuminated to reduce the contrast between the recessed lights and the dark ceiling ideally the ceiling will be illuminated indirectly with uplighting for a strong architectural effect specific recommendations are given in the lighting section 8  roof linecornices for the most part roof lines on commercial building structures are flat with parapets on the other hand cornice elements can be diverse and occur at tops of buildings or midpoints cornices can be very dominant elements that create strong definitions of the beginning and end portions of a building and as such must be used thoughtfully when using cornices overall design must create an artful blending of the two buildings with the skyway for instance if a unique roof line or cornice found on supporting building a is incorporated onto the facade of the connecting skyway it will be necessary to develop a portion of this same component on supporting building b continuation of architectural components on both buildings provides smooth transition between structures 9  facadebreakuprhythm in order to break up the monotony of the facade the design must incorporate architectural features of the supporting buildings to the skyway facades the skyway should be consistent from one side of the structure to the other to ensure a continuity of look feel and balance continuity of style should also include a combination of motifs using horizontal as well as vertical elements color texture lighting etc 10  wall surface materials and texture reno has many examples of traditional uses of brick materials should this material be incorporated onto a skyway it must appear to be structural masonry a designer should also consider how natural and artificial light plays upon the wall and ceiling surfaces of the structure if depth of surface is desired this may be achieved with color contrasts material contrasts applied or structural elements that create shadow vertical or horizontal reveals and any other design element that will eliminate a blank wall effect the existing surface materials and textures of the terminus buildings must be incorporated onto the skyway facades if the existing materials or textures on the existing buildings are dissimilar and visually conflicting then the use of a neutral existing material or texture found on either terminus building should help ease the transition the finish materials on the exterior should complement the character of the connecting buildings 11  windows a this component has many elements that define its appearance it includes but is not be limited to frame type directional orientation whether it is more vertical or horizontal or otherwise glass type spacing and trim the complexity of this component together with the possibility that the supporting buildings may have dissimilar fenestration necessitates considering a number of schemes to create continuity b in order to allow pedestrians and drivers to see into the skyways a minimum transparency is required 25 percent minimum transparency is required for skybuildings figure b3 in order to ensure see  windows or transparent sections these transparent windows or sections shall be made of material that has a minimum of 52 percent visual light transmittance with a six percent maximum visual light reflectance pedestrian skywalks and skytrams shall maintain at least 70 percent for all skytrams and for skywalks greater than 20 feet in width or 50 percent for skywalks less than or equal to 20 feet in width transparent windows or sections depending on the width of the skywalk or skytram in any case the transparent windows or sections shall maintain the same minimum 52 percent visual light transmittance and maximum six percent visual light reflectance as skybuildings transparency for skytrams takes into consideration the overall height of structure with the skytram in place if it is not an enclosed structure credit will be given for the open portion of the overall height c if there is extreme diversity in the two buildings windows a fenestration system for the skyway may be a composite of both buildings window types skyway fenestration may be a simplified interpretation suggesting rather than replicating the supporting buildings fenestration 12  door openings streetsidewalk access and exit to and from skybuildings and pedestrian skyways must be apparent and inviting to the public two way access to skyways located within a building should not exceed 50 feet of travel from the exterior face of the building to the point of entry to the skyway vertical access where practical the sidewalk access should be transparent so that the skyway access point is clearly visible from the sidewalk and is identified by signage that is also clearly visible and readable from the sidewalk skyway access must meet ada building code and fire if a skyway is closed for any reason a sign displaying the hours of the closure must be located at the ground floor level entrance to the skyway 13  color in order to lessen the effect of being in a tunnel pale offwhites or light colors should comprise the majority of solid surfaces colors used closer to the street level should be lighter in color because this will appear to lift the structure corporate colors should be limited and used as an accent color 14  lighting a interior lighting seen skywalk and skytram fenestration shall be inconspicuous nonglare nonanimated and cannot pose a traffic hazard interior lighting seen fenestration in the downtown area overlay district shall be inconspicuous nonglare and may be animated provided it is not deemed to be a traffic hazard access corridor lighting to the skyway shall be brighter than the skyway lighting to provide better visibility when lighting is used as a design element it should be used consistently throughout the project including the skyway lighting of the skyway should be designed in harmony and balance with the entire structure lighting which adds importance or prominence to the skyway is not permitted if it could make the skyway become a distraction or cause confusion to pedestrian or vehicular traffic ie flashing glaring lighting must be avoided figure b3 skybuilding transparency b exterior lighting and indirect surface lighting on the exterior of the skyway is acceptable and encouraged so that skyway structures will not look like heavy dark shapes in the night sky the ceiling beneath the skyway must be lighted either directly or indirectly indirect lighting use of uplighting is recommended the exterior lighting should reduce the contrast between the lights installed to illuminate the rightofway beneath the skyway and the dark ceiling lighting of the rightofway beneath a skybuilding is required this lighting shall maintain a minimum of 30 footcandle of light during daylight hours and ten foot candle of light during hours of darkness measured at three feet above grade metal halide lights are required c where possible natural lighting should be used in addition to external nonglare and inconspicuous artificial light to mitigate possible tunnel effects below the skyways 15  bridge support structure and services a bridge support structures that support the skyway at either end should be contained within the terminus buildings or incorporated into the design of pedestrian ways or sidewalks if the support structures are to be located within the rightofway then the developer shall first obtain an encroachment permit or shall abandon the rightofway at the citys discretion and shall replace the lost rightofway at a  ratio for the entire support structure including footings the rightofway replacement shall be located on the same street frontage as the skyway ideally the support structures will be offset with an area for a wider sidewalk andor space for a porte cochere in any case additional public space should be designed so that it will not become unused space that is unattractive to pedestrians b within the downtown railroad corridor the design review committee shall determine the appropriate proportion of rightofway encroachment to replacement of public space in lieu of the ratio of  of required rightofway encroachment to rightofway replacement c skyway support structures shall be screened and shielded from view unless they are integral to the design the design of support structures should be architecturally stimulating and comprised of architectural columns or public art for example d bridge services are defined as those electrical and mechanical systems that exhaust airborne pollutants and provide electrical service to exterior lights necessary for safe passage below the skyway if necessary mechanical ventilation of the area below skyway shall be installed a carbon monoxide control system shall be required unless the designer can demonstrate or tests that carbon monoxide will not be a hazard ventilation and lighting of the public space covered by skyways shall be powered and metered independently so as to provide for continuous service to the public at large skyways must not interfere or impair use of the public rightofway by existing or proposed communication and utility facilities e skyways shall be designed to meet all streetlight and traffic signal requirements and the rightofway beneath the skyway shall be designed so that traffic is not impeded in order to minimize accumulated exhaust buses taxis and delivery vehicles will not be permitted to idle beneath skyways f roof drainage systems shall provide yearround continuous drainage to adjoining building systems or to the storm sewer and shall operate independent of the operation of the attached buildings 16  support structures for detached vertical access to pedestrian skywalks and skytrams support structures for detached vertical access to pedestrian skywalks and skytrams must meet the setbacks required in the zone in which they are located these structures must also meet the minimum requirements for transparency and should be designed to minimize the appearance of visual clutter beside the roadway these structures must also meet ada fire building code requirements 17  signs a signage should not dominate the skyway facade rather it should complement the existing buildings and overall design of the skyway signage shall also be proportional to the scale of the skyway structure outside the downtown core area signs shall be limited to one corporate logo or one company name per side in addition to directional signs required by the city andor permitted by the administrator b in the downtown redevelopment area skyways should use signs in a manner that complements the architecture and sign design of the primary structures in scale proportion colors and materials signs should not create hazardous conditions for motorists due to excessive glare or animated signs or other obstructions the quality and designarchitectural relationship of signs is more important than the amount or quantity of signs all skyway signs should generally be of a permanent rather than temporary nature eg banners banners or seasonal material such as christmas decorations should be durable and of high quality c reader boards are prohibited because they could interfere with traffic 18  design review committee a a design review committee shall review skyway proposals b the design review committee shall be comprised of the following principal voting members 1 one recommended by the nevada the american planning association  and 2 one recommended by the nevada the american institute of architects  and 3 one recommended by the nevada the american society of landscape architects  and 4 one recommended by the planning commission  and 5 one recommended by the citizens advisory committee for the redevelopment agency each of the above shall also recommend an alternate the alternate will be a voting member when the principal member is absent c the design review committee drc will review skyway plans to ensure a public perspective is provided related to conformance with the intent of the skyway design guidelines it is recommended that an applicant hold a preapplication hearing with the drc prior to formal submittal of a major special use permit application prior to appearing before the planning commission the skyway plans and drawings will be presented to the drc for their formal review  92600   13008 table of
