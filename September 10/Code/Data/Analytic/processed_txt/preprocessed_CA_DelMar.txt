scope of provisions of this apply to the construction of new structures and to the alteration of existing structures as specified in this policy a it is the policy of the city that all public and private users of water within the city shall use such water for reasonable purposes and in a reasonable and conscientious effort to conserve water b while this not require some construction and structural alteration projects to meet the requirements herein these requirements should still be considered as recommended for conserving water c the city council may initiate and maintain education programs to encourage the conservation of water   conservation practices no person shall knowingly use water or permit the use of water supplied by the city for residential commercial industrial agricultural governmental or any other purpose in a manner which does not reflect sound conservation practices the following general guidelines are recommended to promote reasonable use of water a

by a level below the drought reduction levels plus an additional 20 percent as a user can meet the previously defined criteria their sewage discharge assumptions will be lowered to the current water demands adding back any water savings required under the drought requirements as an example if the drought reductions are 20 percent and the user drops their water consumption by 45 percent then the

during demand managementdrought conditions wastewater customers are billed for sewer service based on their water usage during drought periods water usage will decline and threaten the fiscal stability of the wastewater utility therefore during drought periods wastewater charges will be calculated based on the assumption that sewer usage is the same as the commensurate month from the last nondrought fiscal year drought sewer charges will be lifted after one full year of nondrought consumption records can be established a residential sewer discharges will be estimated based on the assumed sewage usage during the last nondrought year b commercial sewer discharges will be estimated based on 90 percent of the water usage during the last nondrought year a user may petition to have their sewer discharge water usage assumption lowered if their annual water demand drops below their nondrought water demands by a level below the drought reduction levels plus an additional 20 percent as a user can meet the previously defined criteria their sewage discharge assumptions will be lowered to the current water demands adding back any water savings required under the drought requirements as an example if the drought reductions are 20 percent and the user drops their water consumption by 45 percent then the resulting sewer will be calculated based on 120 percent of the current water consumption c fairgrounds sewer commodity charges during drought conditions will be calculated based on the greater of 1 the rolling average of the same bimonthly period from the last three fiscal

rtcip   title this be known as the del mar regional transportation congestion improvement program rtcip       findings in adopting this the city council of the city of del mar finds and determines that a the city is a member agency of the san diego association of governments sandag a joint powers agency consisting of the city the county of san diego and the 17 other cities situated in san diego county acting in concert the member agencies of sandag acting in their capacity as the san diego county regional transportation commission developed a plan whereby the shortfall in funds needed to enlarge the capacity of the regional system of highways and arterials in san diego county the regional arterial system could be made up in part by a transportation uniform mitigation fee on future residential development as a member agency of sandag the city participated in the preparation of a certain rtcip impact fee nexus study dated  the nexus study prepared pursuant to california government et seq the mitigation fee act b the city council has been informed and advised and finds that future development within san diego county and the cities therein will result in traffic volumes exceeding the capacity of the regional arterial system as it presently exists c the city council has been further informed and advised and finds that if the capacity of the regional arterial system is not enlarged the result will be substantial traffic congestion in all parts of san diego county and the city with unacceptable levels of service throughout san diego county by 2030 d the city council has been further advised and so finds that funding in addition to those fees adopted pursuant to the nexus study will be inadequate to fund construction of the regional arterial system absent implementation of a regional transportation improvement plan rtcip fee based on the nexus study existing and known future funding sources will be inadequate to provide necessary improvements to the regional arterial system resulting in an unacceptably high level of traffic congestion within and around san diego county and the city e the city council has reviewed the nexus study and finds that future development within the county and city will substantially adversely affect the regional arterial system and that unless such development contributes to the cost of improving the regional arterial system the regional arterial system will operate at unacceptable levels of service f the city council finds and determines that the failure to mitigate growing traffic impacts on the regional arterial system within san diego county and the city will substantially impair the ability of public safety services police and fire to respond the failure to mitigate impacts on the regional arterial system will adversely affect the public health safety and welfare g the city council further finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the use of the rtcip fee and the type of development projects on which the fees are imposed because the fees will be used to construct the transportation improvements that are necessary for the safety health and welfare of the residential and nonresidential users of the development projects on which the rtcip fee will be levied h the city council finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the need for the improvements to the regional arterial system and the type of development projects on which the rtcip fee is imposed because it will be necessary for the residential users of such projects to have access to the regional arterial system such development will benefit from the regional arterial system improvements and the burden of such development will be mitigated in part by the payment of the rtcip fee i the city council further finds and determines that the cost estimates set forth in the nexus study are reasonable cost estimates for constructing the regional arterial system improvements and that the amount of the rtcip fee expected to be generated by new development will not exceed the total fair share cost to such development j the city council further finds that the cost estimates set forth in the nexus study are reasonable cost estimates for the facilities that comprise the regional arterial system and that rtcip fee program revenues to be generated by new development will not exceed the total fair share of these costs k the fees collected pursuant to this be used to help pay for the construction and acquisition of the regional arterial system improvements identified in the nexus study the need for the improvements is related to new development because such development results in additional traffic thus creating the demand for the improvements l the city council finds that the nexus study proposes a fair and equitable method for distributing a portion of the unfunded costs of improvements to the regional arterial system m the
