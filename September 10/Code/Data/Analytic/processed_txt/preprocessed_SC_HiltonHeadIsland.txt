citizenry therefore the town of hilton head island south carolina does ordain as follows   1att 1 21919 findings of fact the special flood hazard areas of the town of hilton head island are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruptions of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and welfare these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions of floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by structures vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damages   1att 1 21919 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas by provisions designed to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b require that buildings vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such buildings be protected against flood damages at the time of initial construction c prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands d control filling grading and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage or erosion e control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers

aviation administrations faa advisory circular 15051904a model zoning limit height of objects around airports 121487 3 delineation of the district a mapping the ao district boundaries correspond with the ldn 60 noise curve in accordance with planning standards of the faa the following five subdistricts of regulation are delineated within the ao district the ao district and subdistricts are mapped as part of the official zoning map  i discretionary noise level this level of regulation corresponds to the ldn 60 noise curve it is considered discretionary because it is the transitional impact level between significant and insignificant noise levels in the vicinity of the airport the areas to be regulated are subsections of the discretionary noise level ii significant noise level the ldn 65 noise curve is concentrically placed inside the ldn 60 noise curve due to its proximity to the airports primary surface greater noise and safety concerns exist and more restrictive regulation is required iii approach path subdistrict this approach path subdistrict is established to ensure that development near the airstrip will not pose safety problems due to vertical protrusions it is the area that extends 525 feet on both sides of the airports primary surface and extends to the ldn 60 noise curve at each end of the airports primary surface the airport runway primary surface area consists of a rectangle that is 5000 feet long and 500 feet wide the area encompassed by these special height limitations at the ends of the runway is in the shape of a trapezoid in which the smaller and larger bases are established by the faa the height of the trapezoid would be the linear distance from the end of the runway iv inner hazard zone this inner hazard zone is defined to include the runway protection zone object free area and obstacle free zone as determined by the faa all of the land within the inner hazard zone lies on the hilton head island airport property v outer hazard zone land within the outer hazard zone is identified as the area that demonstrates a higher statistical probability of aircraft accidents occurring as determined by methods developed by the institute of

delineation of the district a mapping the ao district boundaries correspond with the ldn 60 noise curve in accordance with planning standards of the faa the following five subdistricts of regulation are delineated within the ao district the ao district and subdistricts are mapped as part of the official zoning map  i discretionary noise level this level of regulation corresponds to the ldn 60 noise curve it is considered discretionary because it is the transitional impact level between significant and insignificant noise levels in the vicinity of the airport the areas to be regulated are subsections of the discretionary noise level ii significant noise level the ldn 65 noise curve is concentrically placed inside the ldn 60 noise curve due to its proximity to the airports primary surface greater noise and safety concerns exist and more restrictive regulation is required iii approach path subdistrict this approach path subdistrict is established to ensure that development near the airstrip will not pose safety problems due to vertical protrusions it is the area that extends 525 feet on both sides of the airports primary surface and extends to the ldn 60 noise curve at each end of the airports primary surface the airport runway primary surface area consists of a rectangle that is 5000 feet long and 500 feet wide the area encompassed by these special height limitations at the ends of the runway is in the shape of a trapezoid in which the smaller and larger bases are established by the faa the height of the trapezoid would be the linear distance from the end of the runway iv inner hazard zone this inner hazard zone is defined to include the runway protection zone object free area and obstacle free zone as determined by the faa all of the land within the inner hazard zone lies on the hilton head island airport property v outer hazard zone land within the outer hazard zone is identified as the area that demonstrates a higher statistical probability of aircraft accidents occurring as determined by methods developed by the institute of transportation studies at the university of california at berkeley b plat notice i a notice shall be placed on all plats for properties located within the ao district that states as follows this property lies either partially or wholly within the hilton head island airport overlay district and is subject to noise that may be objectionable ii a notice shall be placed on all plats for properties located within the outer hazard zone of the ao district that states as follows this property lies either partially or wholly within the outer hazard zone of the hilton head island airport overlay district 4 airport overlay district regulations geographically the subdistricts of the ao district overlap  however

shall rule d where a specific site in a pd2 overlay district has been developed for a use that can reasonably be considered to be longterm in nature eg residential structures and the resulting density of the use is less than the maximum density allowed for the specific site by the approved master plan the master plan shall be deemed to be automatically amended for both the site and when applicable the master plan cap to reflect the lesser density actually developed on the specific site  this provision shall not apply if a plan survey or other similar relevant document approved by the town indicates that additional development is still contemplated for the specific site after completion of development of the longterm use  this provision shall not necessarily preclude the transfer of specified density from one undeveloped site to another undeveloped site approval of minor deviations from the approved master plan in accordance with d8 minor deviations from approved master plan 5

as part of the official zoning map  i discretionary noise level this level of regulation corresponds to the ldn 60 noise curve it is considered discretionary because it is the transitional impact level between significant and insignificant noise levels in the vicinity of the airport the areas to be regulated are subsections of the discretionary noise level ii significant noise level the ldn 65 noise curve is concentrically placed inside the ldn 60 noise curve due to its proximity to the airports primary surface greater noise and safety concerns exist and more restrictive regulation is required iii approach path subdistrict this approach path subdistrict is established to ensure that development near the airstrip will not pose safety problems due to vertical protrusions it is the area that extends 525 feet on both sides of the airports primary surface and extends to the ldn 60 noise curve at each end of the airports primary surface the airport runway primary surface area consists of a rectangle that is 5000 feet long and 500 feet wide the area encompassed by these special height limitations at the ends of the runway is in the shape of a trapezoid in which the smaller and larger bases are established by the faa the height of the trapezoid would be the linear distance from the end of the runway iv inner hazard zone this inner hazard zone is defined to include the runway protection zone object free area and obstacle free zone as determined by the faa all of the land within the inner hazard zone lies on the hilton head island airport property v outer hazard zone land within the outer hazard zone is identified as the area that demonstrates a higher statistical probability of aircraft accidents occurring as determined by methods developed by the institute of

reflect the lesser density actually developed on the specific site  this provision shall not apply if a plan survey or other similar relevant document approved by the town indicates that additional development is still contemplated for the specific site after completion of development of the longterm use  this provision shall not necessarily preclude the transfer of specified density from one undeveloped site to another undeveloped site approval of minor deviations from the approved master plan in accordance with d8 minor deviations from approved master plan 5 pd2 listed master plans the

delineation of the district a mapping the ao district boundaries correspond with the ldn 60 noise curve in accordance with planning standards of the faa the following five subdistricts of regulation are delineated within the ao district the ao district and subdistricts are mapped as part of the official zoning map  i discretionary noise level this level of regulation corresponds to the ldn 60 noise curve it is considered discretionary because it is the transitional impact level between significant and insignificant noise levels in the vicinity of the airport the areas to be regulated are subsections of the discretionary noise level ii significant noise level the ldn 65 noise curve is concentrically placed inside the ldn 60 noise curve due to its proximity to the airports primary surface greater noise and safety concerns exist and more restrictive regulation is required iii approach path subdistrict this approach path subdistrict is established to ensure that development near the airstrip will not pose safety problems due to vertical protrusions it is the area that extends 525 feet on both sides of the airports primary surface and extends to the ldn 60 noise curve at each end of the airports primary surface the airport runway primary surface area consists of a rectangle that is 5000 feet long and 500 feet wide the area encompassed by these special height limitations at the ends of the runway is in the shape of a trapezoid in which the smaller and larger bases are established by the faa the height of the trapezoid would be the linear distance from the end of the runway iv inner hazard zone this inner hazard zone is defined to include the runway protection zone object free area and obstacle free zone as determined by the faa all of the land within the inner hazard zone lies on the hilton head island airport property v outer hazard zone land within the outer hazard zone is identified as the area that demonstrates a higher statistical probability of aircraft accidents occurring as determined by methods developed by the institute of transportation studies at the university of california at berkeley b plat notice i a notice shall be placed on all

of the use is less than the maximum density allowed for the specific site by the approved master plan the master plan shall be deemed to be automatically amended for both the site and when applicable the master plan cap to reflect the lesser density actually developed on the specific site  this provision shall not apply if a plan survey or other similar relevant document approved by the town indicates that additional development is still contemplated for the specific site after completion of development of the longterm use  this provision shall not necessarily preclude the transfer of specified density from one undeveloped site to another undeveloped site approval of minor deviations from the approved master plan in accordance with d8 minor deviations from approved master plan 5

are delineated within the ao district the ao district and subdistricts are mapped as part of the official zoning map  i discretionary noise level this level of regulation corresponds to the ldn 60 noise curve it is considered discretionary because it is the transitional impact level between significant and insignificant noise levels in the vicinity of the airport the areas to be regulated are subsections of the discretionary noise level ii significant noise level the ldn 65 noise curve is concentrically placed inside the ldn 60 noise curve due to its proximity to the airports primary surface greater noise and safety concerns exist and more restrictive regulation is required iii approach path subdistrict this approach path subdistrict is established to ensure that development near the airstrip will not pose safety problems due to vertical protrusions it is the area that extends 525 feet on both sides of the airports primary surface and extends to the ldn 60 noise curve at each end of the airports primary surface the airport runway primary surface area consists of a rectangle that is 5000 feet long and 500 feet wide the area encompassed by these special height limitations at the ends of the runway is in the shape of a trapezoid in which the smaller and larger bases are established by the faa the height of the trapezoid would be the linear distance from the end of the runway iv inner hazard zone this inner hazard zone is defined to include the runway protection zone object free area and obstacle free zone as determined by the faa all of the land within the inner hazard zone lies on the hilton head island airport property v outer hazard zone land within the outer hazard zone is identified as the area that demonstrates a higher statistical probability of

intended to encourage creativity in design and planning in the development of parcels between five and 249 acres by allowing greater design flexibility than the underlying base zoning district so that natural features may be protected and development concentrated in more suitable or less environmentally sensitive areas 2 designation of district a pd2 overlay district may be established in any base district other than the con district using the provisions set forth in d planned unit development pud district 3 permitted uses any use permitted by right  subject to use specific conditions or as a special exception in the underlying base district is permitted where multiple base zoning districts are incorporated in the pd2 the uses shall remain proportional to the area of the underlying base zoning districts  4 density and development standards a a section or phase of the planned development may be built at a density which is greater than the sitespecific density allowed by the underlying base zoning district  provided that any such concentration of density is offset by an area of lower density in another section or phase of the planned development or by an appropriate reservation of common open space elsewhere in the planned development the average density for the pd2 overlay district shall not exceed the maximum density permitted in the base zoning district  b the standards for impervious cover and open space within a pd2 overlay district shall be fully satisfied for the district as a whole but do not have to be satisfied on a site specific basis within individual phases of the planned development c when a pd2 overlay district overlays more than one base zoning district  the area standards shall be prorated based on the district acreage and the average resulting standard shall rule d where a specific site in a pd2 overlay district has been developed for a use that can reasonably be considered to be longterm in nature eg residential structures and the resulting density of the use is less than the maximum density allowed for the specific site by the approved master plan the master plan shall be deemed to be automatically amended for both the site and when applicable the master plan cap to reflect the lesser density actually developed on the specific site  this provision shall not apply if a plan survey or other similar relevant document approved by the town indicates that additional development is still contemplated for the specific site after completion of development of the longterm use  this provision shall not necessarily preclude the transfer of specified density from one undeveloped site to another undeveloped site approval of minor deviations from the approved master plan in accordance with d8 minor deviations from approved master plan 5

analysis standards a purpose the purpose of this section is to guide development in accordance with the existing and future needs of the town in order to protect promote and improve the public health safety morals convenience order appearance prosperity and general welfare of the citizens of the town  by ensuring new development does not overburden and congest the towns streets  b intent the regulations of this section are designed and intended 1 to ensure that the towns adopted traffic service level standards are met within the town and to provide safety from fire panic and other dangers to promote the public health and general welfare to prevent the overcrowding of land  to avoid undue concentration of population and to facilitate the adequate provision of street facilities 2 to enable the town to conduct an appropriate review and evaluation of the traffic impact of proposed development  to provide for the imposition of conditions in order to assure that new development does not impair the towns ability and obligation to provide adequate street facilities to all its citizens and to prescribe necessary projectspecific mitigation measures or to otherwise condition traffic impact analysis plan approval 3 to ensure that no traffic impact analysis plan approvals are granted that would cause a reduction in the service level of any street facility that is currently operating in a manner that fails to satisfy the towns adopted traffic service level standards  4 to ensure that no traffic impact analysis plan approvals are granted unless street facilities with adequate capacity to accommodate the traffic generated by the proposed development are available concurrently with the scheduled opening of the development  5 to establish uniform procedures for the review of applications for traffic impact analysis plan approval subject to the traffic impact analysis plan requirements set forth herein 6 to better coordinate the shortterm growth potential of the town with the immediately available street system capacity taking into account exempt development and approved development that has not been built to the extent to which these may be eligible for development plan approval without being subject to the traffic impact analysis plan requirements of this section 7 to better coordinate the longterm growth potential of the town with a realistic assessment of street capacity which is currently and which may in the future become available recognizing the limitations on the towns financial resources the constraints presented by the geography of the island and the need to preserve the islands sensitive natural historic and environmental resources 8 to better coordinate the type location amount timing and rate of development of proposed land uses in accordance with the comprehensive plan  zoning district regulations and official zoning map with the present and projected future availability of street system capacity 9 to establish and maintain a traffic monitoring system to regularly determine the volume of traffic on the town  s street system and the degree to which capacity limits thresholds are being approached or exceeded 10 it is not the intent of this section to deny to any person a reasonable opportunity to develop land in a beneficial manner but rather to coordinate the type location amount timing and rate of development
