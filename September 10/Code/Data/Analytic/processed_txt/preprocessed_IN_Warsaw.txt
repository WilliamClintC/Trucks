at 35 psi for two minutes the air supply shall be shut off or disconnected and the stopwatch started for the test h observe the pressure gauge and record the time required for the pressure to drop

prohibited discharge standards a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 78243a of this division or the specific prohibitions in subsection 78243b of this division if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to believe or know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the utility was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements c bypass 1 for the purpose of this section a bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a users treatment facility b severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which

oral report has been received within 24 hours d bypass 1 bypass is prohibited and the utility may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required under subsection c of this section 2 the utility may approve an

7  editors note  adopted  amended to read in its entirety as herein set out former  pertained to environmental development regulations and derived from see table for complete derivation 181  statutory authorization findings of fact purpose and objectives a statutory authorization  the indiana legislature has in ic 3674 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions therefore the common council of the city of warsaw does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations b findings of fact  1 the flood hazard areas of the city of warsaw are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated inadequately floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c statement of purpose  it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction 3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters 4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 6 make federal flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program d objectives the objectives of this ordinance are 1 to protect human life and health 2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects 3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public 4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions 5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains 6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood bright areas  982015 182  definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable application a zone means portions of the sfha in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall snowmelt or a combination of both in a zones floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly but waves are usually not a significant threat to buildings these areas are labeled as zone a zone ae zones a1a30 zone ao zone ah zone ar and zone a99 on a firm the definitions are presented below zone a areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed no base flood elevation or depths are shown zone ae and a1a30 areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods base flood elevations are shown within these zones zone ae is on new and revised maps in place of zones a1a30 zone ao areas subject to inundation by one percent annual chance shallow flooding usually sheet flow on sloping terrain where average depths are between one and three feet average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone zone ah areas subject to inundation by one percent annual chance shallow flooding usually areas of ponding where average depths are between one and three feet average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone zone ar areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection zone a99 areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an underconstruction federal flood protection system these are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection system such as dikes dams and levees to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes zone a99 may only be used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion no base flood elevations or depths are shown accessory structure appurtenant structure means a structure with a floor area 400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the
