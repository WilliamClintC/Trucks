topersons interested in tyler city gary landers city attorney subjectreorganization of city  explanation on  the tyler city council approved which completely reorganized the changing it from 31 chapters and three 3 appendices into 20 chapters the old organized under a traditional approach which grouped regulations under related topic headings in chapters that were in alphabetical order based upon the name of the topic the reorganized to wherever possible take all regulations that are administered by the same department and place them in chapters which are more closely related to the structural organization of the city the chapters of the new then put in an order roughly equalling administrative services departments police planning and neighborhood services and public services the result of the new organization of the that the first three new chapters named administration finance & taxation and personnel are those three chapters which apply to all city employees offenses and miscellaneous provisions is still a catchall chapter that consists mainly of ordinance regulations that are administered by the police department but may include other provisions which would not easily fit into another chapter the remaining chapters some of which have new names are mostly regrouped and reorganized so that only that department or those departments that are involved in using those ordinance regulations would need to be familiar with that chapter since there is some crossover responsibility within the city where the same ordinance may be administered by more than one department it was impossible to separate all ordinances into individual department chapters however the majority of the new organized in department specific chapters although this change like any change will initially make it more difficult for individuals using the code to find a particular section eventually it should result in a situation where it is much easier for city user departments to find and be familiar with their provisions of the for citizens or other persons unfamiliar with the find the specific sections they are interested in remember to check all forms and letters because the references to them wil probably need to be changed how to get new code the new reorganized to become effective  that just means that the old unusual sized black bound code books will no longer be the city that date the new reorganized code will be available in regular lettersized threering binders three assistant city managers and two chiefs along with this reorganizing of the the city council has also cancelled the contract the city has had for many years with an outside codifier company and it will now become the responsibility of legal to provide inhouse supplements for the city thus legal along with the city clerk and print shop will become responsible for providing the original copies of the new supplements as changes are made the plan is for legal to make changes to the by the city council within a week after the council approves the changes and then bring copies of those changes supplements to each location that has city codes and will change or supplement the codes thus under this new plan it will no longer be the responsibility of each individual department to receive a stack of supplements and update their own code book instead legal will provide this service to all user departments providing current codes more timely number of codes and partial or entire codes an option now available to departments is that each department may choose to have either a copy of the entire code in their threering binder or only those specific chapters of the that department is involved in regulating since administration finance & taxation and personnel apply to all departments it is expected that all departments will want a copy of those three chapters in addition to the chapter or chapters that department administers for example the police department might choose to have a partial code that just includes chapters 1 3  plus chapters 4 and 17 the parks department might choose to have a partial code that includes chapters 13 and parks after receiving this memo each department head or each work site supervisor that has in the past had a copy of the city which would like to have a copy of the the future should contact their assistant city manager or chief to discuss how many copies of the code are needed in that department and whether those copies should be of the entire excerpts from the the assistant city managers and chiefs will then pass this information on to legal which can then make the needed copies it is expected that these copies will be distributed to department heads during one of their division meetings where a representative of legal will come and answer questions and distribute copies of the new reorganized onepage chart showing the chapters of the old the chapters of the new explaining where chapters of the old found in the new attached for your information computer disk another option that is now available is for a department to choose to have the a 3 12 x 5 computer disk rather than in a hard copy a partial code would be available on one disk and the entire city available on two disks in order to effectively use the disk the user department would also need to buy a site license allowing them to use software called folio which provides for almost instant access to keywords or regulatory terms in the means of electronic search the site license cost is $2500 recodification all of the above are steps in an overall project the city council approved last fall to completely revise and recodify city ordinances bound in the a more specific memo detailing the recodification process and proposed timetables will be distributed in a short time conclusion the effective date of the new arrive very soon and thus it is vital that each city work site that has a copy of the wants a copy of the together with their assistant city manager or chief right away and decide how many copies and whether they will be partial or entire copies the sooner this information is returned to the city attorneys office the sooner the new codes can be distributed  respectfully submitted glclgary landers city attorney  attachment   tyler code  table of contents as of 21595     from current pre 21595toproposed 21595  to be

prevention and protection regulations have now been moved to it is an example of a chapter that is administered by more than one department including fire building inspection and neighborhood services new parks is simply the result of taking old transferring all of its provisions to a new chapter new library is the result of taking the regulations relating to the library board from old placing them in a new separate department specific chapter new planning and zoning is the result of combining several related regulations taking the landscape old all of old planning and zoning and combining them with old appendix a zoning and appending b subdivisions new is the result of simply taking all airportrelated regulations from old moving them to a new new animals simply takes all provisions from all moves them to this new chapter new franchises is the other chapter in the reorganized code which was not moved around so that it has remained unchanged in the way it codifies the cable electric gas and telephone franchises but it also has combined with it now the remainder of old appendix c new chapters 16 17 and 19 are primarily associated with the public services division departments new was previously reviewed by the city council and created as a separate department specific chapter prior to this reorganization ordinance streets sidewalks and traffic combines provisions from many old chapters including chapters 26 29 and 31 this chapter is also an example of a set of regulations which are administered by several departments and thus it includes regulations that are the responsibility of the police traffic street and engineering departments new utilities combines old chapters 21 lake regulations with old water utilities regulations checklist of uptodate pages this

who execute a tax abatement agreement with the city the purpose of the tax abatement is to encourage the growth and establishment of industry and commercial enterprise in the city growth is measured both by increases in capital expenditure for buildings machinery and other capital goods and the increase in the tyler workforce the citys priority for tax abatement is to extend tax abatement to primary employers a primary employer is one which forms the economic base of the community by generating a majority of sales outside of smith county in providing local jobs the retention of existing jobs is recognized as more important than recruitment of new companies surveys in texas have shown three fourths of new jobs come from expansion of existing local companies abatement is given to provide significant long term positive economic impact to the community by using local contractors and the resident workforce to the maximum extent feasible and by developing redeveloping and improving real estate within the city limits the citys goal in providing tax abatements is to create additional jobs within the city abatements however may be granted when the city is convinced that the abatement is needed to retain existing jobs which would otherwise be lost examples of uses eligible for abatements include manufacturing distribution centers corporate or regional office parks and research facilities small companies have provided a significant source of new jobs within the city therefore proposals by small entrepreneurs will be encouraged whenever the proposals comply with the

the investment and management of all city funds under its control other than those expressly excluded within this document or by applicable law or valid agreement the fire pension fund is excluded from this policy because it is separately organized and managed by contract with investment companies as directed by the fire pension board and the lindsey police and firefighters endowment fund is

          investment strategy the city shall use a pooled cash and investment approach commingling money from various fund types for market efficiency to the extent that is practical and legal the following investment strategy considerations recognize the unique advantages of a pooled cash and investment portfolio including the reduction of cash flow uncertainty and the increased opportunity of yield curve extension funds included in the portfolio will include those from the operating funds debt service and debt reserve funds and special projects the liquidity requirements of the pooled investment portfolio will be projected and matched with maturities pooled fund group suitability  any investment eligible in the investment policy is suitable for pooled fund groups safety of principal  all investments shall be of high quality with no perceived default risk market price fluctuations will occur however managing the weighted average days to maturity to less than 270 days and restricting the maximum allowable maturity to two years using the final stated maturity dates of each investment will minimize the price volatility of the portfolio marketability  securities with active and efficient secondary markets are necessary in the event of an unanticipated cash flow requirement historical market spreads between the bid and offer prices of a particular securitytype of less than a quarter of a percentage point will define an efficient secondary market liquidity  pooled fund groups require shortterm liquidity to adequately fund any unanticipated cash outflow shortterm financial institution deposits investment pools and money market mutual funds will provide daily liquidity and may be utilized as a competitive yield alternative to fixed maturity investments diversification  investment maturities should be staggered throughout the budget cycle to provide cash flow based on the anticipated operating needs of the city diversifying the appropriate maturity structure up to the twoyear maximum will reduce interest rate risk yield  attaining a competitive market yield for comparable securitytypes and portfolio restrictions is the desired objective the yield of an equally weighted rolling threemonth treasury bill portfolio will be the minimum yield objective special project and bond proceeds funds at times special project and bond proceed funds may be better suited invested outside the pooled fund group in those cases the following strategy shall be applicable suitability  any investment eligible in the investment policy is suitable for special project and bond proceeds funds safety of principal  all investments will be of high quality with no perceived default risk market price fluctuations will occur however by managing special project and bond proceeds to not exceed the anticipated expenditure schedule the market risk of the overall portfolio will be minimized maximum maturity five years from date of purchase marketability  securities with active and efficient secondary markets are necessary in the event of an unanticipated cash flow requirement historical market spreads between the bid and offer prices of a particular securitytype of less than a quarter of a percentage point will define an efficient secondary market liquidity  special project and bond proceeds funds used for capital improvements programs have reasonably predictable draw down schedules therefore investment maturities should generally follow the anticipated cash flow requirements short term financial institution deposits investment pools and money market mutual funds will provide readily available funds generally equal to one months anticipated cash flow needs or a competitive yield alternative for short term fixed maturity investments a singular repurchase agreement or similarly structured investment vehicle may be utilized if disbursements are allowed in the amount necessary to satisfy any expenditure request this investment structure is commonly referred to as a flexible repurchase agreement diversification  market conditions and arbitrage regulations influence the attractiveness of staggering the maturity of fixed rate investments for special project and bond proceeds funds generally when investment rates exceed the applicable cost of borrowing the city is best served by locking in most investments if the cost of borrowing cannot be exceeded then concurrent market conditions will determine the attractiveness of diversifying maturities or investing in shorter and larger amounts at no time shall the anticipated expenditure schedule be exceeded in an attempt to bolster yield yield  achieving a positive spread to the cost of borrowing is the desired objective within the limits of the investment policys risk constraints the yield of an equally weighted rolling sixmonth treasury bill portfolio will be the minimum yield objective for nonborrowed funds 22 00 2401 132002 02003 65  1004

transportation network by the requested infrastructure improvements to the number of vehicle trips created by the proposed development if the traffic demand created by the proposed development is roughly equal to or greater than the increase in traffic capacity supplied by the requested improvements then the improvements are proportional  csupply calculation to calculate the supply being added to the transportation network by the requested improvements the length of the street adjacent to the subdivision in miles is multiplied by the number of additional lanes being added to the system and multiplied by the traffic capacity which the lane can carry the length of street adjacent to a subdivision shall be determined by a survey provided by the owner the number of lanes required for a street shall be based on the adopted master street plan when the master street plan calls for wider lanes than the minimum requirement according to the number of additional lanes used for the supply calculation shall be the difference between the minimum and master street plan widths divided by the width of a single lane  images000130808png if additional street width is constructed to allow for on street parking the developer may get credit for an additional lane of traffic provided that the additional street width is at least nine feet wider than the minimum required street width the

and alternative standards 1the development incentives and alternative standards listed below may be used provided the development complies with associated nonstructural storm water controls such as stormwater conservation areas andor structural storm water controls such as permeable pavement grassy swalesbuffer strips storm water ponds and bio retention areas the intent of a storm water conservation area is to reduce impervious surfaces  to allow natural infiltration of storm water runoff  to preserve floodplain wetlands and other undisturbed natural areas  and to provide space for other nonstructural or structural storm water controls the intent of permeable pavement grassy swalesbuffer strips storm water ponds bio retention areas and other structural controls is to provide infiltration filtration and pollutant removal of storm water runoff 2developments that propose to use the development incentives and alternative standards must follow the site development plan review

establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation it is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will help minimize threats to public health and safety bpurpose the purpose of this ordinance is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction this ordinance seeks to meet that purpose following objectives 1minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding siltation increases in stream temperature and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels  2 minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality 3 minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the predevelopment hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable 4 reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution wherever possible management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety capplicability this ordinance shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan applications unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the city of tyler under the specifications of of this ordinance the ordinance also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules to prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff the city of tyler has developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new development sites these standards apply to construction activity disturbing 5000 or more square feet of land the following activities may be exempt from these stormwater performance criteria 1any logging and agricultural activity which is consistent with an approved soil conservation plan or a timber management plan prepared or approved by the development services department or designated agent as applicable 2additions or modifications to existing single family structures 3developments that do not disturb more than 5000 square feet of land provided they are not part of a larger common development plan  4repairs to any stormwater treatment practice deemed necessary by the city of tyler 5any permit issued or

post construction stormwater runoff pcsr requirements of this code but is subsequently annexed to the city will have nonconforming use status with respect to this code 2 regulation of nonconforming developments a the lawful use of a building or other development as described in subsection 1 above may be continued although such development does not comply with the pcsr requirements herein however voluntary compliance with these pcsr requirements and enhancement is encouraged b the repair or restoration of a building or other development to its prior condition after being damaged or destroyed by fire explosion wind flood tornado or other accident or weather phenomena will not require that such building or other development comply with the pcsr requirements of this code provided a building

control insurance act texas water delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council of city of tyler texas does ordain as follows findings of fact athe flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are created by cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage 1898    statement of purpose it is the purpose of this division to promote the public health safety and welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to aprotect human life and health  bminimize expenditure of public money for costly floodcontrol projects  cminimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the public  dminimize prolonged business interruptions  eminimize negative impact to public streets storm sewer systems and drainage ways  fminimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  ghelp maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas so as to minimize future flood blight areas  and hinsure that information is available to potential buyers concerning property in a designated flood area 1898   methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this division uses the following methods a restricts or prohibits uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  brequires that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  ccontrols the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  dcontrols filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  eprevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 1898    definitions for purposes of this

in 1992 reserved division a boundary extension and annexation boundary extension and annexation athe city council may extend the city limits and annex additional territory lying adjacent to the city by passing an ordinance setting forth the metes and bounds of the area sought to be annexed declaring the territory within the defined boundaries to be a part of the city and ordering it subject to all of the rules and regulations applicable to the city in accordance with state law ban applicants seeking annexation pursuant to texas local government or successor must file a petition with the planning department containing the following information and conforming to the following requirements 1a metes and bounds description of the tract to be annexed 2a list of all qualified voters who reside on the tract 3the petition must be signed by each owner 4each owners signature must be acknowledged in the manner required for deeds 5the application must be accompanied with a plat of the tract to be annexed drawn to scale which must aidentify the ownership of each parcel of land  bshow any public ways within or bounding the tract  cshow any easement within or bordering the tract  dshow the existing city limits boundaries 6information required for original zoning 7the application must be accompanied with a filing fee in an amount established by the city council and kept on file in the planning department 2297 annexation goals and policies texas cities derive their annexation authority from state law as a home rule city tyler has the right to annex voluntarily or involuntarily any area within its extraterritorial jurisdiction etj or any cityowned property subject to state law requirements the etj includes the unincorporated area within five miles of the city limits excluding any area that is legally existing in the etj of another city within its etj the city also has the right to approve the creation of other political jurisdictions and enforce its subdivisions annexation is one of the most important tools available to cities in texas to determine their future in recognition of that fact and based upon the authority outlined above the city adopts the following annexation goals and policies because the parameters bearing on specific annexations and boundary adjustments vary so considerably these goals and policies are intended as flexible guidelines to be followed rather than as absolute mandates also the intent of all the policies together should be considered rather than one policy individually 2305 agoal i preserve the citys range of annexation options the authority granted to texas home rule cities to fix and extend their boundaries and to exchange areas with other municipalities is very broad the city should exercise that authority when appropriate and vigorously oppose any effort to reduce it 1policies athe city may at its discretion annex any lands within its exclusive etj in accordance with state laws and the city charter bthe city should consider annexation for the purpose of enforcing health and safety regulations and improving the quality of life cthe city should vigorously pursue violations of its etj to the fullest extent allowable by law bgoal ii promote orderly growth and provision of municipal services within unincorporated areas in texas there are very limited development controls annexation of areas facing development pressures can ensure proper land use relationships and high standards of construction tyler unified development building codes thereby assuring adequate health and safety standards and averting costly future problems for the city when a major city remains viable it can usually provide more services and a higher level of service than can a smaller community this is particularly true in the tyler metropolitan area where the city is so much larger than the other incorporated cities because of its size the city expends considerable resources planning for development and major thoroughfares within its etj annexation allows the city to enjoy the benefits of that investment in planning 1policies athe city should consider annexing areas facing the prospect of development as a means of effectively controlling the quality of growth extension of the citys zoning and other regulations bthe city should annex cityowned property when appropriate as soon as possible after acquisition cprospective annexation areas should be evaluated to determine their impact on existing services and city budget cgoal iii enhance the citys fiscal position as the major city and cultural center of the region the city provides and supports many services which are available to residents of unincorporated areas as well as to those within the city limits annexation provides a means for the city to recoup partially the costs of these services annexation also provides a means for the city to avoid a dwindling tax base unlike many states texas cities have considerable authority to annex adjacent unincorporated areas there is a very good reason for this in parts of the nation where cities are unable to annex there is a tendency for those who can afford to do so to escape city taxes and problems in favor of the suburbs the result is that such cities are abandoned to their poorer citizens with their needs growing while their resources diminish while inner city housing ages and depreciates in value new housing occurs primarily on the city fringe primarily outside the city limits commercial and industrial centers then follow the population trend away from the center city without annexation the city could be faced with decreasing rather than increasing resources by retaining control over its planning area the city can plan for the most efficient design and use of its infrastructure particularly its utilities and major thoroughfares annexation can also prevent or inhibit the further fragmentation of government thereby reducing the total cost of government for citizens in the region decreasing the difficulties of resolving multi jurisdictional problems 1policies athe city should consider annexation to protect the citys fiscal viability by extending its tax base for ad valorem taxes including both real and personal property and sales taxes and to maintain the citys bond rating bthe city should consider annexing nonresidential areas as a means of maximizing the citys investment return careas which are in need of municipal services but would create a fiscal liability to the city should be annexed in conjunction with other areas which would generate offsetting revenue surpluses dcostrevenue analyses for prospective annexation areas should be estimated for at least 10 years after annexation identified capital costs should include estimated debt service as determined by the finance department eannexation costs should be considered budgetary mandates fareas to be annexed are eligible to receive city water and sewer services as provided in the tyler gthe city should consider annexation to extend its etj to provide development controls to areas it deems are in need of such controls hthe city should oppose the creation of additional cities special purpose districts and water or wastewater utilities within its etj unless the city determines it is not responsible and cost effective to provide the necessary services ithe city may annex areas to preclude the creation of other political jurisdictions jthe city should consider the following criteria prior to releasing any portion of its corporate limits or etj to another city 1there should be an exchange of areas of equivalent value with the other jurisdiction  2the other city should have adequate land use controls as determined by the city to protect the subject area and provide assurances that these controls will remain in effect  3the existing city limit or etj is not a logical planning boundary  4potentially significant negative fiscal impacts on the citys budget will not result if the area is released  and 5the area does not contain environmental resources in need of city protection dgoal v maintain a systematic annexation process the process by which unincorporated areas are selected for annexation should be clearly understood and designed to predict when a particular area will be annexed with some degree of certainty such a process would assist in providing timely extensions of public infrastructure systems and in estimating city revenues property owners would also benefit by knowing when their properties will receive municipal services and when taxes will be assessed 1policies aannexation and disannexation petitions should be considered on an individual basis and referred to the city attorney for a determination of sufficiency as to form and legality bin accordance with state law the city will prepare an annexation plan identifying prospective annexation areas for the next three years the plan will be amended as needed 2297  1599 city limits in 1999 the texas local government that an irrebuttable presumption attaches to the inclusion within the city of any area that has been functionally a part of the city for 20 years city records indicate that the area designated in the exhibit a which is attached to the ordinance adopting this section has been a part of the city for at least the preceding 20 years and the city has provided municipal services including police protection to the area and has treated the area as part of the city during the preceding 20 years city records also indicate that there has not been a final judicial determination during the preceding 20 years that the area is outside of the boundaries of the city and that there is no pending lawsuit that challenges the inclusion of the area as part of the city therefore the city council finds that the requirements of state law for inclusion of the area have been met and the inclusion of the area designated in exhibit a is not contestable     911 0201124  1111 25 11 2411 2411  2212 2812 2312  2713 2214 2815 27 16 2517      123 19      899reserved article xiii definitions  division a

water and water sources currently the city of tyler has three 3 major water sources available for high water demand and emergency drought events the city operates two 2 surface water treatment plants the primary source is lake tyler and lake tyler east which is treated and distributed by the golden road water treatment plant lake tylerlake tyler east have a combined permitted water right for 40325 acre feet per year the golden road plant is rated at twentyeight 28 mgd the citys secondary source is lake palestine and the city has 67200 acre feet per year available from this source raw water is piped from lake palestine to the lake palestine water treatment plant for treatment and distribution the lake palestine water treatment plant is rated at thirty 30 mgd the third source is 12 active deep ground water wells however only 10 of the wells are used regularly two of the wells are only operated in emergency conditions the wells pull from the carrizowilcox aquifer the wells are used regularly and for backup the wells have the combined capacity of approximately eight 8 mgd also the city has lake bellwood in the past used to supply raw water to industries with 2200 acre feet per year available this is minor in comparison to the other 3 major sources of water the city has available to it in case of a failure of one of the water treatment plants the other plant will take over water production for distribution the wells will be circulated and the elevated storage monitored to help with peak and emergency demands during a drought or other possible water shortage event 2311

in 1986 this act requires that a water conservation plan and emergency demand management plan be adopted by political subdivisions house bill 2 was approved by texas voters  becoming an amendment to the texas constitution in 2002 the state of texas adopted the state water plan which recognizes the need for water conservation in order to meet future needs of texas in 200 the 78th texas legislature established the water conservation implementation task force via passage of senate bill sb 1094 in sb 1094 the task force was directed to review evaluate and recommend several water based conservation programs including the development of a best management practices guide for use by regional water planning groups and political subdivisions responsible for water delivery service these actions enabled the texas commission on environmental quality tceq and the texas water development board twdb to develop best management practices bmps guidelines task 1 of sb 109 for water providers of the state to consider while updating water conservation and emergency demand management plans the twdb and the tceq were to make efforts to implement hb 2660 which directed the two agencies to identify quantified target goals for water conservation for water suppliers and other entities in 2007 house bill 4 amended the texas water requiring the texas commission on environmental quality tceq to require retail public utilities that provide potable water to 3300 or more connections to submit a water conservation plan to the texas water development board the plan must include specific targets and goals developed by the utility using best management practices or other strategies to reduce water waste loss and consumption these reduction goals are to be based on municipal use in gallons per capita per day butilization of all state resources is dictated if affordable development is to occur on a statewide basis water a basic human need will be a major factor in development conservation of water is necessary if we are to meet future needs for our most valuable resource cpassage of house bill 2 and house joint resolution 6 senate bill sb 109 house bill 266 and in 2007 house bill 4 by the texas legislature and voters of texas reflect that the need for conservation of water resources has been recognized and is a high priority for state officials as well as the environmental protection agency and other federal agencies all water conservation plans must be updated every five years and are required to send in annual information on the effectiveness of the best management practices adopted the regional water planning group tceq and the texas water development board should be sent the conservation plan updates as well as the annual reports for best management practice

goal for municipal water loss is set at 38 gpcd or a five percent reduction and the tenyear goal is to reduce water loss by 10 percent for a goal of 36 gpcd goals will be met by continued implementation of the included best management practices and from other outlined planning elements 4achieving the established goals will conserve our most valuable resource water it will also enable existing facilities to provide service for additional customers without further expenditures for expansion however if the need does arise the city of tyler does have the capability of expanding the water treatment plants such as the lake palestine water treatment plant to allow for future growth for the service area hpublic involvement 1the city of tyler city council meets on a regular basis on

entirety by the city and aired on the citys cable television channel 2311    water conservation plan and best management practices athe following planning elements have been developed in accordance with the requirements listed in tceq regulations and include guidelines by the texas water development board and the water conservation implementation task force bthe best management practices that have been adopted and implemented by the city of tyler are educational best management practice bmp plumbing codes bmp water conservation retrofit program conservation oriented water rate structure system water audit and water loss bmp industrial alternate sources and reuse bmp metering of all connections and retrofit of existing connections bmp prohibition on wasting water bmp industrial site specific conservation bmp cooling towers bmp contracts with other political subdivisions record management system annual reporting    ceducational best management practice the city of tyler will inform its customers of various recommended methods for reduction in water consumption generally a majority of water consumption in the city is consumed by residential customers therefore the target area for educational information is residential customers 1program or activities will consist of the activities listed aa fact sheet explaining the conservation plan will be developed and made available to the customers and schools ban article will be placed in the local newspaper correlated with fact sheet preparation and include information on how to acquire the homeowners guide highlights of water saving methods and elaboration on available brochures the brochures will be available at tyler water utilities office and certain brochures will be mailed directly to the customer one of the brochures will target one particular household water using appliance and include specific measures for conserving water cmake available to each new customer the homeowners guide to water use and conservation  waterhalf a hundred ways to save it how to save water outside the home or how to save water inside the home these new customer guides will be available at tyler water utilities office the city will also update any guides and available materials on an annual basis 2the revised program will consist of the following listed activities a updates to the water conservation portion of the tyler water utilities webpage explaining ways that water conservation can be achieved at home b brochures relating to outside household use and car washing lawn watering correlated to weather predictions are available to customers in the twu office and made available either by mail out pick up or via the citys web page chomeowners guide to water use and conservation  waterhalf a hundred ways to save it how to save water outside the home or how to save water inside the home brochures will continue to be distributed to new customers 3new customers will be advised of the citys conservation program and provided with a copy of homeowners guide and other listed guides and brochures if requested the city will utilize resource materials available from the texas commission on environmental quality and other agencies or organizations which develop and distribute pertinent information or data on water conservation to water customers throughout the state 4educational materials will be given to area schools for use with taught curriculum to emphasize the importance of conservation the target goal is to reach 10% of students on an annual basis on a tiered program 5educational tours of the water and wastewater treatment facilities are given to area schools groups and clubs to provide education on the operation of the facilities and the need for conservation methods at home work and school 6educational bmps are usually are not quantifiable therefore an estimate of savings will not be included for this bmp the end result of an educational program is a longterm investment in the customers and their families that when taught conservation it will be more likely that they will follow the teachings and therefore conserve water and money of water saving devices performing outside watering activities at appropriate times and with proper tools dimplementation 1educational materials have been distributed to area elementary schools starting the first year along with information regarding the availability for tours to the water and wastewater treatment facilities 2during the second year of implementation the area intermediate middle schools were targeted for educational materials and informational tours 3the third year of implementation targeted the area high schools and higher education facilities tours for this level was also available materials and other such programs are made available 4organizations clubs and groups including scouting programs 4h and boys & girls clubs were encouraged to participate in the tour programs and received educational materials 5documentation of the educational materials and type of materials made available to the schools groups clubs and other organizations was kept on file and reported annually the report included the approximate percent of students reached by the distribution of such materials and that said materials met state curriculum requirements this information is also reported on the required annual reports to tceq and twdb 6documentation of the number of presentations made on an annual basis will be kept on file and reported annually 7an annual budget for the educational materials and presentation programs related to conservation shall also be included in the annual report eplumbing codes the city of tyler currently uses the 2015 edition of the international plumbing the plumbing code this requirements for the use of water saving plumbing fixtures in new construction fwater conservation retrofit program the city of tyler encourages customers to utilize low demand fixtures and appliances educational sources described in this plan the city advises customers of low water demand items shower heads toilet dams etc by mail andor publication of newspaper articles emphasizing the importance of water saving devices the city will contact local suppliers of plumbing supplies advising them of the water saving drive content suppliers will be encouraged to stock low water usage fixtures and low water use supplies different programs for new more energy efficient appliances and household items will be offered either city or in partnership with the city to customers typically these programs are brought to the attention of the customers via the citys webpage and or by publication using various types of media gconservation oriented water rate structure city of tyler water rate structure 30 tac 2882 a1hcity of tyler 60 currently the city of tylers rate structure is a declining block rate structure the declining block rate structure is costbased and does not encourage the excessive use of water tyler uses a declining block rate structure because it reflects the manner in which costs are incurred and equitably allocates these costs among the various types of customers served tyler reviews and updates its costs and usage patterns every five years and updates its rates accordingly the city is currently reviewing this rate structure and plans to convert to an inclining block rate design to conform to tceq regulations and twdb guidelines with a proposed implementation date of  hsystem water audit and water loss 1the city of tyler will implement the system water audit and water loss bmp from the tceq and twdb best management practices guidelines starting in the first year and in phases remainder of the first five year planning period 2the city conducted a system water audit in two parts the first of which is known as a top down audit the city used existing records to determine estimated annual water loss previously the city of tyler has a water loss of approximately 10 % the city has been fortunate and continued diligently to keep other information such as customer billing summaries leak repair summaries meter change out summaries and other relevant water use summaries and was able to continue the current number of approximately 9 to 10% depending on the season the water utility billing software is currently capable of reporting the necessary topdown audit information needed annually the city gathers the top down audit information they then determine the areas of concern and the proper conservation techniques to implement to bring down the water loss percentage and report this information to the appropriate agency the city of tylers goal is to have the lowest percentage of unaccounted for water or water loss possible the city has set a target goal of an ili of 3 if the ili of 3 is still not met with implementing the bmp the city will continue with the second step of the water audit 3several phases of the bottomup portion of the water audit were implemented over the remainder of this last five year period this second step involved the detailed investigation of policies and procedures of the utility the bottomup portion of the audit also includes procedures for all water use by the fire department for line flushing street cleaning and all other authorized uses to be metered and or accounted for 4a leak detection program will be implemented to monitor the system for leaks records will be kept to track the repair of the leak including the length of time for repair pressure of the repaired line and approximate amount of water lost due to the leak 5a program to monitor system pressures will also be set up to monitor pressures throughout the system to aid in locating line leaks 6a computerized water model of the tyler water system will be prepared and added to as necessary iimplementation the city of tyler has implemented the bmp using all available resources the citys goal as stated previously is an ili of 3 in order to reach this goal the city will have to continue to be proactive in the actions and steps taken during the continued implementation of the water loss audit best management practice descriptions of the steps taken are as follows 1a utility system water model was prepared the system model is instrumental in assessing large leakage loss amounts system pressures and confirming pressure zones 2staff will continue to be conservation minded in the operating pressures of the water system the pressures will differ depending on the season topography fire demand and elevated storage tank levels 3the water utilities staff will make regular inspections on water mains fittings and connections to include fire hydrants results are kept as reference for annual updates 4a leak detection program was started including training for all water utilities staff astaff performs leak surveys in addition to the regular inspections of the water mains and connections bleaks are tracked by the utilities department for water loss estimation time from report to repair and volume of leak ccustomer complaints reports of leakage taste and odor and all other complaints are kept on file with the utilities department 5all meter readers and maintenance employees will have training on visual inspections and leak detection a previously implemented citywide meter changeout program has been completed a meter repair and replacement program will continue which includes the following procedures afailed meters will be replaced when located bmeters replaced citys contract with johnson controls have a ten year warranty c2 % of meters will be tested annually to be within 5% accuracy dall municipal connections will be metered for increased accuracy of water use ea street cleaner water use tracking method has been put in place and monitored funauthorized taps or water thefts will be assessed a charge for the illegal tap and disconnection of the illegal tap jwater audits and leak detection 1another aspect to the water audit bmp is the monitoring of monthly consumption all records are kept up to date and monitored for fluctuation the audit system has become a major tool in system management this plan has developed a reliable and effective leak detection program it is estimated unaccounted for water can be reduced by approximately one percent 1% per year the city is aware that assistance in leak detecting surveys can be obtained from the texas water development board twdb staff the twdb has portable leak detection equipment available for loan to municipalities and can provide personnel for demonstration of equipment and assist in planning survey programs 2the city wide meter replacement and aggressive enactment of a stricter detection program has enabled city staff to determine the need for possibly seeking further assistance for the use of electronic equipment when necessary the current detection program consists of the following observations and activities aleaks reported by citizens bleak detection by meter readers ccontinual checking and servicing of production pumping and storage facilities dquick response by water utilities staff to respond to reported problems kindustrial alternate sources and reuse of process water 1area industrial customers were contacted to determine if reuse and recycling is being employed one such water customer kelly & vesuvius inc uses raw untreated water and reuses wastewater by returning it to their product line and reusing it for process again 2however at this time wastewater reuse is not possible by the city of tyler the location of the wastewater treatment plant with relation to industrial users is not conducive the city is not located in an arid section of texas and therefore reuse for irrigation purposes has not been developed lprohibition on wasting water 1the city of tyler ordinance already in place requires water users to be conservation minded when watering and using water whether it is residential or commercial the adopted city ordinance is posted on the citys website during the education bmp the education of the citys customers has been detailed educational materials have been available at the tyler water utilities office and others have been mailed directly to the customer 2a system has been developed to track offenders and include violations compliance notification and other pertinent information compliance notifications are kept up to date to help locate potential theft situations the city of tyler is committed to keep the citizens of tyler educated on the importance of water conservation mindustrial site specific conservation southwest dairies is a large industrial water user within the city of

trane corporation is an industrial business located within the tyler water system trane corp has partial use of the ge elevated water tank for use in their plant this major industrial water consumer uses cooling towers in its process the trane corporation has a policy to periodically modify and replace the cooling towers as necessary the replacement and modification to the cooling towers at the plant increases the efficiency of the systems as it relates to water usage omeans of implementation and enforcement the city manager staff has implemented the conservation plan and best management practices bmp in accordance with city council adoption of the plan updates and included best management practices enforcement will be provided by 1refusing to provide taps for customers who do not meet requirements for water conservation fixtures as established by adopted international plumbing nonpayment of water bills will initiate prompt discontinuation of service service will be
