whittier california  austin texas  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  cleveland ohio  and beaumont texas  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the councils findings include the following 1 that the foregoing cases studies reports and other material are reasonably believed to be relevant to the problems that the city of oconomowoc is seeking to abate and prevent in the future 2 sexually oriented businesses are associated with a wide variety of harmful secondary effects which include but are not limited to the following a illicit drug use illicit and unsanitary sexual activity including prostitution and other unlawful sexrelated offenses as well as other personal and property crimes and offenses  b decreased desirability of and depreciation of property values in surrounding neighborhoods and properties  c health risks associated with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases  and d the potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct 3 alcohol consumption on the premises of a sexually oriented business exacerbates the deleterious secondary effects of such businesses on the community including illegal drug use and illegal sexual activity and encourages undesirable behavior that is not in the interest of the public health safety and welfare 4 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that may be uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments 5 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 6 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses including those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 7 persons frequent certain adult theatres adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 8 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 9 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 10 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses 11 sexually oriented businesses have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them including increased crime and the downgrading of property values 12 sexually oriented businesses in which live totally nude nonobscene erotic dancing occurs may and do generate secondary effects which the governing body believes are detrimental to the public health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city 13 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 14 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 15 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres 16 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this section 17 the findings noted in paragraphs 1 raise substantial governmental concerns c determinations  therefore the common council has determined that sexually oriented businesses should be regulated in order to promote the goal of addressing the negative secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses and that the city has a substantial government interest in regulating such businesses 2 definitions a adult arcade means any place to which the public is permitted or

under s nr  wis adm findings of fact the common council of the city of oconomowoc finds that uncontrolled storm water runoff and construction site erosion from land development and land disturbing activity can have significant adverse impacts upon local water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminish the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled soil erosion and storm water runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing stream bed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperatures  2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loadings of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants  3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and increasing pollutant loads  4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading  5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing runoff volumes and peak flood flows and overburdening

around and outward from the lakes protection of the quality resources remains a top priority land uses within the original central city and surrounding areas along the lakes were developed to take advantage of the economic opportunities that resulted from their location near the resources and providing goods and services to the surrounding community changes in resource management and economics in and around the central city have necessitated an evaluation of the historic development pattern opportunities have been identified that will sustain the economic vitality of the central city and surrounding areas combined with increased protection of the resources development standards set in place to protect the resources applicable to new development would restrict the sustainable use of the previously built development as much of the older parts of the city were divided into parcels and buildings constructed prior to the establishment of any local land use controls to place the same standards on an area with over a century of history that applies to new development is not in the best interest of the general public this chapter of the municipal created to allow redevelopment of
