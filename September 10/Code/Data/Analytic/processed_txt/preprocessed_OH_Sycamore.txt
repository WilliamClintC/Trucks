a base zoning district and those of an overlay district the overlay district regulations control 812 definition a special public interest spi district is defined as a geographic area exhibiting or planned to contain special and distinctive characteristics that are of significant value or importance to the public these characteristics include natural phenomena such as unique geologic strata soil formations slopes vegetation water flow significant scenic views or other similar natural features or have physical development features such as substantial public investment in public improvements or community plans that coordinate public and private investment or have characteristics that include institutional uses or neighborhood support services in residential neighborhoods or village developments in suburban metropolitan areas an spi district shall be classified according to an spi category type and the characteristics of each spi district shall be in accord with the characteristics of its type as described in this purposes the purposes of spi regulations are to assist the development of land and structures to be compatible with a larger planning area beyond the immediate vicinity of the site and to protect or improve the quality of the environment in those locations where the characteristics of the environment or the amount of public investment are of significant public interest and are vulnerable to damage or loss of public opportunity by the cumulative effect of development in such planning areas permitted under conventional zoning regulations spi regulations are required to protect the public and property owners in the district a from blighting influences that might be incrementally caused extended or worsened by the application of conventional land use regulations to properties and areas of sensitive and special public interest  b from significant damage to neighborhoods that contain large institutional and other nonresidential uses or support services  c from significant damage or destruction of prominent wetlands floodplains hillsides andor valleys or other natural resources caused by improper development thereof  d from significant damage to the economic value and efficiency of operation of existing properties andor new developments due to the interdependence of their visual and functional relationships  e from soil erosion stream situation and development on unstable land  f from the loss or destruction of mature andor valuable trees and other natural resources  g from the detrimental cumulative effects of

such additional stories to dwelling structures shall not 1 increase gross dwelling unit densities or floor area as set forth in the approved development plan  2 such heights shall result in appropriate reduction in building coverage and adherence to the objectives set forth in this chapter  and 3 such heights shall not adversely affect surrounding structures 4 accessory uses and structures chapter 9 nonconformaties 91 general provisions 911 purpose this the continued existence of uses structures and lots lawfully established prior to the effective date of this resolution that do not conform to the regulations of this resolution applicable in the zoning districts in which such uses structures and lots are located the continued existence of nonconforming uses is frequently inconsistent with the purposes for which such regulations are established thus their gradual elimination is generally desirable the regulations of this permit such nonconformities to continue without specific limitation of time but are generally intended to restrict further investments in such uses that would make them more permanent or less desirable the regulations also restrict further investment in noncomplying structures and lots of record that would increase the degree of noncompliance this for compatible nonconforming uses that the improvement of a nonconforming use may be desirable in unique circumstances to achieve additional protection of adjacent property and benefit the surrounding neighborhood this recognizes that new standards for landscape buffers height and setback requirements may conflict with the investment backed expectations of owners of developments that existed prior to the adoption of these regulations and therefore allows limited exception from such regulations to minimize the affect of these standards on existing property rights 912 general scope of regulations these regulations apply to the following categories of nonconformities a nonconforming uses of land and of complying structures  b noncomplying structures  c noncomplying lots of record  d compatible nonconforming uses development that was approved asofright prior to the

nothing in this be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of a nonconforming structure in accordance with an order of a public official charged with protecting the public safety who declares such structure to be unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition this is provided such restoration is not otherwise in violation of the various provisions of this the repair or restoration of partial structures or signs 914 nonconforming accessory uses and structures no use structure or sign that is accessory to a principal nonconforming use or structure shall continue after such principal use or structure has been voluntarily discontinued for two 2 years or more unless it shall thereafter conform to all the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located 915 burden of establishing legality of nonconformity the burden of establishing that any nonconforming use lawfully exists under the provisions of this resolution shall in all cases be upon the owner of such nonconformity and not upon the township 916 inventory and notice of nonconforming uses within two 2 years after the effective date of this resolution or any amendment thereto creating new nonconformities or such longer period as may be required the zoning inspector shall inventory all nonconforming uses and determine the names and addresses of the owners of record thereof for each such nonconformity inventoried the zoning inspector shall determine the nature and extent of the nonconformity upon making such determination the zoning inspector shall notify the aforesaid owner or lessee in writing by registered mail of his determination such inventory and notices shall be kept on file by the zoning inspector and shall be a matter of public record the determinations of the zoning inspector made pursuant to this section shall be subject to appeal to the board of zoning appeals pursuant to in the same manner as other rulings and interpretations this not relieve the burden establishing the legality of the nonconforming use from the property owner it also does not relinquish the establishment of a nonconforming use if the inventory is not performed or completed 917 zoning certificate for legal nonconformity the owner of any nonconforming use may at any time apply to the zoning inspector for a nonconforming use zoning certificate to establish the legality of such nonconformity as of a specified date such application shall be filed and processed pursuant to the provisions of any person receiving a notice pursuant to above shall be required within sixty 60 days of the receipt of such notice to apply to the zoning inspector for a nonconforming use zoning certificate with respect to the identified nonconformity unless an appeal from the determination of the zoning inspector has been filed such application shall be accompanied by an affidavit acknowledging the zoning inspectors determination this affidavit shall be kept on file by the zoning inspector and shall be a matter of public record if upon reviewing an application for a nonconforming use zoning certificate for a nonconformity the zoning inspector determines that the use in question was lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of the provision creating the nonconformity in question and remains lawful existing subject only to such nonconformity at the time of such application and that any required affidavit is in order the zoning inspector shall issue a nonconforming use zoning certificate evidencing such facts and setting forth the nature and extent of the nonconformity otherwise the zoning inspector shall decline to issue such certificate and shall declare such use of land or structure to be in violation of this resolution 92 nonconforming uses of land and structures 921 authority to continue any lawfully existing use of land or of any structure which becomes nonconforming amendment of this resolution or the zoning map may be continued so long as no structural alterations are made it may be changed to another nonconforming use or a more restricted use permitted asofright in the zoning district in which it is located 922 nonconforming use
