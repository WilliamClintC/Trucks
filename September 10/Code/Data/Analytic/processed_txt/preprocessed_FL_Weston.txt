pleasing environment for all proposed uses this master plan was developed series of charettes led by arvidajmb partners the developer of weston as part of this charette series arvidajmb partners involved local architects landscape architects inhouse land development and management personnel members of regional planning councils and local agencies as well as a nationally recognized planning consultant rtkl international ltd and marketing consultants the charettes were driven by a desire for town center to be respectful of the adjacent communities as well as to provide necessary services to the community exhibits 1 & 2 this project would be developed in a manner that would be both aesthetically pleasing and functionally responsive within the economic parameters which would make it a successful venture for arvidajmb partners a conceptual design was the final work product of this series of charettes exhibit 3 this conceptual plan integrates compatible uses vehicular circulation pedestrian linkage and shared recreational areas to provide visual and functional continuity for the implementation of town center using this conceptual master plan and the integration of architectural footprints as well as functionally responsive parking and service areas an illustrative master plan is being prepared for town center and will be submitted as part of the city of westons site plan review process all proposed uses paving parking and roadways have been designed considering the highest and best use of the land ease of access and community needs the plan integrates all required stormwater facilities and utilityinfrastructure systems key design criteria used to generate this master plan and critical to the success of town center is the use of shared parking this shared parking criteria is important in order to minimize the amount of asphalt or nonpervious areas within town center and to allow for the concentration of green space to be used for buffering as well as both active and passive public activities while providing the total number of functional parking spaces required by a shared parking analysis use standards the town center core has been divided into major use types exhibit 4 the mix of uses has been established to provide a balanced approach to the project this balance will ensure a consistency of quality provision for market demand

eliminated natural soil profiles  altered the hydrology  and degraded historic wetlands the degraded wetlands have been assessed by the broward county department of planning and environmental protections dpep the south florida water management district sfwmd and the us army corps of engineers acoe the evaluations have established that a total of 1173 acres of mitigation is proposed to compensate for wetland impacts environmental regulatory permits are pending the soil survey of broward county florida eastern indicates that lauderhill muck was historically the primary soil type in the area with a minor component of dania muck see figure 6 in many areas the historic soil profile has been severely altered by past and present land uses both lauderhill and dania muck are characterized as nearly level very poorly drained organic soil underlain by limestone at 20 to 40 inches and 14 to 20 inches respectively the majority of the site is relatively flat with existing ground conditions generally varying from approximately four and onehalf feet ngvd to five and onehalf ngvd historically activities pertaining to mining of the existing quarry site represent the only features having substantial topographical relief such features include the quarry scrape down areas soil and muck wetlands and berms and several lot pads the project is located entirely within the

12512b5ccompact deferral area a compact deferral area is created when a roadway segment or intersection becomes overcapacity or operationally deficient due to the cumulative sum of existing and approved development trips including the proposed development trips for the purposes of the city transportation concurrency review the compact deferral area created by an overcapacity roadway segment is specifically defined as a twomile band having a centerline which is coincident with the centerline of the overcapacity deficient link extending parallel to the overcapacity link for a distance of onehalf mile beyond each endpoint of the overcapacity link the compact deferral area created when an intersection becomes deficient due to unacceptable operations on one or more of its approaches is

the point of intersection of the intersecting roadway centerlines 12512b5dinsignificant impact a development shall be considered to have an insignificant impact on a deficient roadway segment if the

the most current version of the qualitylevel of service handbook prepared by the florida department of transportation for those roadway segments within the city which are included as part of the broward county trips model network the network capacity incorporated in the model shall be used as the average annual daily capacity for the segment the corresponding peak hour directional capacity for roadway segments included in the trips model shall be the peak hour directional service volume from the fdot generalized tables that corresponds to the trips model daily capacity intersection capacities and levels of service shall be based on chapters 9 and 10 of the most current version of the highway capacity manual special report 200 published by the transportation research board of the
