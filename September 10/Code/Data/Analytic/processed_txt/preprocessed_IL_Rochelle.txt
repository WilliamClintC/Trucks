 reserved article vii  planned unit developments purpose a the development and execution of zoning regulations is based upon the division of the city into districts in which the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform it is recognized by the city that new types procedures and relationships in land development are emerging and that the mixing of uses and variations in bulk regulations within districts can produce very satisfactory desirable and lasting results if properly designed and planned without adverse influence upon surrounding property the following standards are established to provide flexibility to encourage sound and imaginative design and to guard against the use of the planned unit development pud technique solely as a means to intensify the use of land a pud is considered to be a subdivision of land b a person by choosing to develop property as a planned unit development elects to submit a contemplated development proposal to a legislative and discretionary review by the planning and zoning commission and city council  10272003  exh b 5122008 objectives the pud as a subdivision of land is intended to encourage improved design in the development of land by providing relief from traditional zoning requirements which may cause undue hardship or complication for desirable but unconventional development and to establish standards and procedures for the issuance of a conditional use permit for a pud in order to achieve the following objectives 1 environmental design in the development of land that is of a higher quality that is normally possible strict application of general zoning ordinance requirements 2 diversification in the use permitted and variation in the relationship of uses structures open spaces and heights of structures in developments conceived as cohesive unified projects 3 provision for functional and beneficial use of open space 4 preservation to the greatest extent possible of the archeological and historic resources and natural landscape features and amenities of a development site and to use such features in a harmonious fashion in the development 5 provision for a safe and desirable environment characterized by a unified building and sensitive site development program 6 economical development in relation to public services 7 creation of a variety of uses in compatible arrangements to provide a greater choice of living employment and shopping environments 8 efficient use of land resulting in more economic networks of infrastructure 9 coordination of architectural styles building forms and relationships graphics and other private improvements  10272003 modification of district regulations puds as subdivisions of land shall be constructed in each zoning district as a conditional use subject to the standards and procedures as follows 1 the pud designation is not intended to be attached to existing zoning districts as an overlay the pud designation as detailed in this article is a separate use district and may be attached to a parcel of land process of land subdivision rezoning and zoning map amendment 2 the ordinance approving the preliminary plat for the pud may provide for such exceptions from the district regulations governing use density area bulk parking signs and the subdivision design standards as may be necessary or desirable to achieve the objectives of the proposed pud provided such exceptions are consistent with the standards and criteria contained in this article no modifications of district requirements or subdivision design standards may be allowed when such proposed modification would result in a inconvenient or unsafe access to the pud b traffic congestion in the streets which adjoin the pud c an undue or disproportionate burden on public parks recreational areas fire and police protection schools and other public facilities which serve or are proposed to serve the pud d a development which will be incompatible with the purpose of this chapter and the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan e alteration destruction or diminution of natural landscape features such as floodplains wetlands fens woodlands prairie rock outcroppings seeps springs or steep slopes f alteration destruction of archeological and historic features 3 the planning and zoning commission may recommend to the city council and the city council may grant a conditional use permit which modifies the applicable district zoning regulations and subdivision regulations upon a written finding by the planning and zoning commission that the pud meets the applicable objectives and standards and criteria contained in this article such written finding shall set out the reasons supporting each finding and shall support each of the following standards and the applicable provisions of section 110432 and sections 110434  10272003  exh b 5122008 general

the city council after a planning and zoning commission public hearing and a recommendation by the planning and zoning commission as provided in this article 5 sanitary sewers storm sewers and water supply to service the development are adequate to serve the proposed development and will not reduce existing capacity below that necessary to serve existing developments or overload local facilities beyond design capacity 6 the location and arrangement of structures parking areas walks lighting and appurtenant facilities are compatible with the surrounding land uses and any part of a proposed development not used for structures parking and loading areas or accessways is landscaped or otherwise improved 7 the project area is adaptable to unified development and shall have within or area no
