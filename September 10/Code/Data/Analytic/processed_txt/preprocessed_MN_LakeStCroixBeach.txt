sometimes allegations that the license or permit holder has violated a statute ordinance or rule which also regulates the proper operation of that activity ccurrent city ordinances do not adequately establish a uniform procedure for the city to determine if a violation has occurred ordinances also do not adequately delineate what remedies are available to the city to ensure that licenses and

whether or not violations have occurred it is the intent of the city council to establish a system which would provide fair and adequate notice to the permitlicense holder of the alleged violation and a hearing before the city council the possible penalties which are provided for are designed to protect the public from future violations specifically the sanctions should deter a violator from

instances particularly various procedures involving county and city administration where the user should refer to the city as to the correct process to be followed general provisions   introduction ageneral introduction 1the city is but one of the land areas making up the saint paul minneapolis seven county metropolitan area its present land use character is varied  as in any area but predominantly it is made of agricultural land units its proximity to the core of the metropolitan area suggests that with the forecasted expansion of population the land use in the city will continue to change as it has in the last 15 years in regard to land use the changes will be in the direction of smaller pieces of land for housing and commercial uses and finally large scale commercial use such as sales office multiple dwelling or concentrated housing developments 2during the course of such change on a large or small scale land holdings are divided into lots with provision for new streets and for the basic utilities such as power telephone water and sewer this conversion of land into building sites is a process which requires careful regulation to ensure an attractive efficient and safe city environment provision must also be made for possible future resubdivision for after the subdivision of a land parcel has been approved and buildings permitted the same standards must be met by future resubdivision the division combination or resubdivision of land parcels are the first step in shaping the physical character of a city and as such are important processes which should be subject to public regulation 3adequate uptodate subdivision regulations as well as good administration and enforcement are the tools to control the change in land use these subdivision regulations must reflect the desire of the city as outlined in its comprehensive development plan because the citys outlook will vary as an area progresses toward urbanization both the comprehensive plan and subdivision regulations need periodic review finally of course the zoning requirements outline the actual land area usage controlled by the subdivision regulations within the framework of the comprehensive plan bwhy plat 1the land use pattern of the city is changing from an agricultural land use which required large parcels of land to an urban land use requiring much smaller parcels land has been bought and sold using metes and bounds descriptions but now with smaller parcels being bought and sold the practice of describing them by metes and bounds is no longer practical 2many metes and bounds descriptions past and present written by unqualified people do not properly describe conveyance of land overlaps and gaps have been created by these poor descriptions and can only be corrected by the courts descriptions based on a good boundary survey can be checked therefore the record plat is a highly desirable instrument the underlying description of the property to be platted can be adjusted or corrected based on a boundary survey the recorded plat then becomes a legal document denoting lots and blocks as the subdivision of the described tract of land clean simple and accurate conveyances can then be made and described as lot block plat name 3the present platting system was established to provide a simple system for keeping records of the division and ownership of land state statutes give the registered land surveyor exclusive rights to prepare plats the statutes also set minimum standards that the surveyor must meet and regulate the plat itself as to information required size number and kind the reader is referred to ms as it may be amended from time to time and the standard procedures for platting in the county chow platting is accomplished 1prior to the preparation of a plat the subdividers or owners should meet with city officials with the planning commission and the city engineer in order to be made fully aware of all applicable ordinances regulations and plans in the area to be subdivided at this time or at a subsequent informal meeting the subdivider should submit a general sketch plan of the proposed subdivision and preliminary proposals for the provision of water supply and waste disposal the sketch plan can be presented in simple form but should show any zoning changes which would be required and should show that consideration has been given to the relationship of the proposed subdivision to existing city facilities that would serve it to neighboring subdivisions and development and to the topography of the site the subdivider is urged to avail himself or herself of the advice and assistance of the planning commission and the city council at this point in order to save time and effort and facilitate the approval of the plat 2the next step is for the subdivider to prepare a preliminary plat for the area to be subdivided the preliminary plat is a very detailed drawing showing the proposed development and necessary accessory information it contains more detail than is required on the sketch plan and serves as the basis for the public hearing it also serves as the master plan for a development where subdividing a piece of land is carried out stepwise by a series of plats where the first plat which is approved and recorded may be only part of the total plan and may later be followed by other plats all in conformity with the overall plan 3after the preliminary plat is approved the subdivider will have his or her surveyor prepare a final plat covering all or part of the land to be subdivided the final plat is a legal document designed primarily to record in the city offices the exact boundaries and location of parcels of land before the city council will approve the plat it will usually require the subdivider to agree to do certain things such as pave streets the city council will make sure that all such matters are agreed to by the subdivider and are covered as necessary by written contract and by bond before the plat is approved 4the following briefly outlines the platting process for the city aprepare sketch plan meet with city officials and the planning commission to discuss zoning requirements and platting procedure bprepare preliminary plat submit seven copies to the county surveyor in order to be placed on the agenda for the county plat commission csubmit preliminary plat to city submit preliminary plat to city officials for review and public hearing after review by the county plat commission dsubmit preliminary plat to watershed district for review and approval if lakeshore property preliminary plat must also be submitted to the state department of natural resources eprepare final plat after the county plat commission and city council has given preliminary plat approval submit copies to the county surveyor and to the county plat commission for approval fsubmit final plat submit final plat to city officials for approval gsignatures and final approval obtain all required signatures and final approval by the county board    purpose athe process of dividing raw land into home sites or separate parcels for other uses is one of the most important factors in the growth of any city few activities have a more lasting effect upon its appearance and environment once the land has been subdivided into urban lots and the streets homes and other structures have been constructed the basic character of this permanent addition to the city has become firmly established it is then virtually impossible to alter its basic character without substantial expense in most subdivisions roads and streets must be maintained and various public service must be provided the welfare of the entire city is thereby affected in many important respects it is therefore to the interest of the general public the developer and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper standards ball subdivisions of land hereafter submitted for approval shall fully comply in all respects with the regulations set forth herein cit is the purpose of these regulations to 1encourage well planned efficient and attractive subdivisions by establishing adequate standards for design and construction  2provide for the health and safety of residents by requiring properly designed streets and adequate sewage and water service  3place the cost of improvements against those benefiting from their construction  4secure the rights of the public with respect to public lands and waters  and 5set
