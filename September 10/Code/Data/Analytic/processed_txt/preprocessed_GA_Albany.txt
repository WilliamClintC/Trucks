section 35 of the original act and replace it with a new subparagraph 5 however the editor has determined that a scriveners error occurred in describing which material of the original act was meant to be amended by the 1970 act because section 35 of the original act did not contain any subparagraphs and subparagraph 5 of section 34 of the original act contained a similar subject matter as the

establishment of a stormwater utility the mayor and board of commissioners makes the following findings of fact a the city of albany is authorized by the georgia constitution of 198 including without limitation paragraphs i and iii thereof and ocga  368262 to provide stormwater management services systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the city of albany hereinafter the city or albany b in promulgating the regulations contained in this section albany is acting pursuant to authority granted by the constitution and laws of the state of georgia and its city charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal a system for the collection conveyance storage treatment and disposal of stormwater services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas c failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff may 1 cause erosion of lands  threaten businesses residences and other facilities with water damage  and may environmentally impair the rivers streams and other bodies of water within and downstream of the city 2 adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the city of albany thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system 3 contribute to the potential degradation of the quality of both surface water and groundwater resources d the city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years the future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city and the additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city in order to do so the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for implementation of its comprehensive stormwater management program and drainagerelated capital improvement needs e the city is required under federal and state regulations ie the federal clean water act the citys national pollutant discharge elimination system hereinafter npdes phase ii stormwater permit to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 into state of georgia or united states waters therefore it is appropriate for the city to establish a stormwater utility and impose a stormwater user fee charge upon improved properties that may discharge directly or indirectly into the public ms4 or receive stormwater services from the city either directly or indirectly whether or not the property is private or public in nature f compliance with the regulatory obligations of the citys npdes phase ii stormwater permit the citys wastewater treatment permits the national flood insurance program nfip and the other applicable regulatory programs will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services systems and facilities above what is currently being spent for stormwater management program implementation water quality management drainage system maintenance floodplain management capital construction and other program activities g the cost of operating and maintaining the citys stormwater management system and the funding of necessary repairs replacements improvements and extensions thereof should to the extent practicable be allocated in relationship to the services received from the citys stormwater management program h the due diligence work financial analysis and related documents prepared by the citys stormwater consultant properly assesses and defines the citys stormwater management program problems needs goals priorities and operational costs as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy i given the stormwater management programs needs goals priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater management services systems and facilities within the city in concert with other water resource management programs j stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city while specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time a stormwater management system and service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city of albany is consistent with the present and future needs of the community k the stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs and risk exposure it is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management to improved properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the citys stormwater management program which results in services being provided to such properties the fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the user fee charge correlates to the stormwater management services provided to that property and the runoff demand that the property imposes on the public drainage system and the citys stormwater management program l the stormwater management needs in the city include but are not limited to protection of the public health safety and welfare of the community provision of stormwater management services renders andor results in both a service and a benefit to all properties property owners businesses citizens and residents of the city in a variety of ways even though the benefits may be indirect or immeasurable m a stormwater management program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city and the most equitable means to implement an enhanced level of service for stormwater management service delivery within the city user fee charges user fees and other mechanisms n the amount of impervious surface on each improved property is the most important factor influencing stormwater runoff characteristics and these characteristics bear a rational nexus to the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future to that property as a result the amount of impervious surface on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge o a schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city stormwater utility user fee charges may be designed with specific modifiers to further enhance customer equity as well as customer understanding of the user fee charge rate structure while at the same time minimizing the citys customer account management and maintenance efforts p stormwater utility user fee charges may be supplemented by other types of fees and charges which address specific needs including but not limited to special service fees special assessments revenue bonds use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes splost and other forms of revenue as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city commission q the existence of privately owned and maintained onsite stormwater control facilities activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the citys stormwater management program and the stormwater utilitys cost of providing stormwater management services andor stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or a credit and such reduction or credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such services systems facilities activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems facilities activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the reduction and mitigation of the stormwater runoff impacts from the property r it is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services systems or facilities together with any other supplemental revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services systems or facilities be dedicated solely to those purposes and such proceeds of user fee charges and supplemental revenues shall therefore be deposited into the city of albany stormwater utility enterprise fund and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital operating and nonoperating costs lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes in accordance with applicable sections of the aforementioned master trust indenture s in order to protect the health safety and welfare of the public the governing authority of the city of albany hereby exercises its authority to establish stormwater utility user fee charge rates for the provision of stormwater management services

shall be on the southerly sides of roads and odd numbers shall be on the northerly sides of roads 4 even numbers shall be on the easterly sides of roads and odd numbers shall be on the westerly sides of roads 5 roads which are not traveling due northsoutheastwest or that meander shall be numbered as a northsoutheastwest road if the major portion of the road within the county runs northsoutheastwest once a northsoutheastwest road has an address number assigned to structures then that road shall always be considered to be a northsoutheastwest road 6 address numbers south of the baseline shall be affixed with the prefix south and address numbers north of the baseline shall be affixed with the prefix north to avoid duplication of address numbers the above also applies to east and west streets b fractional alphanumeric and hyphenated addresses there shall be no use of fractional addresses alphanumeric address numbers or hyphenated address numbers this also applies to

used throughout the entire length of the road the orientation will not change even if the road changes direction within developments it is advisable to consider the direction of the beginning of the road if it originates off a northsouth road and begins by going eastwest before meandering northsouth it is generally considered an eastwest road e circular streets a circular streetroad is one that returns to the same origin point or to the same originating road circular streets shall be numbered beginning at the low numbered intersection and continuing to the other end of the road the outside of the circle is numbered first and the inside is then numbered mix and matched with the outside this will result in most cases with fewer numbers on the inside of the circle and with larger spaces between inside numbers the numbering sequences of the outside and inside of the circle shall be used throughout the entire length of the road f culdesacs culdesacs shall be addressed using the system based on the baselinemeridian structure with oddeven numbers on the appropriate sides of the street and meeting at the midpoint or the back of the culdesac g corner lots it is preferable for corner

undevelopable no more than one such drive shall be approved per subdivision development and must be approved as part of the original plat 8 listed thoroughfares listed thoroughfares to which driveway access is restricted or limited by these regulations are included in appendix 2 and regulated as follows a where a subdivision for singlefamily and twofamily lots will abut or contains any of the thoroughfares listed in appendix 2 the planning commission shall require that such singlefamily and twofamily lots not have direct vehicular access to such listed thoroughfares except in the cases of 1 subdivisions of property to accommodate the residential needs of family members of the owner of a large tract of land  in which case minimum frontages are to be as close to that required by exception 3 below as practical  however when such frontage cannot be met the planning commission may upon the recommendation of the county director of public works or such person as may be directed to act as the county traffic engineer approve lesser frontages and driveway spacing as low as that permitted in exception 4 below  2 when there are particular and unusual physical conditions not caused by the owner which would result in a hardship as distinguished from a mere inconvenience  3 where any lot created will have a minimum frontage of 200 feet and only one driveway per lot  or 4 where the subdivision will have minimum lot frontages of 200 feet for all corner lots and 150 feet for all noncorner interior lots and the plat will contain restrictive covenants requiring the use of joint common or abutting driveways or parallel driveways which are no more than six feet from the property line generally this would mean that lots should not front said listed thoroughfares  however any design solution which satisfies the intent of restricting direct vehicular access to such thoroughfares would be acceptable potential design solutions to achieve this purpose include i use of marginal access streets wherein land abutting a listed thoroughfare is separated from such thoroughfare by a planted or grassed strip of land and a marginal access street  ii use of reverse frontage lots wherein lots back up to a listed thoroughfare and front on and have access only to a local or minor collector street running approximately parallel to the listed thoroughfare such reverse frontage lots shall have a noaccess reservation at least 15 feet wide along their rear property line and immediately adjacent to any abutting listed thoroughfare  iii using one or more culdesacs ushaped streets or short looping streets wherein lots front and only have access to such streets and those streets are only entered from and generally designed at right angles to a street not a listed thoroughfare and laid out approximately parallel to any listed thoroughfare  and iv other such design solutions as may be devised to achieve the same results the use of deep lots with rear service alleys and a no access reservation along the front of the lot or the use of culdesacs ushaped streets or short looping streets having direct access to a listed thoroughfare is not considered a good solution and should be approved only when unique circumstances make other solutions unacceptable where a commercial or industrial subdivision will abut or contain a listed thoroughfare the planning commission may require the use of such design standards as listed above b any lot on a designated listed thoroughfare but not a state highway which is to be used for residential purposes containing

article 1  statutory authorization findings of fact purpose and objectives authorization section ii of the constitution of the state of georgia and a of the official georgia annotated ocga  36120a have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the mayor and board of commissioners of albany georgia does ordain as follows findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city of albany are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages statement of purpose it is the intent of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage and  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands objectives the objectives of this ordinance are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines street and bridges located in floodplains  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  7 to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area and  8 to insure that flood insurance will continue to be available to the residents of albany

corridor protection criteria 1 purpose and applicability in 199 the general assembly passed the mountain and river corridor protection act which called for the department of natural resources dnr to develop criteria for the protection of important river corridors within the state of georgia these criteria apply to all perennial rivers or streams with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second as defined by the united states geologic survey in december 199 the board of natural resources adopted these river corridor protection criteria a subsequent amendment of the minimum planning standards and procedures for local comprehensive planning approved by the board of community affairs in april 1992 requires all local governments to address these river corridor protection criteria within their comprehensive plans as they apply to rivers and streams in their municipal boundaries within dougherty county the flint river and kinchafoonee creek are subject to the river corridor protection criteria kinchafoonee creek joins the flint river just south of lake chehaw from this point the flint river flows southward eastern part of dougherty county effectively dividing dougherty county into two parts and also dividing the city of albany the primary purposes of the river corridor protection criteria are to protect water quality reduce erosion encourage the protection of wildlife habitats and reduce the risk of flood damage to properties near major rivers therefore the protection criteria require the establishment and maintenance of a 100foot natural vegetative buffer containing flora and fauna native to the area the 100foot wide buffer consisting of the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the rivers low water line shall be treated by local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the river corridor protection plan because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering riverbank erosion and jumping of channels the river corridor may shift with time for the purposes of these criteria the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period of local comprehensive plans any shift in the location of the protected river after the start  ii  30 of the review period will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next review by the department of community affairs 2 permissible uses a land use existing prior to the promulgation of a river corridor protection plan b single family dwellings including the usual appurtenances are permitted within the buffer area subject to the following conditions i the dwelling shall be in compliance with all local zoning regulations ii no more than one 1 dwelling shall be located on a tract of land containing at least two acres not including any area that lies within the river corridor iii a septic tank serving such a dwelling may be located within the buffer area iv septic tank drainfields shall not be located within the buffer area v construction of road crossings and utility crossings provided that construction of such road and utility crossings shall meet all requirements of the erosion and sedimentation control act of 197 and of any applicable local ordinances on soil erosion and sedimentation control c timber production and harvesting are subject to the following conditions i forestry activity shall be consistent with best management practices established by the georgia forestry commission  and ii forestry activity shall not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal clean water act as amended d wildlife and fisheries management activities e recreational usage consistent either with the maintenance of a natural vegetative buffer or with river dependent recreation for example a boat ramp would be consistent with this criterion but a hardsurface tennis court would not parking lots are not consistent with this criterion paths and walkways within the river corridor are consistent with this criterion f natural water quality treatment or purification g agricultural production and management subject to the following conditions i agricultural activity shall be consistent with the best management practices established by the georgia soil and water conservation commission  ii agricultural activity shall not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal clean water act as amended  and iii agricultural activity shall be consistent with all state and federal laws and all regulations promulgated by the georgia department of agriculture h mining activities if permitted by the department of natural resources pursuant to the georgia surface mining act of 196 as amended i utilities if such utilities cannot feasibly be located outside the buffer area and provided that i the utilities shall be located as far from the river bank as reasonably possible  ii installation and maintenance of the utilities shall be such as to protect the integrity of the buffer area as well as is reasonably possible  and iii utilities shall not impair the drinking quality of the river water  ii  31 j other uses permitted by the department of natural resources or under of the clean water act for all of the above uses the natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land disturbing activity within the river corridor these uses are permissible upon compliance with all local state and federal laws currently in effect 3 prohibited uses the following uses are prohibited a except as provided in connection with permitted single family dwellings septic tanks and septic tank drainfields are prohibited b handling areas for the receiving and storage of hazardous waste are prohibited port facilities are exempt from this criterion provided that i port facilities shall meet all federal and state laws and regulations for the handling and transport of hazardous waste and ii port facilities handling hazardous waste shall perform their operations on impermeable surfaces having spill and leak protection systems as prescribed by the department of natural resources c hazardous waste or solid waste landfills are prohibited d other uses unapproved by the citycounty shall not be acceptable within the river corridors ____________________________________________________________________________ 1 river bank shall mean the rising ground bordering a river which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow 2 river corridor shall mean all land inclusive of islands not regulated under the metropolitan river protection act o>cga 125440  or the coastal marshland protection act ocga 125280  in areas of a protected river and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks article 9 wetland and stream corridor protection criteria dougherty county only a purpose and applicability the quality of urban and rural streams reflects the quality of land management and land development activities within the watershed reducing the amount of disturbance and impervious surfaces adjacent to watercourses is one of the best methods to reduce the quantity of nonpoint source pollutants in these watercourses and wetlands  this is done by allowing stormwater pollutants to infiltrate the soil before they reach the water resource conventional zoning ordinances generally do not mitigate these problems to a sufficient degree and therefore are not considerate enough of the impacts on environmental resources and in turn the quality of life and health of the communitys residents zoning of the built environment generally requires setbacks for buildings and rights of way for streets  ii  32 and roads however wetlands and streams do not enjoy the same protection these resources not only serve natural systems but directly affect the quality of life of the human environment by providing clean water a critical element of human health economy and general wellbeing these streams and wetlands do not exist apart from their surrounding upland areas they are intertwined in a dynamic link to create balance in a natural system therefore as part of an overall watershed protection strategy it is not enough to protect the wet areas of wetlands and streams protection must also be extended to the contiguous upland areas of those hydric systems as well protection should be provided all natural streams and wetlands in dougherty county streams to be buffered will be identified as the first solid blue line on a 75 minute usgs quadrangle map freshets and intermittent streams will not be included in the ordinance all jurisdictional wetlands will be buffered and will be identified by at least one of the following 1 the central dougherty plain advance identification of wetlands us epa draft technical summary document  2 those wetlands identified by us army corps of engineers documents or by private contractor certified in wetland delineation by the us army corps of engineers 3 the national wetlands inventory published by the us fish & wildlife service b buffers and permitted uses a lateral threetier system will establish buffer width and will permit increasing levels of activities within the entire stream or wetland buffer zone these zones are outlined as follows 1 the streamside zone protects the physical and ecological integrity of the stream ecosystem the vegetative target is mature riparian forest that can provide shade leaf liner woody debris and erosion protection to the stream the width is 25 feet 100 feet on rivers with a mean annual flow of 400 cfs or more per the requirements of the mountain and river corridor protection act 199 measured from each stream bank bank being defined as that adjacent uppermost part of the land adjacent to the watercourse that serves to contain it this distance equals about one or two mature trees growth from the streambank land use in this zone will be highly restricted limited to stormwater channels footpaths and a few utility or roadway crossings in this zone those areas previously developed or improved will be hereafter undisturbed  vegetation in this zone will be left to develop eventually creating a mature forest typical of this region and soil conditions 2 the middle zone extends from the outward boundary of the streamside zone and is also 25 feet wide its key functions are to protect key components of the stream and provide further distance between upland development and the stream the vegetative target for this zone is also mature forest but some clearing may be allowed for stormwater management access and recreational uses a wider range of activities and uses are allowed within this zone eg recreation bike paths and  ii  33 stormwater bmps 3 the outer zone can practically be considered the buffers buffer and is an additional 25foot setback from the outer edge of the middle zone to the nearest permanent structure in most instances this will be a residential backyard the vegetative target for the outer zone is usually turf or lawn however the property owner is encouraged to plant trees and shrubs in this area thereby increasing the total width of the buffer very few uses are restricted in this zone gardening lawns etc are promoted in this zone but septic systems and permanent structures are prohibited in the event that a landowner disputes a determination by the permitting agency concerning buffer width andor identification of the stream bank the property owner has the option of retaining a wetland scientist andor a certified land surveyor to delineate the buffer widths and distances c hardships property owners may make use of three mitigation options if they feel they have been unduly impacted by the provisions above they are as follows 1 buffer averaging  this approach allows some flexibility in the width of the buffer as long as the streamside zone is not impacted where the width of the buffer must be compromised on one part of the property the width will be made up in another part that is the buffer will be wider at the mitigation point and narrower at the variance point 2 density compensation  this method grants a developer a credit for additional density elsewhere on the site in compensation for developable land that has been lost due to the buffer requirement developable land is defined as the portion of buffer area remaining after the wetland streamside or steep slope areas has been subtracted credits will be granted when more than 5% of developable land is consumed the density credit is accommodated at the development site by allowing greater flexibility in setbacks frontage distances or minimum lot sizes to squeeze in lost lots cluster development provisions would also allow the developer to recover lots that are taken out of production due to buffers and other requirements 3 conservation easements landowners should be afforded the option of protecting lands within the buffer by means of a perpetual conservation easement the easement conditions the use of the buffer and can be donated to a land trust as a charitable contribution that can reduce an owners tax burden alternatively the conservation easement can be donated to the county in exchange for a reduction or elimination of property tax on the parcel in order for this provision to become a bona fide option the county or some other appropriate agency or body must organize a land trust d appeals property owners may request a variance from these provisions process outlined in title iii of the zoning must demonstrate severe economic hardship or unique
