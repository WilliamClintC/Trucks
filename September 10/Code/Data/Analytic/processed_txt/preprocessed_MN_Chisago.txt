16001 findings declaration policy purposes a the city of chisago city has financed in part the construction of a sewer system which reasonably serves the needs of the residents of chisago city and those extraterritorial users currently connected this sewer system has been financed by service charges on current users and general levies on property within the city at the time of construction and bond retirement b because the city of chisago city and surrounding areas are now undergoing strong growth and development pressure increased numbers of requests for sewer system hookups are being received by residents of the areas served by the water system facilities appear unavoidable c since the need for new or substantially modified facilities is almost entirely created by future hookups to the sewer system it seems only just to make provisions for financing this sewer system expansion largely by those who are creating a need for it d a sewer system hookup charge hereafter referred to as the hookup charge or sewer access charge sac along with area trunk charges in the judgment of the city council offers the best means of assuring that additional necessary capacity will be within the financial means of this city and that users who have already paid for a sewer system sufficient for their needs will not be charged for capacity provided to serve others 16002 definitions unless

purposes of these regulations are the following 2 to preserve woodlands and trees on individual sites  protect the safety of said residents by preventing wind and water erosion slope instability and rapid runoff promote the health of said residents by absorption of air pollutants contaminants and noise  and protect the welfare of residents by increasing rainfall infiltration to the water table provide a diversified environment for many kinds of animals and plants necessary for wildlife maintenance and important to the aesthetic values and recreational requirements of the area and promote
