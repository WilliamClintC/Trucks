justice center for prostitution resources minneapolis minnesota and from sexually oriented businesses an insiders view by david sherman presented to the michigan house committee on ethics and constitutional law jan 12 200 and the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses june 6 1989  state of minnesota the city council finds 1sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the unlicensed operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism in this city to make the owners and operators of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on then premises 2some employees of unregulated sexually oriented businesses defined in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at unregulated sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4offering and providing unregulated space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5some persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses or for the purpose of purchasing or selling illicit drugs 6numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis salmonella campylobacter and shigella infections chlamydial myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections trichomoniasis and chancroid 7according to research from the kaiser family foundation an estimated 650000 to 900000 americans are infected with hiv the number of new hiv infections occurring each year is now about 41000 men and women of all races are most likely to be infected by sexual contact 8as of december 2004 there were 9320 reported aids cases in arizona with 114 reported cases in yuma county as of february 2008 there were 12677 reported cases of hivaids in arizona and 153 cases in yuma county according to the arizona department of health services 9the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that as many as one in three people with hivaids do not know they are infected 10the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 of 1990 between 2001 and 200 the number of reported primary and secondary syphilis cases increased 124% according to the 2009 annual report concerning sexually transmitted diseases in arizona as made by the arizona department of health services arizona had a rate of 232 cases per 100000 population for primary and secondary p&s syphilis 11the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level and the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that more than 700000 persons in the us get new gonorrheal infections each year only about half of these infections are reported according to the 2009 annual report concerning sexually transmitted diseases in arizona as made by the arizona department of health services there were 3251 gonorrhea cases in arizona 12the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts see eg findings of us dept of health & human services 14sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 16the findings noted in division b1 15 above raise substantial governmental concerns 17sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonablyregulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further the a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 20requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in the establishments 21the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of the uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and will prevent the further secondary effects of dissemination of illegal obscenity child pornography and to minors materials harmful to them 22it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23the fact that an applicant for an adult use has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 24the barring of these individuals from employment in sexually oriented businesses for a specified period of years serves to prevent distribution of illegal material to prevent conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases and to preclude the establishment of criminal enterprises within the city 25the general welfare health morals and safely of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter passed 1282010  11302 definitions for
