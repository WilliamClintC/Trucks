in the federal register the npdes program as 164 authorized by the 1972d amendments to the clean water act controls water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge pollutants into waters of the united states phase ii of the npdes requires permit coverage for stormwater discharges from regulated small municipal separate storm sewer systems ms4s and for small construction activity that results in the disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre this federal regulation went into effect  in response to phase ii of npdes the indiana department of environmental management enacted rule 12 327 iac 1513 and revised rule 5 327 iac 155 under these new state and federal regulations the won is required to establish a regulatory mechanism for regulating stormwater quality management passed 152005  000551004 findings the town storm water board finds that a water bodies roadways structures and other property within and downstream of town are at times subjected to flooding b flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is also a danger to the natural resources of the region c land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes increased flooding increased stream channel erosion and increased sediment transport and deposition d soil erosion resulting from landdisturbing activities causes a significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported offsite and deposited i ditches streams wetlands lakes and reservoirs e increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes and the sediments and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects within town will absent reasonable regulation and control adversely affect the towns water bodies and water resources f pollutant contributions from illicit discharges within the town will absent reasonable regulation monitoring and enforcement adversely affect the towns water bodies and water resources g stormwater runoff soil erosion nonpoint source pollution and illicit sources of pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation of stormwater management h adopting the standards criteria and procedures contained and referenced in this chapter and implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects of stormwater runoff and illicit discharges i adopting

have to be further reduced if depressional storage exists at the site sitespecific release rates must be calculated according to methodology described in the stormwater technical standards manual accounting for the depressional storage by modeling it as a pond whose outlet is a weir at an elevation that stormwater can currently overflow the depressional storage area post developed release rate for sites with depressional storage shall be the twoyear predeveloped peak runoff rate for the postdeveloped tenyear storm and tenyear predeveloped peak runoff rate for the postdeveloped 100yar storm in no case shall the calculated sitespecific release rates be larger than general release rates provided above b also note that for determining the postdeveloped peak runoff rate the depressional storage must be assumed to be filled unless the stormwater board andor the permitting officer can be assured easement that the noted storage will be preserved in perpetuity 3 management of offsite runoff a runoff from all upstream tributary areas offsite land areas may be bypassed around the detentionretention facility without attenuation such runoff may also be bypassed detentionretention facility without attenuation provided that a separate outlet system or channel is incorporated for the safe passage of such flows ie not primary outlet of a detention facility unless the pond is being designed as a regional detention facility the primary outlet structure shall be sized and the invert elevation of the emergency overflow weir determined according to the onsite runoff only once the size and location of primary outlet structure and the invert elevation of the emergency overflow weir are determined by considering osite runoff the 100year pond elevation is determined by routing the entire inflow onsite and offsite pond b note that the efficiency of the detentionretention facility i controlling the onsite runoff may be severely affected if the offsite area is considerably larger than the onsite area as a general guidance online detention may not be effective in controlling onsite runoff where the ration of offsite area to onsite area is larger than  additional detention above and beyond that required for onsite area may be required by the stormwater board andor the permitting officer when the ratio of offsite area to onsite area is larger than  4 downstream restrictions a

store that portion of the runoff exceeding the capacity of the receiving sewers or watercourses when such downstream restrictions are suspected the stormwater board andor the permitting officer may require additional analysis to determine the receiving systems limiting downstream capacity b if the proposed development makes up only a portion of the undeveloped watershed upstream of the limiting restriction the allowable release rate for the development 183 shall be in direct proportion to the ratio of its drainage area to the drainage area of the entire watershed upstream of the restriction

the potential for soil erosion by designing a development that fits the topography and soils of the site deep cuts and fills in areas with steep slopes should e avoided wherever possible and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible 2 existing natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible areas immediately adjacent within 35 feet of top of bank to watercourses and lakes also should be left undisturbed wherever possible unvegetated or vegetated areas with less than 70% cover that are scheduled or likely to be left inactive for 15 days or more must be temporarily or permanently stabilized with measures appropriate for the season to reduce erosion potential alternative measures to site stabilization may be acceptable if the project site owner or their representative can demonstrate they have implemented and maintained erosion and sediment control measures adequate to prevent sediment discharge from the inactive area 190 3 all activities on a site should be conducted in a logical sequence so that the smallest practical area of land will be exposed for the shortest practical period of time during development 4 the length and steepness of designed slopes should be minimized to reduce erosion potential drainage channels and swales must be designed and adequately protected so that their final gradients and resultant

town of cumberland does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations 334  001515202 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the town of cumberland are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated inadequately floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages  001515203 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands f make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program  001515204 objectives the objectives of this ordinance are a to protect human life and health b to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public 335 d to minimize prolonged business interruptions e to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains f to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  001515205 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be
