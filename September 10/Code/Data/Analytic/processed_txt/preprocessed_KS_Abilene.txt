recommendation of the planning commission is based using the following guidelines a whether the change in classification would be consistent with the intent and purpose of these regulations b the character and condition of the surrounding neighborhood and its effect on the proposed change this entails a description of the neighborhood as to existing land uses intensity of development age and general condition of structures c whether the proposed amendment is made necessary because of changed or changing conditions in the area affected and if so the nature of such changed or changing conditions d the current zoning and uses of nearby properties and the effect on existing nearby land uses upon such a change in classification the zoning surrounding the property at issue along with the actual uses on those properties is to be considered e whether every use that would be permitted on the property as reclassified would be compatible with the uses permitted on other property in the immediate vicinity consideration is to be given as to whether each of the permitted uses under the proposed rezoning would be compatible with existing uses the focus is upon issues which can be addressed via zoning such as structure height yards and setbacks and minimum lot sizes f the suitability of the applicants property for the uses to which it has been restricted how the property at issue is presently zoned and the uses permitted under that zoning is to be considered as well as whether those uses are appropriate given the zoning of the surrounding neighborhood also to be considered is whether the presently allowed uses are the only uses appropriate for the subject property g the length of time the subject property has remained vacant or undeveloped as zoned consideration is to be given as to whether the subject property is vacant because its present zoning is unsuitable or whether it is vacant for reasons unrelated to zoning eg a surplus of similarlyzoned property problems with financing lack of infrastructure or other development problems h whether adequate sewer and water facilities and all other needed public services exist or can be provided to serve the uses that would be permitted on the property if it were reclassified i the general amount of vacant land that currently has the same zoning classification proposed for the subject property particularly in the vicinity of the subject property and any special circumstances that make a substantial part of such vacant land available or not available for development j the recommendations of professional staff and advisors staff recommendations should be based upon the factors set out in this section the adopted comprehensive plan other adopted plans and reports and the evidence in the record k whether the proposed amendment would be in conformance to and further enhance the implementation of the citys comprehensive plan the question here is whether the requested rezoning is consistent with the recommendations of the adopted comprehensive plan if it is not is the incompatibility because the plan is outdated or have conditions changed in the area or neighborhood of the subject property l whether the relative gain to the public health safety and general welfare outweighs the hardship imposed upon the applicant by not upgrading the value of the property by such reclassification this factor acknowledges that the basis for zoning is protection of public health safety and welfare any rezoning request involves balancing the property owners interests with the interests of the public m such other factors as the planning commission may deem relevant from the facts and evidence presented in the application 26109 applications for conditional use permit because of particular conditions associated with their activities certain uses which might have an adverse effect upon nearby properties or upon the character and future development of a district are not permitted outright in districts but are allowed as conditional uses when their proposed location is supplemented by additional requirements so as to make the use requested compatible with the surrounding property the neighborhood and the zoning jurisdiction 26110 factors to be considered in permit applications the planning commission may recommend approval of a conditional use that is expressly authorized to be permitted in a particular zoning district and the governing body may approve such conditional use using the following factors as guidelines the explanation of these factors as set out in for rezonings shall also be considered in conditional use permit applications a whether approval of the conditional use would be consistent with the intent and purpose of these regulations  b whether the location of the proposed use is compatible to other land uses in the surrounding neighborhood  c whether the proposed use places an undue burden on the existing public infrastructure in the area affected and if so whether additional infrastructure can be provided  d whether the proposed use is made necessary or desirable because of changed or changing conditions in the area affected  e the length of time the subject property has remained vacant or undeveloped as zoned  f whether the applicants property is suitable for the proposed conditional use  g the recommendations of professional staff and advisors  h whether the proposed conditional use would be in conformance to and further enhance the implementation of the citys comprehensive plan  i whether the proposed conditional use if it complies with all the conditions upon which the approval is made contingent will not adversely affect the property in the area affected  j for such uses as solid waste disposal facilities including sanitary landfills construction and demolition landfills and transfer stations whether the proposed conditional use is consistent with any adopted solid waste management plan of dickinson county and amendments thereto  and k such other factors as the planning commission may deem relevant from the facts and evidence presented in the application conditional use permits 26201 the application notice public hearing and action procedures set forth in this be applicable to all applications for conditional use permits submitted after the effective date of
