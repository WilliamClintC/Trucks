management   144102 statement of findings the governing body of the municipality finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance and development throughout a watershed increases flooding flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces infiltration and groundwater recharge increases nonpoint source pollution to waterways and threatens public health and safety b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance and development throughout a watershed can harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c a comprehensive program of stormwater management including minimization of impacts of new development redevelopment and other earthdisturbance activities causing accelerated runoff and erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety and general welfare of the people of the municipality and all of the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater is an important water resource that provides infiltration and groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by reducing the volume of stormwater generated and by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality infiltration stream base flow and aquatic ecosystems costeffective and environmentally sensitive stormwater management can be achieved use of nonstructural site design techniques that minimize impervious surfaces reduce disturbance of land and natural resources avoid sensitive areas eg riparian buffers floodplains  144101 general provisions  144102   144103 purpose the purpose of

and rapid change and recognizes the applicability of the objectives set forth in of act 247 the pennsylvania municipalities planning 53 ps  10701 et seq b therefore the specific intent of this article is to88 1 encourage innovations in residential development and renewal so that the growing demand for housing may be met by greater variety in type design and layout of dwellings and by the conservation and more efficient use of open space ancillary to said dwellings  2 provide greater opportunities for better housing and recreation for all who are or will be residents of the township  3 encourage a more efficient use of land and public service and to reflect changes in the technology of land development so that the economies so secured may enure to the benefit of those who need homes  4 encourage more flexible land development which will respect and conserve natural resources such as streams lakes floodplains groundwater wooded areas steeply sloped areas and areas of unusual beauty or importance to the natural ecosystem  5 encourage innovations in residential developments that are designed to minimize energy consumption and maximize recycling of materials in their layout transportation climate control energy sources and solid and liquid waste treatment systems  and 6 provide a procedure which can relate the type design and layout of residential development to the particular site and the particular demand for housing existing at the time of development in a manner consistent with the preservation of the property values within existing residential areas and to assure that the increased flexibility of regulations over land development established hereby is carried out pursuant to sound expeditious and fair administrative standards and procedures 88editors

applied to the base density calculation any use of bonus density shall be subject to compliance with the performance standards of  170904a3 in no case shall the maximum total density exceed 15 dwelling units per acre of tract area notwithstanding the ability of the applicant to potentially justify further density increase based on provisions in  170904a2a andor b below a for every 5% of the gross area of the tract that is permanently preserved as common open space above the minimum established under  170904c below and meeting the criteria of  170904a3 the maximum density may be increased by  dwelling units per acre for example if 50% of the gross area of a tract in the r1 district proposed to be developed for singlefamily detached dwellings is provided as common open space representing an addition of two increments of 5% each 40 + 5 + 5 then the maximum density may be increased to 125 dwelling units per acre 11 +  +  b in addition a maximum density bonus of up to 03

than other types of residential development and less impacts upon the public school system and a lower average number of residents per dwelling unit and therefore that a higher density is justified for this type of development than other types of residential development  2 to provide for residential developments that meet the growing needs of older persons including the need for quality housing fellowship oversight open space and recreation facilities  3 to encourage innovations in residential development so that growing demand for housing may be met by greater variety in type design and layout of dwellings and by conservation of open space within such a development in a manner that serves important public purposes   1701614 westtown code  1701615  4 to encourage flexibility in site planning which will respect and conserve natural resources such as streams ponds floodplains groundwater wooded areas steeply sloped areas and areas of significant beauty or importance to the natural ecosystem  to seek to incorporate key scenic views into site designs  5 to encourage more efficient use of land and public services  6 to provide for patterns of development around the perimeter of a tract that are compatible with neighboring development and the townships planned trails and greenway system while allowing greater flexibility within the interior of the tract  7 to recognize that the impacts of higher density developments can be offset by substantial public improvements by a developer the preservation of important open spaces and careful site design  and 8 to maintain the scenic
