as exhibit a to this chapter such official airport land use & height overlay zoning map may be amended from time to time and all notations references elevations data zone boundaries and other information thereon is hereby adopted as part of this ordinance 16608 airport zoning requirements in accordance with iowa there are three 3 principal airport zoning requirements supported by additional information contained within the following remaining sections of this chapter these basic zoning requirements state 1 all airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter shall be reasonable and none shall impose any requirement or restriction that is not necessary to make effective the purposes of this ordinance a airport zoning regulations adopted under this ordinance may require the removal lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or tree or a change in use not conforming to the regulations when adopted or amended b airport zoning regulations adopted under this ordinance may require a property owner to permit the city of onawa andor monona county to install operate and maintain on the property markers and lights as necessary to indicate to operators of aircraft the presence of the airport hazard when adopted or amended 2 all such regulations may provide that a preexisting nonconforming structure tree or use shall not be replaced rebuilt altered allowed to grow higher or replanted so as to constitute a greater airport hazard than it was when the airport zoning regulations or amendments to the regulations were adopted the city of onawa or the city and monona county in conjunction will be responsible for the initial removal of trees structures or other natural or manmade obstructions that are not conforming to the regulations of this ordinance when adopted or amended any subsequent alterations or removal of any natural or manmade obstructions to the airport or its airspace will be responsibility of the property owner 16609 nonconformities it is the intent of this ordinance to permit legal nonconforming buildings structures or natural resources to continue until they are removed but not to encourage their continuance unless such nonconforming use is determined by the faa to be a hazard within one of the airport zones and must be altered or changed in accordance with faa regulations it is further the intent of this ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon expanded or extended nor be used to add other nonconforming structures prohibited elsewhere in the defined airport zones in accordance with iowa stated above in any preexisting nonconforming structure tree or land use shall not be replaced rebuilt altered allowed to grow higher or replanted so as to constitute a greater airport hazard than it was when the airport zoning regulations or amendments to the regulations were adopted with that stated where a lawful building or structure exists prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that cannot be built under the terms of this airport chapter by reason of restrictions on height or land use compatibility such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful and in compliance with faa regulations  subject to the following provisions 1 no such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way that does not increase its nonconformity 2 should such nonconforming structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent 50% of its replacement cost it shall be reconstructed only in conformity with the provisions of this airport ordinance 3 should any nonconforming structure be moved within the boundaries of any of the five 5 airport zones for any reason or for any distance whatever it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of this airport zoning ordinance 4 discontinuance in the event a nonconforming building structure or use is discontinued for a period of two 2 years the height or land use compatibility shall conform thereafter to the provisions of this airport zoning ordinance on any nonconforming building or structure work may be done on ordinary repairs or replacement of nonbearing walls not exceeding fifty percent 50% of the assessed value of the building provided the cubic content of the building shall not be increased nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety upon orders of such official there may be a change of tenancy ownership or management of any existing nonconforming uses of land buildings or structures 16610 land use safety zones far surfaces and runway protection zones have been combined to create five 5 airport overlay zones these five zones are designed to maintain compatible land uses around the airport the zones shall be evaluated for compatible land uses specific dimensions for the individual zones for each runway end are noted in the following tables and text the airport land use & height overlay zoning maps should be evaluated to determine the specific area of impact associated with each zone 1 zone a  runway protection zone rpz zone a is intended to provide a clear area that is free of aboveground obstructions and structures runway protection zones rpzs formerly known as clear zones were originally established to define land areas below aircraft approach paths in order to prevent the creation of airport hazards or development of incompatible land use as stated in the iowa airport land use guidebook 200 the faa adopted clear zones with dimensional standards to implement a recommendation from the 1952 presidents airport commission study that identified the establishment of clear areas beyond runway ends was deemed worthy of federal management rpzs are designed with the intent to protect people and property on the ground they are located at the end of each runway and should ideally be controlled by the airport control is preferably exercised by acquisition of sufficient property interest to achieve and maintain an area that is clear of all incompatible land uses objects and activities table 1 zone a  dimensional

that a specific runway has and the typesize of aircraft utilizing the runway the approach surface is longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extends outward and upward from the end of the primary surface the inner edge of the approach surface is the same width as the primary surface and expands uniformly table 2 below illustrates the various sizes of zone b based upon the specific runway criteria a portion of zone b is overlain by zone a because the approach surface and rpz overlap the entire length of the rpz consequently the length of zone b begins at the inner edge

surface zone c includes those areas that are parallel to the runway pavement and extend 1050 feet from the edge of the primary surface paralleling the runway and extended runway centerline until they reach the end of zone a at a 90 degree angle the specific dimensions for zone c are based upon various options for the primary surface that is predicated upon the type of approach and critical aircraft the transitional surface zone c extends outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and extends at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each onefoot vertically  from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces the transitional surfaces extend to the point at which they intercept the horizontal surface at a height of 150 feet above the established airport elevation 4 zone d  horizontal surface zone d is typically elliptical in shape depending upon the runway types and configurations at individual airports the horizontal surface is a horizontal plane located 150 feet above the established airport elevation and encompasses an area from the transitional surface to the conical surface the perimeter is constructed by generating arcs from the center of each end of the primary surface and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs the radius of each arc for all runway ends designated as utility or visual airports is 5000 feet 5 zone e  conical surface zone e is the outermost zone of the airport overlay zoning areas and has the least number of land use restriction considerations the zone begins at the edge of the horizontal surface and is 4000 feet in width paralleling the horizontal surface according to the iowa airport land use guidebook the conical surface extends upward and outward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 feet horizontally for every one foot vertically  for a horizontal distance of 4000 feet height limitations for the surface range from 150 feet above the airport reference elevation at the inner edge to 350 feet at the outer edge 16611 land use zone compatibility the need to plan for compatible land use near airports is not a new concept compatible land use was recognized as early as 1952 in a document entitled the airport and its neighbors  the report of the presidents airport commission as stated in the iowa airport land use guidebook the incidence of incompatible land uses and impact on airport operations and development have escalated as decisions to allow incompatible land uses near airports threaten the nations aviation system implementation of compatible land use controls have become an industry priority it is important for the onawa airport to maintain an obstructionfree airport and associated airspace this includes the area that encompasses the airport runway protection zones approach areas and general vicinity of the airport while some of these areas are owned by airports the bulk of the land beyond airport boundaries is privately owned and needs to be managed by the local municipality andor county in which the airport jurisdiction falls faa criteria such as grant assurances and design guidelines along with aviation accident statistics provide the foundation and the justification for compatible land uses the above stated definition defined in the iowa airport land use guidebook appears vague since no specific land use types are specified however the vagueness is intentional because nearly every type of land use can be both compatible and incompatible depending upon the particular aspects of the land use including management of the land use location of the land use relative to the airport for example land uses typically considered to be compatible with airport operations include commercial industrial and agricultural activities with that said each of these uses may also contain aspects considered incompatible such as  commercial uses may have dense concentrations of people  industrial uses that can generate smokesteam that creates visual obstructions  agricultural operations can act as wildlife attractants in certain circumstances the city of onawa and monona county must each and collaboratively assess the compatibility of the land uses in detail as related to the airport descriptions of land use issues include high concentrations of people tall structures visual obstructions and wildlife and bird attractants lastly land use compatibility is critical to the airport because certain grant assurances are required as part of a project application from airports that are eligible to request federal funds upon acceptance of grant money these assurances are incorporated into and become part of the grant agreement the airport sponsor is obligated to comply with specific assurances which include the maintenance of compatible land use within the vicinity of the airport specifically grant assurance 21 included in the september 1999 amendment to 49 usc 471 requires all airports that accept federal money to take appropriate action against incompatible land uses in the immediate vicinity of the airport such actions include adopting zoning laws and zoning changes that will increase airport land use compatibility this grant assurance obligates an airport sponsor to protect the federal investment maintenance of a safe operating environment the development of compatible land uses near airports is supported comprehensive planning that includes faa standards land use compatibility is a requirement for eligibility to receive faa grant money for airport improvements adjacent land uses that are not compatible with airports may result in the loss of federal or state funding for airports the following tables shall be utilized to evaluate land use compatibility for various land use classifications 1 uses identified as compatible shall not require additional review  however consideration should be given to the following areas of concerns high concentrations of people tall structures visual obstructions or wildlife and bird attractants 2 uses found to be not compatible shall be precluded from development within the specific zones the applicant reserves the right to apply for a variance for an incompatible use to be built within the requested airport zone and in accordance with faa requirements variances will be reviewed by the airport board of adjustment 3 uses found to require additional review shall be evaluated for general compatibility by the onawa zoning administrator for potential conflicting land uses or potential negative affects that may need to be mitigated if the areas of concern are addressed by the applicant the airport zoning administrator shall recommend issuance of the zoning permit if no areas of potential conflicting uses or incompatible land uses are identified or need to be mitigated the airport zoning administrator shall proceed to recommend issuance of the zoning permit onawa airport zone  land use chart c
