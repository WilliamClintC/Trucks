it is not the purpose or intent of these regulations to require removal or alteration of any existing structure or tree or to require the cessation or alteration of a use that is lawfully in existence when these regulations become effective however it is assumed nonconforming uses will not continue forever25 the following provisions are designed to reasonably address nonconforming uses or structures or trees 1 documentation of uses and structures or trees within the airport boundary and critical area the administrative officer shall document to the best of the officers ability and within a reasonable time after adoption of these regulations those existing uses of land and the existence of structures or trees found in the aaa within the airport boundary and critical area with an

which contains a nonconforming use after destruction or substantial damage which affects that use may be prohibited any addition to or remodel of a structure containing a nonconforming use requires a variance under these regulations b nonconforming structures or trees existing structures or trees may continue to exist but their expansion or additional growth is prohibited unless a variance is obtained under the provisions of these regulations 2 substantial damage to a nonconforming use substantial damage occurs when eighty percent 80% or more of a structure or tree is deteriorated or decayed or when that structure or tree has been torn down or destroyed27 the administrative officer has the authority to determine substantial  sterling codifiers inc  282283 damage a substantially damaged structure or tree which is nonconforming may not be reconstructed or replaced without first obtaining variance under the provisions of these regulations and then obtaining a permit 3 maintaining nonconforming trees after identification of trees in place at the time these regulations become effective the county or city as the case may be may trim those trees at its expense to maintain their heights at the time of identification28 4 marking nonconforming trees or structures if the county or city as per jurisdiction elects to install operate and maintain at its own expense
