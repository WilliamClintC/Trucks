finds that persons and organizations have been visiting private residential properties as well as privately owned businesses for the purpose of soliciting sales of goods wares merchandise or services 2 some residents and business owners find these commercial activities to be intrusive upon their privacy 3 the city council further finds that a variety of misrepresentations and other frauds are at times employed in such commercial activities 4 unregulated doortodoor commercial solicitation constitutes a serious concern for the city 5 the goal of protecting residents and private business owners from fraud and crime and thereby promoting the safety and privacy of residents within the city and its police jurisdiction is a legitimate urgent and substantial governmental interest 6 the city has a substantial interest in preventing fraudulent or criminal activities which may result from unregulated commercial solicitation 7 the city has a substantial interest in protecting individuals safety and privacy by reasonably limiting the hours of commercial solicitation and setting those hours consistent with those recognized to be customary at retail commercial establishments within the city and its police jurisdiction and requiring the registration and permitting of commercial solicitors in a content neutral manner 8 the city has a substantial interest in allowing individuals to determine their level of comfort with privacy and whether or not they want to receive solicitation 9 noncommercial speech is entitled to broader protection under the first amendment to the united states constitution than commercial speech affording the city greater ability to regulate commercial speech than noncommercial speech 10 all of these goals and interests may properly be served by this narrowly tailored regulation which requires commercial solicitors to obtain a permit prior to soliciting within the city or its police jurisdiction reasonably limits the hours of activities and prohibits solicitation of occupants of properties where signs have been posted prohibiting such activities 11 by adopting a registration system for commercial solicitations that identifies solicitors and requires basic background information from them the city can limit the exposure of its citizens to fraud and misrepresentation and prevent persons with a history of violent crime from conducting solicitations 12 some minor commercial transactions incidental to otherwise noncommercial activities are of a completely different character than the types of commercial solicitations targeted by this article thus the council has consciously provided an exemption for sales by youth in support of educational charitable and community activities with the intent of protecting such traditional activities as cookie and candy sales b the purpose of this article is to balance free speech and expression with the health safety and welfare of the residents of the city and its police jurisdiction

95319534 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from art 1  c and d art 2 art 3  ah art 4  ad and art 5  ad of an ordinance adopted sept 18 198 and an ordinance adopted  cross reference

state of alabama has in title 11 title 41 of the alabama 197 authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city of monroeville alabama does ordain as is set out in this chapter 2 findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of monroeville alabama are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities 2 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  2 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  3 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion  4 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and 5 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters 2 objectives the objectives of this chapter are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  3 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  4 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  5 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  6 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  and 7 to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area 2 lands to which this chapter applies this chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of monroeville alabama 2 basis for area of special flood hazard the areas of special flood hazard identified by the federal emergency management agency in its flood insurance study fis dated  with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto are adopted by reference and declared a part of this chapter for those land areas acquired by a municipality the current effective fis and data for monroe county are hereby adopted by reference areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a fis such as the flood prone areas identified on the map prepared by goodwyn mills and cawood inc and adopted by the city planning commission on  2 establishment of development permit a development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities 2 compliance no structure or land shall hereafter be located extended converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations 2 abrogation and greater restrictions this chapter is not intended to repeal abrogate or impair any existing ordinance easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this chapter and another conflict or overlap whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail 2 interpretation in the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be 1 considered as minimum requirements  2 liberally construed in favor of the governing body  and 3 deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes 2 warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations larger floods can and will occur  flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes this chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages this chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city of monroeville or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder 2 penalties for violation violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a misdemeanor any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than five hundred dollars $50000 or imprisoned for not more than thirty 30 days or both and in addition shall pay
