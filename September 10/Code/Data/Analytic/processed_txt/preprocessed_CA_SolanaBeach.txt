at the end of its useful life maximum extent practicable or mep means the technologybased standard established by congress in cwa p3biii for storm water that operators of ms4s must meet technologybased standards establish the level of pollutant reductions that dischargers must achieve typically by treatment or by a combination of source control and treatment control bmps mep generally emphasizes pollution prevention and source control bmps primarily as the first line of defense in combination with treatment methods serving as a backup additional line of defense mep considers economics and is generally but not necessarily less stringent than bat a definition for mep is not provided either in the statute or in the regulations instead the definition of mep is dynamic and will be defined by the following process over time municipalities propose their definition of mep by way of their runoff management programs their total collective and individual activities conducted pursuant to the runoff management programs becomes their proposal for mep as it applies both to their overall effort as well as to specific activities eg mep for street sweeping or mep for ms4 maintenance in the absence of a proposal acceptable to the san diego water board the san diego water board defines mep in a memo dated  entitled definition of maximum extent practicable elizabeth jennings senior staff counsel swrcb addressed the achievement of the mep standard as follows to achieve the mep standard municipalities must employ whatever best management practices bmps are technically feasible ie are likely to be effective and are not cost prohibitive the major emphasis is on technical feasibility reducing pollutants to the mep means choosing effective bmps and rejecting applicable bmps only where other effective bmps will serve the same purpose or the bmps would not be technically feasible or the cost would be prohibitive in selecting bmps to achieve the mep standard the following factors may be useful to consider aeffectiveness will the bmps address a pollutant or pollutant source of concern bregulatory compliance is the bmp in compliance with storm water regulations as well as other environmental regulations cpublic acceptance does the bmp have public support dcost will the cost of implementing the bmp have a reasonable relationship to the pollution control benefits to be achieved etechnical feasibility is the bmp technically feasible considering soils geography water resources etc the final determination regarding whether a municipality has reduced pollutants to the maximum extent practicable can only be made by the regional or state water boards and not by the municipal discharger if a municipality reviews a lengthy menu of bmps and chooses to select only a few of the least expensive it is likely that mep has not been met on the other hand if a municipal discharger employs all applicable bmps except those where it can show that they are not technically feasible in the locality or whose cost would exceed any benefit derived it would have met the standard where a choice may be made between two bmps that should provide generally comparable effectiveness the discharger may choose the least expensive alternative and exclude the more expensive bmp however it would not be acceptable either to reject all bmps that would address a pollutant source or to pick a bmp based solely on cost which would be clearly less effective in selecting bmps the municipality must make a serious attempt to comply and practical solutions may not be lightly rejected in any case the burden would be on the municipal discharger to show compliance with its permit after selecting a menu of bmps it is the responsibility of the discharger to ensure that all bmps are implemented motor vehicle means any automobile car truck bus motor home or other selfpropelled vehicle used or suited to use for onroad transportation  and any

of solana beach storm water standards manual and guidance documents 1the city of solana beach storm water standards manual provides guidance requirements and choices for compliance methods authorized enforcement officials may provide additional flexibility using the guidance documents authorized below 2any authorized enforcement official under the supervision of the city engineer may prepare disseminate and maintain guidance documents addressing the use of pollution prevention practices and bmps for specific activities or facilities illegal connections and illegal disposal these guidance documents may set out additional compliance alternatives that in specified circumstances can provide the same environmental protection that is afforded by the bmps required by this chapter or specified in the city of solana beach storm water standards manual these guidance documents may also identify practices that have been determined by the authorized enforcement official to be additional bmps that may be implemented for land disturbance activities and land development activities to prevent or control pollution to the maximum extent practicable mep these additional bmps shall become mandatory for affected dischargers only after being adopted into the city of solana beach jrmp unless an order is issued pursuant to subsection h of this section authorized enforcement officials may also take these guidance documents into account when determining whether any practices used by a discharger or proposed in a grading plan a swppp an enforcement settlement offer or any other submittal to the city are bmps that will prevent or control pollution to the mep these casespecific discretionary decisions may involve circumstances that were not anticipated when general guidance documents were prepared therefore these guidance documents do not confer rights on dischargers in these circumstances and do not constrain the discretion of authorized enforcement officials where appropriate and provided the same protection is provided to the environment authorized enforcement officials may depart from these guidance documents when making casespecific decisions authorized by this chapter hsignificant sources of pollutants authorized enforcement officials shall identify discharges and categories of facilities and activities that are a significant source of contaminants to waters of the united states despite compliance with this chapter if any such contamination problem identified by the authorized enforcement official involves more than five identified sources having similar characteristics the authorized enforcement official shall propose appropriate amendments to this chapter to better control contamination at issue if the contamination problem identified by the authorized enforcement official is limited to fewer than five identified sources the appropriate dischargers shall be ordered by the authorized enforcement official to install implement and maintain additional bmps to prevent or reduce contamination in storm water and nonstorm water to the mep any such order shall specify a reasonable date by which those bmps must be put in place a failure to install implement or maintain additional bmps as required by any such order is a violation of this chapter idetermining whether a discharge is tributary to an impaired water body areas within which facilities and sources will be presumed to be tributary to an impaired water body are as defined in sbmc  and as identified by the swrcb and rwqcbs most recent list of impaired water bodies the presumption that a discharge is tributary to an impaired water body can be overcome for a particular discharge based on specific facts and analysis presented by a discharger in making a sitespecific determination as to whether a discharge is tributary to an impaired water body consideration may be given to the amount of water and pollutant discharged  to whether the pollutant is volatile or degradable  and to whether the pollutant is substantially removed during transport by any natural or manmade features sinks infiltration areas ponds or impoundments vegetated swales or wetlands media filtration devices and similar features located between the site and the impaired water body any such analysis must consider common mechanisms for pollutant mobilization remobilization and transport over time any such analysis and determination shall be disclosed for public review and comment to the extent required by ceqa or by city procedures for permit issuance jcollection and use of storm water an authorized enforcement official may modify any requirement imposed by this chapter to allow the onsite collection and use of storm water or the collection or storm water for delivery to and use at citydesignated sites provided the modified requirements are enforceable and provide equivalent environmental protection       discharge prohibitions aillegal discharges illegal

reimbursements procedures for the levy collection and disposition of fees rtcip fee administrator  title this chapter shall be known as the solana beach regional transportation congestion improvement program  2008  findings in adopting this chapter the city council of the city of solana beach finds and determines that athe city is a member agency of the san diego association of governments sandag a joint powers agency consisting of the city the county of san diego and the 17 other cities situated in san diego county acting in concert the member agencies of sandag developed a plan whereby the shortfall in funds needed to enlarge the capacity of the regional arterial system of highways and arterials in san diego county the regional arterial system could be made up in part by a transportation uniform mitigation fee on future residential development as a member agency of sandag the city participated in the preparation of a certain rtcip impact fee nexus study dated  the nexus study prepared pursuant to california government et seq the mitigation fee act bthe city council has been informed and advised and finds that future development within san diego county and the cities therein will result in traffic volumes exceeding the capacity of the regional arterial system as it presently exists cthe city council has been further informed and advised and finds that if the capacity of the regional arterial system is not enlarged the result will be substantial traffic congestion in all parts of san diego county and the city with unacceptable levels of service throughout san diego county by 2030 dthe city council has been further advised and so finds that funding in addition to those fees adopted pursuant to the nexus study will be inadequate to fund construction of the regional arterial system absent implementation of a regional transportation improvement plan rtcip fee based on the nexus study existing and known future funding sources will be inadequate to provide necessary improvements to the regional arterial system resulting in an unacceptably high level of traffic congestion within and around san diego county and the city ethe city council has reviewed the nexus study and finds that future development within the county and city will substantially adversely affect the regional arterial system and that unless such development contributes to the cost of improving the regional arterial system the regional arterial system will operate at unacceptable levels of service fthe city council finds and determines that the failure to mitigate growing traffic impacts on the regional arterial system within san diego county and the city will substantially impair the ability of public safety services police and fire to respond the failure to mitigate impacts on the regional arterial system will adversely affect the public health safety and welfare gthe city council further finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the use of the rtcip fee and the type of development projects on which the fees are imposed because the fees will be used to construct the transportation improvements that are necessary for the safety health and welfare of the residential and nonresidential users of the development projects on which the rtcip fee will be levied hthe city council finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the need for the improvements to the regional arterial system and the type of development projects on which the rtcip fee is imposed because it will be necessary for the residential users of such projects to have access to the regional arterial system such development will benefit from the regional arterial system improvements and the burden of such development will be mitigated in part by the payment of the rtcip fee ithe city council further finds and determines that the cost estimates set forth in the nexus study are reasonable cost estimates for constructing the regional arterial system improvements and that the amount of the rtcip fee expected to be generated by new development will not exceed the total fair share cost to such development jthe city council further finds that the cost estimates set forth in the nexus study are reasonable cost estimates for the facilities that comprise the regional arterial system and that rtcip fee program revenues to be generated by new development will not exceed the total fair share of these costs kthe fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used to help pay for the construction and acquisition of the regional arterial system improvements identified in the nexus study the need for the improvements is related to new development because such development results in additional traffic thus creating the demand for the improvements lthe city council finds that the nexus study proposes a fair and equitable method for distributing a portion of the unfunded costs of improvements to the regional arterial system mthe city council adopts the nexus study and incorporates it in this chapter as though set forth in full  2008  definitions for the purpose of this chapter

building wall nor more than 20 feet in length parallel to the building wall and are no deeper than 28 inches above the finished floor shall be calculated as exposed perimeter but need not be continuous with the exposed side or sides of the building iiibasement  attached to garage notwithstanding subsection c4aii of this section to the contrary if the floor area of the basement level having an exposed side which is contiguous with not more than one side and not more than 40 percent of the perimeter of that level is constructed for use as vehicle parking eg a functioning garage door is installed garage and residential living area is on the same level and contiguous with the floor area of the garage then the two percent formula set forth in subsection c4aii of this section shall not apply to the floor area of the residential living area on that level the floor area of the residential living area eg nongarage floor area on that level shall be excluded from the calculation of far if a at least 500 square feet is attributed to the garage notwithstanding the actual floor area of the garage b the garage is permanently separated from the residential living floor area of that level eg separated by floortoceiling structural walls with the exception of doorways or openings sufficient for passage walls and c there are not any exposed side or sides of the portion of the level designed for residential living area where any portion of the finished floor over the floor area of that level at any point is more than three feet above the adjacent natural or finished

establish water use standards for landscaping in the city that implement the 2006 development landscape design requirements established by the act and amended by executive order no b2915 consistent with the legislatures findings the purpose of this chapter is to apromote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that integrate and go beyond the conservation and efficient use of water bestablish a structure for planning designing installing maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that requires crosssector collaboration of industry government and property owners to achieve the many benefits possible cpromote the use when available of tertiary treated recycled water for irrigating landscaping duse water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied water allowance mawa as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use for landscaping to the lowest practical amount eencourage water users of existing landscapes to use water efficiently and without waste flandscapes that are planned designed installed managed and maintained with the watershed based approach can improve californias environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability goals such landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face of climatic extremes consistent with the legislative findings and purpose of the conditions in the urban setting will be improved by 1creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing compaction incorporating organic matter that increases water retention and promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon storage oxygen production shade habitat and aesthetic benefits 2minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water requirements reducing reliance on petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides and planting climate appropriate shade trees in urban areas 3conserving water by

 appeal costs maintenance and repair of defense structures use of city beach and other public property during construction landscaping irrigation and drainage violations severability  supplemental provisions  findings and declarations the city council of the city of solana beach hereby makes the following legislative findings and declarations athe beach and tidelands of the city are an important public resource preservation of an aesthetically pleasing shoreline area is important to protect the beach as a public resource and preserve its appeal as a recreational facility and tourist attraction the purpose of this chapter is to create a regulatory framework which balances the protection of vested private property rights and important public interests in shoreline resources which can be harmed by the construction of coastal bluff protection measures bthe shoreline of solana beach is characterized by a narrow strip of sandy beach at the foot of coastal bluffs at the tops of these bluffs private residences and other structures have been built because of the narrowness of the beach and lack of a sand buffer the bluffs are subjected to erosion from wave action particularly during the winter months erosion has also resulted from irrigation practices storm water drainage construction activity and climbing activities unless properly regulated seawalls revetments bluff retaining walls erosion control devices rip rap cave filling or plugging and other similar shoreline and coastal bluff protection measures individually and cumulatively may adversely impact the shoreline when permitted such devices should be designed constructed and maintained in a manner that has the least impact on the shoreline and public use of the beach while providing adequate protection to the bluff top structures and uses cthe california coastal act contains provisions which allow the construction of seawalls revetments bluff retaining walls and other similar shoreline and coastal bluff protection measures when necessary to protect existing structures and when consequential damage to the shoreline can be minimized public resources  the scenic and visual qualities of coastal areas are considered a resource of public importance therefore the coastal act also contains policies which require that new development be located and designed to minimize the alteration of natural land forms and to be visually compatible with the character of surrounding areas public resources  under the coastal act state and local governmental agencies and entities with power and authority to implement the coastal act are charged with the responsibility to resolve conflicts between policies of the act in a manner which on balance is most protective of significant coastal resources public resources  this chapter is intended to enact local coastal policies consistent with the provisions of the act in adopting this chapter the city council in a manner consistent with the policies and goals of the coastal act has attempted to balance the rights and privileges of private property owners to preserve protect develop and use property with the rights of the public to assure protection of important public resources and the need to assure that development designed to preserve or enhance one property does not adversely affect another property dthe san diego association of governments sandag has adopted a shoreline preservation strategy that establishes certain objectives and strategies for the preservation of coastal resources in the county of san diego the city council has considered the shoreline preservation strategy adopted  in the development of this chapter in particular the city council finds that this chapter does the following things as recommended by the shoreline preservation strategy minimizes construction on beaches and in front of seacliffs  protects property from storm waves flooding and seacliff erosion by permitting subject to regulation certain types of shoreline defense structures  requires persons desiring to install shoreline defense structures to mitigate adverse impacts resulting from the construction including without limitation impacts on the environment aesthetic impacts and impacts on the publics use of the beach and other property subject to a public trust additionally the city council finds that this chapter and other city ordinances and regulations address other shoreline preservation strategies by establishing setbacks from seacliffs and imposing blufftop erosion management measures such as irrigation controls restrictions on grading of blufftops and seacliff faces and restrictions on drainage over blufftops and seacliff faces the city council finds that these city ordinances and regulations constitute part of the citys contribution to a cooperative costeffective regionwide shoreline management strategy  and that the city intends to continue working together with other local state and federal governments and agencies to develop this strategy and to seek financial support for it epreservation and enhancement of the beach is an important city goal during the preparation of the local coastal plan required pursuant to the california coastal act the city will develop and adopt policies goals and implementation measures to preserve and enhance beach sand levels the city will also support regional efforts to manage beach sand fregulating the use of seawalls revetments bluff retaining walls and other similar structures is consistent with the solana beach general plan safety element policy 4b discourages the use of seawalls gthis chapter is not intended and shall not be construed to authorize the granting or denial of a permit in a manner which will take or damage private property for public use without payment of just compensation  1994  policy athe safety element of the citys general plan provides that the city shall discourage the use of seawalls goal 32 objective 40 policy 4b the open space and conservation element of the citys general plan provides that the city shall require new developments to be subjected to visual impact analyses where potential impacts upon sensitive locations are identified and further shall require that new structures and improvements be integrated with the surrounding environment to the greatest possible extent goal 32 objective 30 policy 3a and 3b therefore it is the policy of the city council of the city of solana beach to strictly regulate the construction of new seawalls revetments bluff retaining walls gunite covering metal or wood armoring and other similar shoreline defense structures such protection measures generally will not be allowed when other feasible shoreline or coastal bluff protection measures are available permits for the construction of seawalls revetments bluff retaining walls gunite coverings metal or wood armoring and other similar structures will be issued only when necessary to accomplish one of the following purposes 1to protect existing legally built structures on property when the structure or structures are threatened with imminent danger or destruction from bluff failure due to erosion and other methods of protecting the structure or structures are not feasible and the benefit of protecting the structure as opposed to removing it outweighs the adverse impact resulting from the construction of the protective device  or 2to preserve economically viable use of property when it is demonstrated that without the proposed protection measure the property could not be used for any economically viable purpose and other methods of protecting or economic usefulness of the property are not feasible  or 3to abate a public nuisance when other methods of abatement including but not limited to removal of a structure or improvement would result in a severe economic hardship to the owner of private property or the loss of a significant public benefit bshoreline protection measures such as seacave plugging and filling are preferred over the construction of seawalls bluff retaining walls gunite covering and similar permanent armoring permits for seacave plugging and filling will be expeditiously processed and will generally be permitted or conditionally permitted to be constructed in accordance with the design criteria of this chapter plugging and filling of caves is acceptable as a reasonable measure to prevent erosion and minimize effects that could result in a future need to construct a more intrusive protection device crip rap sand bags armoring revetments and other temporary bluff protection measures shall be permitted only on a temporary basis to respond to an emergency dit is the further policy of the city that applications for permits under this chapter be processed expeditiously to the extent such processing is consistent with the protection of the public interest and the preservation of private property  1994  coastal act

caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses cit is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publically and privately owned land within floodprone mudslide or floodrelated erosion areas these regulations are designed to 1protect human life and health  2minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4minimize prolonged business interruptions  5minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  7ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  8ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 9minimize property damage din order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for 1restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  2requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  4controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5preventing or regulating
