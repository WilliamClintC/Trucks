effects of sexually oriented businesses conducted in los angeles california  palm beach county florida  daytona beach florida  toledo ohio  austin texas  amarillo texas  and by the texas city attorneys association  and based on the paper rural hot spots the case of adult businesses by richard mcleary  and based on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota  and based upon the public hearing that council held on  the council finds that 1 the legislature of the state of texas has determined that unrestricted operation of sexually oriented businesses may be detrimental to the public health safety and welfare of a community by contributing to the decline of neighborhoods and contributing to the growth of criminal activity  and 2 there is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them causing increased crime such as the possession or use of controlled substances the proliferation of drugrelated activity prostitution disorderly conduct vandalism robberies and assaults  and 3 regulating the appearance of the premises of sexually oriented businesses and regulating the signage of such businesses preserves the value of neighboring properties and protects minors from exposure to sexual materials  and 4 licensing sexually oriented businesses is a legitimate and reasonable means of regulation to ensure that operators of sexually oriented businesses do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal activities  and 5 charging a fee for a sexually oriented business license is necessary to offset costs of inspections investigations and enforcement  and 6 sexually oriented businesses due to their nature have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other thereby contributing to urban blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent area b further the council hereby states that the purpose of this article is to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to control their negative secondary effects in the community the purpose is not to deny access to or deny

potential projectiles and erosion potential the following provisions shall apply 1 encroachments are prohibited including fill new construction substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge 2 if section 4643 above is satisfied all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of sections 4641 thru 4647 3 under the provisions of 44 cfr of the national flood insurance program regulations a community may permit encroachments

criterion as shown on the effective flood insurance rate map in selected reaches of the floodplains are hereby designated as the floodway fringe for example base flood elevation equals two 2 feet ngvd and the depth criterion equals three 3 feet then the floodway fringe property would be that which is at or above 20  3   17 ngvd these fringe areas may be developed or otherwise filled above the base flood elevation without performing an analysis of impact on flood levels however levee systems or other continuous fills in the floodway fringe exceeding five hundred 500 feet in any dimension or forming a potential barrier to the movement of waters during the occurrence of the base flood are not permitted unless hydrologic and hydraulic analyses certified by a registered professional engineer demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one 1 foot at any point within the community no development including fill may be placed within designated floodways natural stream channels or other floodplain areas not designated as floodway fringe unless a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis certified by a registered professional engineer demonstrates that no increase in base flood elevations throughout the watershed will occur since ao and ah zones do not have floodways this would not apply prior to granting a permit for the construction of a structure designed for purposes of human occupancy the floodplain administrator or another responsible community official must conduct an on site visit and review where the depth of flooding would equal or exceed one and onehalf 15 feet or where access roads would be inundated by depths greater than one and onehalf 15 feet the purpose of the visit and review is to assess the availability of suitable evacuation routes and emergency services capability during the occurrence of the discharge of the 100year flood where there would be a danger to health andor safety with regard to evacuation and emergency services the development permit request should be denied  11788  6

chapter is to establish requirements for the placement installation and maintenance of commercial and personal signs in order to preserve and protect the health safety welfare and general wellbeing of the communitys citizens as the regulation of the placement construction and maintenance of buildings and structures is a valid use of the police power so too is the regulation of the placement installation and maintenance of signs since such signs in the literal sense must ordinarily be considered structures and in a practical sense are capable of producing many of the same nuisances as are produced by buildings b the regulation of the placement installation and maintenance of signs is further justified by the signs innate scheme and primary purpose to draw mental attention to its content potentially to the detriment of sound driving practices and the safety of the motoring public to whom a majority of signs are oriented therefore it is the intent of this chapter to regulate the size and location of commercial and personal street signs such that their purpose can be served without unduly interfering with motorists and causing unsafe conditions c finally it is the objective of this chapter to protect and preserve the aesthetic qualities of the community by regulating the placement installation and maintenance of street signs the fact that such graphics are intended to command visual contact recognizes that the signs are important in determining the overall aesthetic quality of the community d the aesthetic impact of commercial and personal signs is an economic fact which may bear heavily upon the enjoyment and value of property  therefore the regulation of the signs is validly justified on the basis of conserving the value of property and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the city it is contended that it is not irrational for a communitys citizens to plan their physical surroundings in such a way that unsightliness is minimized e with this purpose in mind it is the intention of this section to authorize the use of graphics which are 1 compatible with their surroundings 2 appropriate to the type of activity to which they pertain 3 expressive of the identity of the individual proprietors or of the community as a whole 4 legible in the circumstances in which they are seen  5212007 violation and

substantial and rapid changes and recognizing the applicability of the objectives set forth by the city council does hereby adopt this article for application to areas of land which are to be developed as planned residential developments b of primary concern is the need to provide increased flexibility in the laws governing the development of those large areas in the city which are at present substantially open land  and to encourage such development in directions that will recognize both the changes in design and technology in the building industry and the new demands in the housing market  and to ensure that the uniform regulations appropriate to previously developed residential neighborhoods do not operate to discourage efficient and imaginative development of such substantially open areas consistent with the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring properties c also of concern is the need for the redevelopment of those congested and blighted areas abutting the central areas of the city in order to furnish adequate housing facilities in proximity to the commercial and civic amenities of the central areas of the city and in the belief that private investment should be encouraged to contribute to that redevelopment  and in recognition that such necessary redevelopment cannot be expected to take place in strict accordance with those uniform regulations
