athe prairie fire design overlay district is intended to create a sense of place and individual identity of this development area application of design guidelines and standards prairie fire is a reflection of this areas environmental heritage in the prairie landscape as well as the dynamic and rejuvenating effect fire has in that environment the city hopes that this becomes an area of excitement invigoration and restoration presently the district is a blank slate that has potential of being developed into a highquality area that residents take pride in and visitors take note of these guidelines and standards rely on the natural environment as well as landscaping infrastructure and wayfinding signage that is being implemented by the city to guide new architectural design sign design and site planning in the district bthe prairie fire design overlay district is located south of interstate 80 at exit 168 because of its location south of the interstate and away from the downtown this area will most likely be automobile oriented with pedestrian activity coming from future trail systems in the area it is important that these design guidelines are implemented consistently as future development occurs to create an identifiable area that is highly visible from the interstate cwhile the city wants to encourage development styles which complement the surrounding natural environment public infrastructure and other private buildings the purpose of the design district is not to create an entirely homogeneous area the city encourages the pursuit of individual business identity within these guidelines 2011    boundaries the boundaries of the prairie fire design overlay district are shown on the map in figure 1 the city zoning map also indicates where the prairie fire design overlay district is the boundaries include clockwise the city limits line on the eastern and southern boundaries the airport property line a line even with east 28th street south the ns section of rusty wallace drive interstate 80 the property line of the existing park and south 13th avenue east as the city incorporates additional land into its limits in the future the boundaries will most likely change and expand 2011    goals and principles agoals the prairie fire design overlay district provides guidelines and standards intended to promote and enhance the identity of the area and create a sense of place the planning and zoning commission generated these goals in the spring of 2006 specifically the goals for overlay district are 1to promote storefront shopping center or industrial building design that enhances the physical appearance of the corridor and establishes an identity distinguishing it from development found elsewhere on interstate 80 and in the state  2to promote the application of these design guidelines while still allowing companies to maintain their own identity and ability to be easily recognized by the general public  and 3to promote individual site planning to ensure that the internal and external vehicular and pedestrian circulation pattern in the district is safe and easy to navigate bdesign principles the prairie fire design overlay district is based upon the following set of principles 1consistency the city hopes that development in the district will be diverse and feature a mixture of development types such as shopping centers hotels restaurants recreational facilities and museums design of all these facilities is guided by the individual business use and site constraints within that context development within the district should maintain a consistency and compatibility between the different uses selection of exterior surface materials landscape materials and sign programs 2safety public safety is critical to the success of commercially zoned districts public safety not only refers to safety from criminal activity but also safety for automobile and pedestrian traffic this can be addressed planning considerations such as lighting landscaping internal sidewalks and bikewalking trails 3simplicity simplicity refers to the reduction of visual clutter and the implementation of an architecturalsignsite design that fits into the existing and future development of the whole district 4organically organically refers to the style of development the city hopes to see occur within the district the prairie is the source of inspiration for the district and the city wants building and landscape designs to reflect that natural environment highly manicured plantings and shrubs as shown in image 2 would not likely fit into this natural development style in addition to reflecting this natural environment landscaping erosion controls and layouts should also work to protect and restore the prairie 2011    administration ageneral all projects within this district will be reviewed for compliance with the design guidelines before approval of a development plan and issuance of a building or sign permit all development projects within the prairie fire design overly district are subject to administrative approval within 15 working days after submittal of the application for development plan approval brequired submittal materials the following elements are required when submitting a development plan in the prairie fire design overlay district for administrative approval in addition to the requirements of ch 155 of this code of ordinances the following items should also be submitted as part of the development plan 1architectural drawings of buildings and structures that include photographs or catalog cuts of building materials when available  2copy of the sign program for the subdivision that indicates location of the highrise signage  3detailed landscaping plan  4design details of signage  5design details of lighting fixtures  and 6design detail of fences and freestanding walls cmaintenance 1design guidelines are only one part of the equation for producing and keeping a highquality development area over time it is the responsibility of the individual properties to maintain their site in a presentable manner 2the following guidelines should be followed in addition to the guidelines found in ch 94 of this code of ordinances alandscaping shall be maintained appropriately dead plant material shall be removed and replaced with the same or similar type

the submittal of the plan the applicant shall have the privilege of requesting planning and zoning commission and city council review and action it is the responsibility of the applicant to file a written appeal with the city planner no later than ten working days after the city planners decision to ensure a planning and zoning commission and city council hearing date review and action 2011

promote highquality development and serve as an extension of the zoning subdivision and site plan ordinances the city has established consistency between these ordinances and this design overlay district however in some instances these guidelines are more restrictive than the zoning subdivision or site plan ordinances whenever the case the most restrictive regulations shall apply bas noted earlier the city encourages businesses to pursue their individual identities within these guidelines because todays market has such a vast selection of building materials the city does not wish to advocate the use of any one particular material however the city does wish to advocate the use of materials that are going to produce highquality construction and landscaping that will enhance the look and feel of the district throughout the following guidelines and standards pictures and sketches are used to convey the expectation in quality feel and appearance 2011    exterior finish and

operated by publicly regulated utilities or uses traditionally affected by public interest  2uses entirely private in character which because of their peculiar locational need the nature of the
