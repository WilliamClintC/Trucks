connection to the citys water distribution system as established under of this the citys publicly owned treatment works sewer system as established under of this are hereby established for the following purposes to recover the cost of construction reconstruction maintenance repair and operation of those systems  to comply with the federal and state acts and regulations applicable to those systems  to provide for the payment of principal of and interest on any bonds authorized to be issued as and when the same become due and payable and to create a bond and interest redemption fund therefor  to provide a fund for reasonable and necessary improvements to the systems  and to provide for such other funds as are necessary to meet contractual obligations of the issuer such charges rates and fees shall be made in accordance with the purposes herein described as well as the following a all premises connected directly or indirectly to the water distribution system andor the sewer system except as hereinafter provided shall be charged as provided by this shall make payments to the city in the amounts provided in of this b the charges rates and fees for water service by the water distribution system and sewer service by the sewer system are established herein to adequately provide for bond requirements and to ensure that those systems do not operate at a deficit c each systems staff or other parties as designated by the city shall periodically review the charges rates fees rules and regulations of their respective systems which reviews shall be completed not less than one 1 time per fiscal year results of the reviews for each system shall be reported to the city commission with recommendations for any adjustments d the charges rates and fees shall be set so as to recover costs from the users of each system in reasonable proportion to the cost of serving those users 19a2 proportionality fairness and benefits of charges rates and fees the city commission has previously found and further currently reaffirms that the fairest and most reasonable method of providing for the operation maintenance repair replacement and improvement of the water distribution system and the sewer system is to charge each user based in all cases on amount of use for the costs of i retiring debt secured by the net revenues of those systems issued to pay for improvements and replacements to the systems  ii ongoing repair replacement and improvement and budgeted as part of the annual costs of the systems  and iii operation administration and maintenance costs of the systems the city has investigated several methods of apportioning the costs of the water service provided by the water distribution system and the costs of the sewage disposal service provided by the sewer system based on its investigation and on the advice of its engineers the city commission has previously found and currently reaffirms that to ensure the stability and viability of those systems for the benefit of its users a fair and accurate way to apportion the costs of operation maintenance replacement and improvement of the systems is to charge each user i a capital connection charge for water service and a capital connection charge for sewer service when a users property is first connected to each of those systems  ii a basic water rate which includes a fixed minimum bimonthly charge plus a commodity charge for the use of water and a basic sewer rate which includes a fixed minimum bimonthly charge plus a commodity charge for the use of sewer  and iii a high volume service charge for high volume users of each system the city commission has previously found and currently reaffirms that the rates and charges currently in effect accurately apportion the fixed and variable costs of the systems among the users of each system and that the basic water rates basic sewer rates and the highvo l u me service charges each provide actual benefits to such users in the form of ready access to water service and sewer service that would be unavailable if such charges were not charged the city commission has previously found and currently reaffirms that the declining block rates set forth in the basic water rates and the basic sewer rates fairly and proportionally allocate the fixed and variable costs of the respective systems among all users of the systems and that the use of such block rates is supported not only by the citys engineers but also by leading experts in utility service rate setting methodology in addition to the findings set forth above the city commission has previously found and currently reaffirms that the capital connection charges for the water distribution system and for the sewer system reflect the proportional capital costs of those systems previously paid by the city and the systems attributable to each new user of the systems and that the opportunity to connect to the systems provides actual benefits to each new user equal to or greater than the amount of such charges furthermore the city commission has previously found and currently reaffirms that the charges imposed by the systems are sufficient to meet the shortterm capital improvement needs of each system as set forth the shortterm capital improvement plan proposed by the city manager 19a3 basic water rates the bimonthly charges for water service furnished by the citys water distribution system as measured by a water meter installed in each premises shall be as provided in of this basic sewer rates the bimonthly charges for sewer service furnished by the

multiple violations for each day on which such a violation occurs or continues d each violation of a monthly average limit or of some other average limit period for a single pollutant or sampling parameter shall constitute a separate violation for each day of the month or other stated period during which the violation occurred regardless of the number of days on which samples were actually taken for example in a month with 31 days a violation of the monthly average limit for that month constitutes 31 violations for each pollutant parameter for which the monthly average limit was exceeded during the month e except with regard to violations of average limits as provided by d a violation will be deemed to have continued to occur each day beginning with the first day the violation occurred to the day the user is able to demonstrate sampling results that the violation is no longer occurring f if for any period a user has violated both a daily maximum limit and an average limit for a particular pollutant parameter then the total number of violations is the sum of the days on which the daily maximum limit was violated plus the number of days in the averaging period g if a user permit regulates more than one outfall each outfall shall be considered separately in computing the number of violations as provided by this if a user is discharging a waste stream that is required to be monitored and analyzed under continuous monitoring procedures then all of the following shall apply 1 if at any time during a daily 24hour period the continuous monitoring shows that the monitored parameter exceeded the instantaneous minimum instantaneous maximum or daily maximum limit for that parameter then a violation has occurred 2 if during a daily 24hour period under

during a daily 24hour period under continuous monitoring the monitored parameter exceeds the instantaneous minimum instantaneous maximum or daily limit into the next daily 24hour period ie the exceedance occurs both before and after midnight then the exceedance will be considered a separate violation on both days 4 if during a daily 24hour period under continuous monitoring the monitored parameter exceeds instantaneous minimum instantaneous maximum or the daily limit for more than 66% of the 24hour as determined in minutes of the day then the user will be considered to be in significant noncompliance i one 1 violation occurs on each day that a report is late  and each day after an action required to be completed is not completed 19 nuisance a violation of this or of any
