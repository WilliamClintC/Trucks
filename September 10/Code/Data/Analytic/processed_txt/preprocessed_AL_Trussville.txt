 1 2 adopted feb 10 1998 general a detention devices developments which produce an increase in the amount of stormwater runoff may be required to construct stormwater detention ponds or other approved types of detention devices b plans when required the developer shall submit detailed engineering plans to the director of engineering and inspections including historical runoff developed runoff detention pond details method of discharge and other information as required for review the developer shall also include a description of the method of maintenance for the detention pond after the development is completed c minimum requirements for stormwater detention and design criteria among the consequences of growth and development two are of great relevance to stormwater management i increased runoff created by the change of the nature and properties of the surface of the ground and ii velocity of discharge of this increased runoff the natural condition of the land before development is in relative balance with the natural capacity of the receiving streams the undeveloped conditions provide greater permeability and longer time of concentration by modification of the surface from the irregular pervious and with vegetation the areas more changed to more impervious more effectively drained and in most cases denuded of vegetation it is the intent of this section to alert the developers to possible harmful effects from any land development project on properties downstream and to provide a guideline for evaluation and control of the elements related to stormwater which affect the welfare and safety of the citizens of the city in order to provide some control of these possible harmful elements of development and reduce economic losses due to erosion and flooding the criteria of differential runoff and stormwater detention are hereby established the terms of this design criterion shall become effective for all projects under direct jurisdiction of the

loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately
