within 24 hours d prohibition of bypass 1 bypass is prohibited and the director may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless a the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the industrial user submitted notices as required under this section 2 the director may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection d1 of this section and the industrial user complies with

stormwater discharges associated with construction activity purpose a during the construction process soil becomes the most vulnerable to erosion by wind and water this eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and silting the aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of waterways in addition clearing and grading during construction causes the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat b as a result the purpose of the local regulations contained in this subdivision is to safeguard persons protect property prevent damage to the environment protect water quality and promote the public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction use and maintenance of any development or other land disturbing activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth or land in the city and to provide a healthy living environment for citizens of the city of baytown  6 61109 applicability this subdivision applies to all premises that have stormwater discharges associated with construction activity construction activities disturbing less than one acre that are not part of a larger common plan of development are not required to submit an noi or other documentation to the state but must submit a

102496    1 4915 statutory authorization in vtca water the state legislature has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore in response thereto the city has adopted this article 21   82285   1 52207   2 6707 findings of fact a the special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage 22   82285 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area 23   82285 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in the times of flood or that cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 24   82285 lands to
