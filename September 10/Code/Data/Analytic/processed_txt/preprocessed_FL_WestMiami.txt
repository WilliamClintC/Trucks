order will not result in a degradation of the adopted levels of service for specified public facilities and services the symcon also includes a monitoring system for determination of the availability of adequate capacity of public facilities and services to meet the adopted level of service standards 2 adopted levels of service shall not be degraded a general rule all applications for development orders shall demonstrate that the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service in the city an application for a development permit shall demonstrate that the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service if there exists no development order under which the permit is sought and no development order is required prior to the issuance of the permit eg a residence on a parcel of unplatted land the latest point at which concurrency is determined is the final development order if no development is required the latest point to determine concurrency is the first development permit on a site b exception notwithstanding the foregoing the prescribed levels of service may be degraded during the actual construction of new facilities if upon completion of the new facilities the prescribed levels of service will be met 3 determination of availability capacity for the purpose of these regulations the available capacity of a facility shall be determined by a adding together 1 the total capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service  and 2 the total capacity of new facilities if any that will become available on or before the date of occupancy of the development the capacity of new facilities may be counted only if one or more of the following is shown a construction of the new facilities is under way at the time of issuance of the final development order b the new facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for the construction of the facilities or the provision of services at the time of issuance of the final development order c the new facilities are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement an enforceable development agreement may include but is not limited to development agreements pursuant to fla statutes or an agreement or development order pursuant to fla statutes such facilities shall be consistent with the capital improvements element of the city comprehensive plan the agreement must guarantee that the necessary facilities and services will be in place when the impacts of the development occur b subtracting from that number the sum of 1 the demand for the service or facility created by existing development as documented in the city comprehensive plan  and 2 the demand for the service or facility created by the anticipated completion of other approved developments redevelopment or other development activity c action upon failure to show available capacity where available capacity cannot be shown the following methods may be used to maintain adopted level of service 1 the project owner or developer may provide the necessary improvements to maintain level of service in such case the application shall include appropriate plans for improvements documentation that such improvements are designed to provide the capacity necessary to achieve or maintain the level of service and recordable instruments guaranteeing the construction consistent with calculations of capacity above 2 the proposed project may be altered such that projected level of service is no less than the adopted level of service 3 burden of showing compliance on developer the burden of showing compliance with these levels of service requirements shall be upon the developer in order to be approvable applications for development approval shall provide sufficient information showing compliance with these standards 4 initial determination of concurrency the initial determination of concurrency occurs during the review of the preliminary development plan and shall include
