standards  general guidelines the following guidelines provide specific recommendations for how trails should be routed andor constructed to reduce maintenance and environmental impacts and should be followed in the construction of trails a trails should be located and constructed in such a manner as to minimize maintenance and maximize access b trails should follow natural contours where possible and respect surrounding landforms for example trails crossing steep sites should flow with the landform c drainage features such as water bars should be constructed where appropriate to reduce erosion d trail slopes should match expected user volumes and types refer to aashto guide for the development of bicycle facilities for further guidance   location bonding phasing and liability for trails a location where feasible trails should be separated from vehicle traffic b bonding for trail improvements where trails are required as part of a development project a security or bond will be posted for the full cost of the trail improvements prior to plat recording or the trail shall be installed prior to the recording of the plat in accordance with section  of this title c phasing of trail improvements when trails are part of a phased project the phasing of various trail segments will follow a logical sequence for trail users some trail construction may be required entire project to provide completed trail connections at an early phase in the project d trail rights of way and easements all trails that are open to the public should be located on publicly dedicated property or dedicated easements for such purposes there are a variety of mechanisms for this to occur public street rights of way and dedicated easements are the most common and acceptable forms of access rights the trails map provides recommended right of way widths for the various trail types e trail easement liability in cases where public easements are dedicated or lease agreements are negotiated for public use with private landowners the jurisdiction should assume general liability responsibility in the same manner as assumed for streets and other public areas eff 4132014  recommendations for environmentally sensitive sites a special location or construction methods may be necessary to reduce impacts and minimize disturbance in environmentally sensitive areas examples of visually or environmentally sensitive sites include flood zones highly  sterling codifiers inc  280571 visible hillsides significant vegetation areas highly erodible soils unstable slopes and ridgelines b techniques such as site specific trail routing erosion control measures site specific adjustment of construction standards and site specific construction practices should be implemented to minimize environmental visual or construction impacts construction methods that should reduce impacts include installing retaining walls to reduce cut and fill slopes on a visually prominent hillside hand construction of the trail stabilizing a mine hazard that is located within or adjacent to a trail corridor or installing a tree well around a significant tree to be preserved c each environmentally sensitive site is unique specific trail proposals locations need to be considered on a case by case basis   guidelines for sensitive sites a construction practices for sensitive sites disturbance fencing limits should be implemented to minimize construction impacts construction limits should be as small as practical to construct the trail significant vegetation root zones should be considered when locating the trail and establishing construction limits b erosion control methods should be employed to protect areas adjacent to the trail from impacts both during and after construction see drainage planning and slope management guidelines sections c indigenous materials indigenous construction materials should be used for retaining walls bridges and barriers wherever possible d existing vegetation existing significant vegetation should be preserved wherever possible trees riparian vegetation scrub oak and rare plants are considered significant root zones as well as aboveground vegetation require protection when preserving plants in general the area within the drip line of trees especially on the down slope side of the vegetation is sensitive to disturbance if root zones are impacted or grades are changed significantly temporary irrigation may be necessary e revegetation native andor selfsustaining plant materials should be used for revegetation of all disturbed areas where trails pass or nonirrigated sites revegetation can be used to provide screening construction techniques to preserve vegetation and trail routing techniques should be used to minimize visual intrusion f natural considerations where significant wildlife or other natural features exist special trail routing construction methods and trail use should be considered g visually sensitive areas locations that are visually sensitive such as tallus slopes may require reduced cut and fill slopes hand construction and low retaining walls to minimize site disturbance and visual intrusion h environmentally hazardous areas where environmental hazards are present special trail construction techniques or locations should be used to mitigate the hazard hazardous areas can be abandoned mine sites where mine tailings should be stabilized top soiled and revegetated other hazardous locations such as lightning prone areas rockslide and avalanche areas should either be avoided or be closed seasonally when hazardous conditions are a problem i microclimatic trail use opportunities locate the trails for both summer and winter activities where possible given the terrain and climatic considerations identify snow retention areas for possible cross country ski trails in open areas place trail alignment to take advantage of wind protection and shaded canyon areas   utilities  sterling codifiers inc  281571 the routing of utilities within trail corridors is generally encouraged many trail managers have allowed colocation of utilities in consideration for appropriate fee payments by the utility company locations that are visually or environmentally sensitive may restrict or preclude sharing utilities with trails the following guidelines for placement site disturbance and access should be followed a placement utility lines that run parallel to the trail should be placed under the trail bed where possible to minimize site disturbance utility lines that are perpendicular to the trail and lateral lines should be located to minimize site disturbance and removal of significant vegetation physical obstructions such as utility pedestals transformers and the like should be located out of the clear zone so they are not hazards to trail users access points which are not a physical obstruction such as manhole covers should be located flush with the trail surface and where they do not pose a hazard to trail users b site disturbance construction of utility lines within naturally vegetated areas should minimize site disturbance wherever possible all disturbances should be revegetated according to the requirements for trail construction bonding for this work should be required c utility access access for utility maintenance vehicles will be evaluated on a case by case basis and provided for as part of the trail construction visually or environmentally sensitive sites may preclude full access to trailutility corridors   vertical clearance guidelines a ten foot 10 vertical clearance from the trail surface is recommended the vertical clearance to obstructions will be a minimum of eight feet 8 across the clear width of the path  sterling codifiers inc  282571   trail surfacing guidelines asphalt concrete and base specifications will meet those set forth in this document the six foot 6 crushed rock trail surfaces may be substituted

subgrade should be placed under the dirt surface in areas with a high water table or with poor drainage conditions if a wood or other edging material is used along any of the trail surfaces care will be taken to assure trail surface drainage edging is not recommended along soft surface trails because the soft surface changes over time causing the hard edge to impede drainage weed or root barriers also may be necessary  sterling codifiers inc  283571   drainage planning careful study of topography adjacent to the trail may yield insight to maximize protection of the trail while minimizing trail structures general drainage should be studied at fifty 50 stations with provisions made to protect the trail a swells and culverts drainage swells or culverts should be installed on trails at locations where the normal cross slope will not allow for adequate drainage drainage swells are not allowed on paved trails drains are best located at low points or bends in the trail along existing natural drainageways wherever water is concentrated into new locations or in heavier concentrations erosion protection needs to be evaluated and installed if necessary native stone is the preferred material  sterling codifiers inc  284571 b drainage grates drainage inlet grates on bikeways will have openings narrow enough and short enough to assure bicycle tires will not drop into the grates eg reticular type regardless of the direction of bicycle travel c bicycle safe drainage grates drainage grates should be installed where necessary to allow drainage and safe passage for bicycles  sterling codifiers inc  285571 d water bar water bars will likely need to be installed at regular intervals on soft surface trails that are steeper than a five percent 5% gradient for more than five 5 vertical feet rubber water bars should be used since they are the safest for multiple use trails also construction is more economical faster and easier than other construction methods  sterling codifiers inc  286571   slope management guidelines when sloped areas are disturbed the area needs to be stabilized and revegetated as part of the trail construction process to prevent subsequent soil erosion and frequent maintenance problems  a permanent slope stabilization 1 retaining walls permanent slope stabilization includes native stacked rock or wood retaining walls rock filled gabions wire baskets wattling planting or placing plant materials and slope serration where necessary for safety retaining walls should be installed to prevent erosion of cut or fill slopes to reduce cut and fill slopes or to minimize disturbance on environmentally or aesthetically sensitive sites retaining walls should be constructed of indigenous or natural materials walls located on visually sensitive sites should be designed to blend with the natural surroundings materials texture color and height all affect the visual prominence of a retaining wall walls exceeding a height of four feet 4 must conform to the requirements set forth in the international building code eff 7122013 following are some guidelines for various techniques all uninterrupted cut or fill slopes will not exceed six 6 vertical feet unless a site specific analysis is performed to justify otherwise some method of permanent slope stabilization should be required for all slopes in excess of two to one  vertical unless a site specific soils analysis is performed to justify otherwise  sterling codifiers inc  287571 2 cut and fill slopes combined cut and fill slopes should not exceed twelve 12 vertical feet and individual cut or fill slopes should not exceed six 6 vertical feet less in environmentally and visually sensitive areas slopes that exceed these parameters should consider low retaining walls or alternate routing of the trail to a more acceptable location cut or fill finish grades should not exceed a two to one  vertical unless a site specific soil analysis is performed to justify the stability of steeper slopes all cut and fill slopes will be stabilized and revegetated as per the revegetation and slope stabilization guidelines 3 existing vegetation protection existing significant vegetation that is to be saved will be protected with temporary fencing along the limits of disturbance trees that are to be saved should not be disturbed within the drip line of  sterling codifiers inc  288571 the tree if possible and the protective limits of disturbance fencing should extend to the drip line where this is not possible all work within the drip line should be done by hand and mechanical equipment should not be allowed within the drip line if filling is necessary above the root zone perforated pipe along the drip line and vertical air wells should be installed if cutting of roots or interception of natural drainage to the root zone is necessary temporary irrigation may be required to compensate for the disturbance 4 temporary runoff management during construction and establishment of revegetation techniques such as temporary erosion control runoff measures and slope stabilization may be necessary techniques such as hydro mulching straw mulch jute matting wood excelsior matting tackifiers straw bales siltation fences matting in drainage channels and stone mulching are examples of temporary runoff management the following treatment guidelines provide some direction for the use of these measures all are temporary measures and are intended to last from one to two 2 years until permanent stabilization techniques are effective 5 wattling bundles of branches are used to both stabilize and revegetate slopes that are nearly stable but continue to erode wattling is only recommended after initial methods have failed and where the unstable areas are minor 6 slope serration small steps or indentations are cut in the slope face and are useful for providing small favorable sites for vegetation establishment this technique should be used only on soils that are fairly cohesive sites that have severe exposure to heat sun or wind and have slopes that are excessively steep benefit most from this method 7 switchbacks switchbacks are expensive to construct but are necessary when steep slopes are encountered when switchbacks are required they should be designed to discourage crosscutting and subsequent erosion locate switchbacks where natural barriers exist installing physical or visual barriers or providing sufficient separation between the switchbacks all help to discourage crosscutting if crosscutting cannot be discouraged or construction then the installation of stairs or relocation of the trail should be considered 8 revegetation revegetation consists of seeding and planting operations seed and plant species and application rates will be submitted and approved with the construction plans in general the revegetation of natural sites will match that of the undisturbed areas in species density and vegetation

necessary for the protection of neighboring properties or the general welfare of the city because of the proximity of a parcel of property to a particular landscape feature such as a cliff or a hillside where there would be no negative impact from a relaxation of such standards  2 where a few uses in an existing zone would be appropriate on a particular parcel of property but the remainder

property owner who leases space for a personal wireless services facility is the only one who receives compensation for the facility even though numerous other property owners in the area are adversely affected by the location of the facility 8 utah grants cities the authority to create or acquire sites to accommodate the erection of telecommunications towers in order to promote the location of telecommunications towers in a manageable area and to protect the aesthetics and environment of the area the law also allows the city to require the owner of any tower to accommodate the

mgd is required to provide wastewater capacity to meet the needs of projected future city development in erus to the year 2011 the existing need is anticipated to be funded by the city using user fees while the projected future need is anticipated to be funded by user fees and a sewer impact fee imposed and expended by the city in accordance with the mapleton city wastewater capital facilities plan and this title impact fees procedures b the mapleton city sewer impact fee is designed to impose the pro rata cost of wastewater facilities on new residential and nonresidential development based on the proportionate share of the costs attributable to new development and based on the adopted los standard of three hundred fifty 350 gallons per day per eru the sewer impact fee represents the average cost of providing wastewater facilities to each eru within the city1 the impact fee calculation methodology places on each new development a share of the costs of providing capacity in the
