alternatively as approved the city as a result of an engineering report prepared by a qualified professional engineer licensed to perform such professional engineering services in the state of texas which demonstrates that the number of lues of service for the new development will be different than those indicated by the size of the water meter c if the city determines that the water pressure in the citys transmission main is significantly higher or lower than standard pressure such that the size of the water meter is not indicative of actual service demand the city may adjust the number of lues based on a smaller or larger sized meter which more accurately reflects the flow rate and the system pressure conditions d if a fire demand meter tap is purchased for a property the meter size utilized to calculate the number of lues shall be the dimension of the portion of the fire demand meter which reflects the meter size which would provide only domestic service to the property said reduced meter size shall then be utilized to calculate the number of lues 1 the meter types used to calculate the number of lues shall be either simple or compound meters 2 if the fire protection capacity of the fire demand meter is routinely utilized for domestic purposes as evidenced by the registration of consumption recorded on the citys meterreading and billing systems the thenowner of

shall acknowledge the right of the city to assess such fees to subsequent owners of the property said covenant shall be executed prior to the purchase of the fire demand meter and shall be filed in the deed records of the county 4 no fees shall be collected for the purchase of taps which shall be utilized to provide only fire protection capacity e upon wastewater tap purchase for lots for which no water meter has been purchased service units shall be established by a professional engineer licensed in the state of texas shall be reviewed by the city and shall be presented to the city

texas local government its successors 09 22111 impact fees per service unit a the maximum impact fee per service unit for each service area shall be computed by dividing the growthrelated capital construction cost of service in the service area identified in the capital improvements plan for that category of capital improvements by the total number of projected service units anticipated within the service area which are necessitated by and attributable to new development based on the land use assumptions for that service area and adjusted by subtracting credits in the form of future rate or tax contributions to water andor wastewater cip funding maximum impact fees per service unit for each service area shall be established by category of capital improvements and shall be set forth in exhibit c b exhibit c may be amended by the city council according to the procedure set forth in of the texas local government its successors c the effective impact fees per service unit may be amended from time to time by the city council amendment to any amount equal to or less than the maximum fees set forth in exhibit c 10 22111 assessment of impact fees a the approval of any subdivision

follows 1 for new development which is submitted for approval pursuant to the citys subdivision regulations following the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived assessment shall be at the time of final subdivision plat approval and shall be the value of the maximum impact fee per service unit then in effect as provided in exhibit c as set forth in section 3410c the city may provide the subdivider with a copy of exhibit c prior to final subdivision plat approval but such shall not constitute assessment within the meaning of this chapter 2 for new development which occurs or is proposed to occur without platting assessment shall be upon the issuance of a building permit and shall be the value of the maximum impact fee per service unit set forth in exhibit c 3 fees shall not be assessed to property which has previously purchased taps for the property and which desires to exchange those purchased taps for taps which will reflect an equivalent number of lues as determined under section 349 if the exchange of said taps will result in an increase in the number of lues the purchaser shall be assessed the maximum impact fee in effect at the time of tap exchange based on the additional lues required 4 because fire protection is of critical concern to the community as a whole water demand related solely to fire protection is not subject to collection of an impact fee however if the fire protection capacity of the fire demand meter is routinely utilized for domestic purposes as evidenced by the registration of consumption recorded on the citys meterreading and billing systems the current owner of the property shall be assessed the impact fees currently in effect at the time such conversion is established by the city for the fire protection capacity which has been converted to domestic capacity by its routine usage as domestic capacity c following assessment of the impact fees pursuant to subsection b of this section no additional impact fees or increases thereof shall be assessed against that development unless the number of service units increases as set forth under section 349 d following the lapse or expiration of approval for a plat a new assessment must be performed at the time a new application for such development is filed 11 22111 calculation of impact fees a following the request for new development as provided in section 3411 the city shall compute maximum impact fees due for the new development in the following manner 1 the total service units for the new development shall be multiplied by the appropriate

for the development either at or before the time of plat recordation the applicant shall file a petition for offsets with the city on a form provided for such purpose the contents of the petition shall be established by administrative guidelines the city must provide the applicant in writing with a decision on the offset request including the reasons for the decision the decision shall specify the maximum value of the offset which may be applied against an impact fee which value and the date of the determination shall be associated with the plat for the new development d the available offset associated with the plat shall be applied against an impact fee in the following manner 1 such offset shall be prorated equally among all service units as calculated in section 349 and remain applicable to such service units to be applied at time of filing and acceptance of an application for a building permit against impact fees due 2 if the total number of service units used by the city in the original offset calculation described in 1 is eventually exceeded by the number of total service units realized by the actual development the city may at its sole discretion collect the full impact fee exclusive of any associated offset for the excess service units 3 at its sole discretion the city may authorize alternative offset agreements upon petition by the owner in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the city 14 22111 establishment of accounts and records a the city shall establish separate interestbearing accounts in a bank authorized to receive deposits of city funds

contract amendment that service providers have such policies and procedures in place  and 2 require by contract or contract amendment that service providers review the utilitys program and report any red flags to the program administrator d specific program elements and confidentiality for the effectiveness of identity theft prevention programs the red flag rule envisions a degree of confidentiality regarding the utilitys specific practices relating to identity theft detection prevention and mitigation therefore under this program knowledge of such specific practices are to be limited to the identity theft committee and those employees who need to know them for purposes of preventing identity theft because this program is to be adopted by a public body and thus publicly available it would be counterproductive to list these specific practices here therefore only the programs general red flag detection implementation and prevention practices are listed in this document
