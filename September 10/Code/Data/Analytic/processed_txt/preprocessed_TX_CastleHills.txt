generated by the development table 1 shows the anticipated boundary of a tia as determined by the number of trips generated by the development using engineering judgment the city reserves the right to adjust the boundary area based on characteristics of the development and the surrounding roadway network and therefore may include intersections outside the boundary areas identified in table 1 all

major unsignalized intersections typically occur when a local roadway with connectivity to multiple other local roadways serving a larger area intersect a collector or arterial roadway   trip generation the number of site specific trips generated by the proposed development shall be determined using the methodologies within the latest version of the ite trip generation manual and the ite

capacity analysis are the current year opening year of the development and five years after the opening year of the development each analysis year should include both the nobuild condition and build condition d the nobuild condition is defined as the traffic volumes and operations anticipated to occur without the developments site traffic the build condition incorporates site specific traffic anticipated to be generated by the proposed development into the nobuild conditions the capacity analysis shall be completed using the latest version of the software programs synchro ptv vistro or an approved alternative e a growth rate must be determined and applied to existing traffic volumes to develop future years traffic volumes the adjusted volumes should to be used in conducting the nobuild

level of service los and delay values at the signalized intersections at unsignalized intersections the stop controlled approachs los and delay values should be shown g a queuing analysis at the site driveways and study intersections should be included within the tia the purpose of the queuing analysis is to determine if the queue is anticipated to intrude or spillback into adjacent the 95th percentile queue length should be utilized to determine if spillback is anticipated to occur h the proposed driveways must follow the citys spacing requirements the tia should confirm that these requirements are met and a sight distance analysis should be completed for all proposed driveways if required the sight distance analysis shall be based on the latest version of a policy on geometric design of highways and streets by the american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto i if required a roadway capacity analysis should be completed for roadways within the

measures and roughly proportionate determination a mitigation measures shall be recommended if adverse impact to the surrounding roadway network is anticipated an adverse impact occurs when the los is anticipated to fall below los c if the nobuild conditions los is d e or f the delay value must not increase by more than ten percent if the delay value increases by more than ten percent mitigation measures shall be recommended the mitigation measures shall improve the level of service to a similar los as the nobuild conditions ie los c or within ten percent of the delay value traffic signal retiming is not considered an acceptable mitigation measure unless required for geometric changes to an intersection or as approved by the city b in some circumstances an intersection is builtout an intersection is typically considered builtout when the number of is consistent with the ultimate configuration of the roadway and include dual left turn lanes and a dedicated right turn lanes on all approaches if an intersection is considered builtout mitigation measures are not feasible the city will determine if the mitigation measures are feasible or not if no mitigation measures are feasible to improve the level of service to a similar los as the nobuild conditions this information should be stated within the tia c a roughly proportionate determination must be completed according to the city of castle hills standards and methodology which shall follow the standards and methodology selected by the city staff andor engineer and which may be the standards and methodology for the city of san antonio a roughly proportionate determination is to establish if the proposed mitigation measures are reasonable and appropriate for the development   submittal and review a all tias shall be

editors note adopted  repealed the former flood damage prevention ordinance of the city uncodified adopted aug 10 201 and enacted new provisions as herein set out article i  in general statutory authorization the legislature of the state of texas has in the flood control insurance act texas water delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council of the city of castle hills texas does ordain as follows  att art i  a 482014  findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of castle hills texas are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  att art i  b 482014  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area  att art i  c 482014  methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards
