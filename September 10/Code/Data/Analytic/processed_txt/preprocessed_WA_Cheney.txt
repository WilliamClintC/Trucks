staff of book publishing company under the direction of the city attorney the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement

section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the

percent of the park development costs shall be covered by park impact fees 2 park impact fee per person 80 percent of the costs of a typical five acre parkestimated six year population increase projections   per person fee $56303400988   $57000 per person 3 cost per person  person per household   park impact fee per household per unit average occupancy fee 01 bedroom apartment or duplex 10 per dwelling unit $57000 2 bedroom apartment or duplex 20 per dwelling unit $114000 3+ bedroom apartment or duplex 26 per dwelling unit $148200 singlefamily residential 26 per dwelling unit $148200 h impact fee allocation the city shall provide a balance between impact and other sources of public funds to meet its capital project needs revenues from property taxes user fees sales tax real estate excise taxes grants and other revenue sources will be used to pay the proportionate share of the growth generated capital facilities costs for the purpose of calculating park impact fees 80 percent of the cost is anticipated to be generated by the collection of impact fees the remaining 20 percent is expected to originate from city county or state sources thus the mitigation assessment reflects a 20 percent discount from the actual acquisition costs  3242009   independent fee calculations if a developer elects not to have the impact fee determined pursuant to section  then 1 the developer

boundaries that are shown crossing lots are usually based on a topographic feature or a set measurement from a property line or topographic feature such as the top of slope or stream bank or middle of a stream when zone boundaries are shown crossing properties with no clear indication of the basis for the line exact distances are to be determined by scaling the distances from the official zoning map using the center of the zoning line b calculating slope from a topographic map   4222014   measuring height height of buildings is measured from the vertical distance from the average grade to the

average a front yard setback  2 setbacks that abut the site  only the setbacks on the lots that abut each side of the site and are on the same street may be used setbacks across the street or along a different street may not be used  and 3 setbacks and lot orientation  when one abutting lot is vacant or if the lot is a corner lot then the average is of the setback of the nonvacant lot and the required setback for the zone  4222014   calculating density the following describes how net density is calculated with certain examples 1 net densities are calculated by averaging lots sizes over an entire development individual lots may vary in size provided they do not exceed the maximum lot area 2 lot calculation if no street is created example in the r1 zone square footage of site  maximum density   maximum number of lots 20000 square feet  7000 square feet   285 lots or 3 lots when rounded up 3 lot calculation if a street is created example in the r1 zone assume a 15 percent loss when a street is created square footage of site x 085  maximum density   maximum number of lots 43560 square feet x 085  7000 square feet   528 lots or 5 lots when rounded down 4 lot calculation if there is a critical area example in the calr zone assume a three acre site with a 20000 square foot wetland and buffer square feet of the site including wetland  max density   maximum number of lots 130680 square feet  10000 square feet   1306 lots or 13 lots when rounded down  4222014   measuring tree diameter a existing trees  existing trees are measured at a height of 4 12 feet above the ground trees on slopes are measured from the ground level on the lower side of the tree if the tree splits into multiple trunks below four and onehalf feet the trunk is measured at its most narrow point below the split b new trees  new trees are measured in caliper inch which is the diameter of the trunk six inches above the ground for up to and including four inches caliper size and 12 inches above the ground for larger trees c tree diameter  tree diameter is measured by taking the circumference of the tree at the height described in items a and b above and dividing the result by 314  4222014 chapter 2112

wetland type  or 2 are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands  or 3 are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime  or 4 provide a high level of functions we cannot afford the risk of any degradation to these wetlands because their functions and values are too difficult to replace generally these wetlands are not common and make up a small percentage of the wetlands in the region scores 2227 b category ii category ii wetlands are difficult though not impossible to replace and provide high levels of some functions these wetlands occur more commonly than category i wetlands but still need a relatively high level of protection scores 1921 c category iii category iii wetlands are wetlands with a moderate level of functions and can often be adequately replaced with a wellplanned mitigation project wetlands scoring between 1618 points generally have been disturbed in some ways and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than category ii wetlands d category iv category iv wetlands have the lowest level of functions scores less than 16 points and are often heavily disturbed these are wetlands that we should be able to replace and in some cases be able to improve however experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case these wetlands may provide some important functions and also need to be protected 2 date of wetland rating wetland rating categories shall be applied to projects which are submitted on or after the date of

mitigation proposal is ecologically preferable when considering offsite mitigation preference should be given to using alternative mitigation such as a mitigation bank an inlieufee program or advance mitigation a there are no reasonable opportunities on site or within the subdrainage basin eg onsite options would require elimination of highfunctioning upland habitat or opportunities on site or within the subdrainage basin do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts considerations should include anticipated replacement ratios for wetland mitigation buffer conditions and proposed widths available water to maintain anticipated hydrogeomorphic classes of wetlands when restored proposed flood storage capacity and potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife impacts such as connectivity  b onsite mitigation would require elimination of highquality upland habitat c offsite mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the altered wetland d offsite locations shall be in the same subdrainage basin unless i established watershed goals for water quality flood storage or conveyance habitat or other wetland functions have been established by the city and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site  or ii credits from a statecertified wetland mitigation bank are used as compensation and the use of credits is consistent with the terms of the certified bank instrument  iii fees are paid to an approved inlieu fee program to compensate for the impacts e the design for the compensatory mitigation project needs to be appropriate for its location ie position in the landscape therefore compensatory mitigation should not result in the creation restoration or enhancement of an atypical wetland 6 credits credits from a wetland mitigation bank may be approved for use as compensation for unavoidable impacts to
