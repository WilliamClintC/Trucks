nearest edge of the driveway where it intersects with the rightofway line spacing between driveways is measured from the nearest edge of each driveway where intersecting with the street rightofway existing driveways that do not meet the above standards may be retained but the elimination of unnecessary access points is strongly encouraged notwithstanding the above standards any lot of record shall be entitled to a minimum of one driveway 3 in recognition of the unique circumstances of some parcels of land the planning board shall be permitted to vary the standards set forth in 1 above the planning board may approve projects that do not conform strictly to the access standards above provided that a finding is made by the planning board that safe and adequate access can be achieved any deviation from the standards in 1 above can only be considered after first receiving a written recommendation from the city engineer 4 when a nonresidential zoned parcel straddles a residential zone nonresidential traffic shall be prohibited from exiting into or entering from the residential zone unless there is no other viable option i incentives for reducing the number of driveways in the b3 b4 b5 i2 and i4 districts 1 in addition to limiting the number and location of driveways the city of dover encourages shared driveways for adjacent parcels the elimination of existing driveways and the construction of fewer driveways than permitted in  15314h by limiting access points the number of points where turning vehicles and conflict is reduced to provide incentives for shared driveways in the b3 b4 b5 i2 and i4 districts an incentive system has been developed 2 an applicant may increase the maximum lot coverage permitted in the table of dimensional regulations referenced in zoning for the b3 b4 b5 i2 and i4 districts by electing to use one or more of the provisions listed below the planning board shall decide if the applicant complies with the provisions of the incentive system an applicant may utilize one or more of the following voluntary provisions a provide a shared driveway to be the sole access to the subject parcel and one or more adjacent parcels to qualify for this incentive the applicant shall provide appropriate easements to ensure that the shared driveway will remain in existence and will be adequately maintained b for parcels with existing driveways reduce either the number of separate driveways or the total width of the existing driveways as measured at the rightofway line by at least 50% or reduce the number of driveways to one driveway of not more than 32 feet in width c reduce the total number of driveways permitted or increase the spacing between driveways by 25% over the standards set in  15314h1 herein or increase the spacing between driveways and public street intersections by 25% over the standards set in  15314h1 herein 3 if the planning board finds that an applicant has complied with one or more of the voluntary provisions the following incentives shall be granted for each of the provisions achieved the planning board shall permit an additional 5% of lot coverage building footprint above the maximum permitted in the table of dimensional regulations referenced in zoning eg the maximum lot coverage building footprint in the i4 district could be increased from 33% to 38% if one provision was achieved j interconnections between parcels 1 in order to reduce the number of vehicles entering and exiting arterial and collector roads the provision of interconnecting driveways is required whenever feasible these interconnecting driveways or service roads are provided to allow customers and employees to move from site to site without repeatedly using city streets 2 in the b3 b4 b5 i2 and i4 districts an applicant shall integrate an interconnecting driveway into the overall traffic and pedestrian circulation of the subject site interconnecting driveways shall be provided to access abutting parcels if an adjacent parcels is vacant the applicant shall grant an easement for future access the easements shall be written to ensure that the interconnections will remain open and will be adequately maintained the crossconnections shall be located to encourage internal traffic between abutting properties and shall be adequately marked with directional signs 3 in recognition of the unique circumstances of some parcels of land the planning board shall be permitted to vary the standards set forth in 2 above the planning board may approve projects that do not conform strictly to the interconnection standards above provided that a finding is made by the planning board that the unique circumstances of the parcel make compliance unreasonable any deviation from the standards in 2 above can only be considered after first receiving a written recommendation from the city engineer k location of parking lots 1 buildings should be sited closer to the street and parking areas should be located on the side or rear of lots in an effort to reduce the visual dominance of parking areas improve pedestrian safety in parking lots and increase the visibility of businesses to drivers the following standards are required a for parcels in the b4 district with frontage and driveway access on an arterial or collector road a minimum percentage of the parking spaces required by these regulations or of the number of parking spaces proposed whichever is greater shall be located to the side or rear of the building ie no closer to the front lot line than the building according to the following number of spaces percent of spaces to side or rear 50 to 75 50% 76 to 100 60% number of spaces percent of spaces to side or rear more than 100 70% b for parcels in all other nonresidential districts other than b4 and for parcels in the b4 district where the parking requirement is fewer than 50 spaces the requirements for parking lot location in 1a are optional however if an applicant voluntarily complies with the standards of 1a the applicant shall be entitled to a 25% reduction in the amount of landscaping for the interior of the parking lot required in 2a or a 50% reduction in the paved area application fee 2 in recognition of the unique circumstances of some parcels of land the planning board shall be permitted to vary the standards set forth in 1a above the planning board may approve projects that do not conform strictly to the parking lot location standards above provided that a finding is made by the planning board that the unique circumstances of the parcel make compliance unreasonable l architectural design standards 1 findings the city of dover planning board finds that a our city contains an historic downtown area three major thoroughfare business districts beautiful rural landscape replete with unique natural and cultural resources an excellent architectural tradition a colorful history and much visual appeal b preserving and enhancing these features is integral to maintaining the character and identity of our community c building designs which are indifferent to the traditions of our city and region aggressively seek the attention of passing motorists do not consider the quality of the pedestrian environment or are erected at the lowest possible cost without due concern for aesthetics harm the character of our community depress property values and impair our quality of life d while subjectivity and judgment is invariably part of reviewing architectural designs there are universal principles of good design e wellcrafted design standards can promote building design that is functional economical attractive and harmonious quality development and sustainable economic development are not mutually exclusive  rather they are interdependent 2 purpose a the purpose of the architectural design standards is to  provide for highquality architecture that respects universal design principles enhances the appearance of dover reinforces pedestrian character where appropriate and is sensitive to neighboring buildings the broader setting and natural and cultural resources  protect and enhance the positive visual qualities of dovers downtown residential neighborhoods commercial corridors industrial parks and scenic and rural landscapes  encourage design which is compatible with the traditional character of dover and new england  enhance property values and foster civic pride  minimize potential aesthetic conflicts between residential and nonresidential uses and between singlefamily and multifamily uses b adherence to these standards should not be burdensome and they are not intended to stifle creativity or variety on the contrary the standards will likely encourage more thoughtful approaches to building design there is much flexibility embodied in the guidelines and many ways of meeting the objectives it is hoped that they will serve as useful guidelines for design professionals and applicants seeking to produce quality designs respectful of place and context 3 adoption this section is adopted pursuant to the city of dover master plan and rsa  innovative land use controls and  site plan review regulations 4 applicability a architectural design review is required as part of the site plan review process for all nonresidential structures and for all residential structures where the total number of dwelling units in one development whether in one or more structures exceeds four however in no event would any singlefamily structures or properties be subject to review this includes all new construction building additions and alterations to buildings if those alterations would significantly affect the exterior appearance of the building design review is required only for building elevations and portions of structures that would be visible from a public street or path or from neighboring residential properties all applicable development must conform to these guidelines as reasonably interpreted and applied by the planning board b architectural design review is not conducted for routine repair or maintenance of structures any work on the interior of a building any existing structures for which no exterior alterations are proposed and modifications solely for the purpose of providing safe means of egress or access in order to meet requirements of the building life safety design review is only conducted in instances found within  1534 applicability 5 various sections of the city various sections of the city differ from one another in character and in appropriate treatment the following sections are listed in order generally from the most sensitive to the least sensitive sections a cbd central business district this zone encompasses the downtown areas and is highly sensitive because of the importance and challenge of maintaining a pleasing pedestrian environment this is the central business district which includes the areas along washington street from chestnut street to main street all of main street and a section of central avenue from sixth street to silver street as one travels closer to the core areas traditionally the buildings are taller closer to the sidewalk built of more substantial materials and more elaborate in design and detailing b cwd cochecho waterfront district these areas are not as sensitive as existing neighborhoods in which existing residents could be vulnerable to new development over which they have little control new commercial structures are not being built in traditional neighborhoods  however this zone is adjacent to the existing downtown core and should feel as if it is an extension of the cbd district the architecture of the waterfront areas should encourage the development of marine  history or tourismrelated land uses and activities which take advantage of the peculiar characteristics of the waterfront as well as its central location in dover and it proximity to the historic area c b1 neighborhood business district and o office district these areas are sensitive because some older neighborhoods that are zoned for mixed use have been harmed by incompatible multifamily and nonresidential development these are transitional zones and as such the new nonresidential components should respect the character and nature of the existing residential uses new development should blend in with the traditional character of these neighborhoods in order not to diminish property values and the smallscale pedestrian nature of these areas d b3 thoroughfare business district b4 hotelretail district and b5 highway business district it is important to enhance the quality of commercial development along these corridors such as routes 9 108 4 and 155 all serve as gateways to the city carry high levels of traffic and are the most prominent areas of the city on the other hand an intensive automobile oriented and big boxsmall box character is already established in many areas thus while we seek to enhance the visual experience along these corridors there are generally fewer sensitive resources vulnerable to this type of development amended 1142020 e i1 restricted industrial district i2 rural restricted industrial district and i4 assembly and office district we seek to enhance the quality of our industrial parks such as venture drive and industrial park road however because these are located on deadend streets with almost no incidental traffic and with few vulnerable existing visual resources they are less sensitive 6 general standards an application is considered to meet the design requirements of the architectural design standards if the planning board in its judgment determines that the application overall demonstrates reasonable conformity with the purpose above the general standards that follow and elements of design in the next subsection a recognizing that every property every proposal and every situation is unique the planning board may waive or modify any of the standards herein as it reasonably deems appropriate based upon the individual circumstances of any application no particular architectural style is stipulated and innovative contemporary and distinctive designs are encouraged provided they are respectful of general design principles and context b buildings should be compatible with traditional new england architecture they should be articulated to express an architectural identity and ideally will be handsome and dignified c while the use of a traditional architectural vocabulary gables porticos belt courses etc is desirable designers are encouraged to use this vocabulary in an original manner that reads as contemporary d it is recognized that many national and regional chain businesses seek to build a standard design across the country or region without regard to local conditions however the planning board will evaluate all proposed designs for their compatibility with our own local community character and for conformance with the goals of these guidelines it shall be the obligation of the applicants to develop designs that are compatible with our community character  the city need not make adjustments to accommodate these template designs e use of false or partial mansard roofs unconventionally shaped roofs overly bright colors disproportionately sized building elements crudeness of features or a general plastic feel of the building is not appropriate f buildings should possess an overall integrity architectural details should not give the impression of being tacked on but rather should be integral to the overall design for example use of undersized shutters on a picture window or installation of an elaborate classical portico or cupola on an otherwise clearly utilitarian big box would be discouraged g generally the less visible or prominent a structure or facade is the lower the level of standards will be for example less strict review is in order for a building located a good distance from the road or for one that is partly obscured by another structure h while it cannot be required under these guidelines the reuse of existing structures that have special architectural historical cultural or contextual value is strongly encouraged amended 1142020 i modifications and additions to existing buildings should be harmonious with the character of the existing building when the existing building would reasonably be considered to be in general conformance with the goals of these guidelines j building design should blend with other features of the site signage landscaping lighting fencing outbuildings etc to the extent practical k whenever possible signage on buildings in the cbd district is encouraged to follow the mill motif criteria as set out in  17032o mill motif design criteria of zoning 7 elements of design proposed designs should be harmonious with neighboring structures that have a visual relationship with the subject building in terms of mass width height proportion spacing setback and all of the other elements of design discussed below when those neighboring structures would reasonably be considered to be in general conformance with the goals of these guidelines this is particularly applicable to older buildings located in downtown areas and residential neighborhoods a siting of building  to the extent practical structures should be located and configured in a visually harmonious manner in keeping with the terrain and vegetation and should not impede scenic views  most buildings are oriented parallel or perpendicular to the street this pattern reinforces the streetscape buildings should not be oriented at odd angles to the street unless this is already the prevailing pattern in the area or if it is dictated by strong topographic or site considerations b scale  every effort should be made to provide an appropriate scale to new buildings both in their overall size and in their details  if practical it is preferred that buildings contain at least two stories alternatively a singlestory building should have a relatively steep roof or a high parapet it is required in the cbd zone for buildings to be multistory in order to reinforce the sense of enclosure of the street c proportion buildings and their details should be well proportioned in accordance with commonly accepted design principles so as to create a sense of order and balance d massing large structures should be broken into smaller masses to provide human scale variation and depth these smaller masses should have a strong relationship to one another and ideally each smaller mass will have integrity of form construction of unadulterated warehousestyle big boxes should generally be avoided though their use is of less concern in industrial parks blocky multifamily structures within predominantly single and twofamily neighborhoods are highly inappropriate e roof  as a design element the roof has a significant effect on the buildings character the lack of a roof often promotes a feeling of boxiness the taller the building the less necessary is a pitched roof multistory buildings in downtown and mill buildings rarely included a pitched roof  incorporation of a moderate slope is preferred where flat roofs are used however there should be a distinct cornice andor parapet to emphasize the top of the building extensive areas of visible roof should be broken up with dormers cross gables cupolas chimneys parapets balustrades and towers f building facade  much attention should be given to create an attractive building facade broad expanses of blank walls are inappropriate traditionally the parts of a facade that might be embellished or at least articulated in some fashioninclude a the horizontal base where the building meets the ground such as a different treatment for the foundation b the horizontal top where the building meets the sky such as a projecting cornice with brackets c a horizontal section in between such as a belt course between stories d the vertical corners on the left and right sides such as corner boards or quoins e vertical articulation in the middle such as pilasters f the area around the doorentry such as a portico g the areas around the windows such as window surrounds  in addition depth may be created for the facade of porches projecting or recessed sections bay windows or arcades g fenestration  windows are an integral part of a building and should be incorporated on front facades and preferably side facades to humanize the building it is desirable that the windows along with the door establish a coherent orderly pattern and rhythm  it is preferable that windows be vertical or at least no more squat than square except as described in cbd area below horizontally shaped windows are discouraged where horizontal windows are sought a series of contiguous vertical windows with mullions in between should be used arranged in a horizontal band  in pedestrianoriented downtown or waterfront commercial centers use of large picturetype windows for retail uses on the first floor is strongly encouraged in residential areas and on upper floors of downtown buildings use of multiple panes of glass or the appearance of multiple panes rather than picturetype windows is preferred  shutters where appropriate should be sized properly for the window opening approximately 12 the width of the opening h entrance  the entrance is an important element in defining a building articulation of the entrance is encouraged of a portico canopy awning sidelights surround or other device  generally there should be an entrance if not the primary entrance located on the front facade use of a usable front porch on residential buildings is strongly encouraged i materials  the use of natural materials or materials that appear natural is preferred materials should be high quality and durable wood clapboard and shakes brick stone fiber reinforced stucco textured block and terracotta

fees shall be accounted for separately shall be segregated from the citys general fund may be spent upon order of the city council and shall be used solely for the capital improvements for which it was collected or to recoup the cost of capital improvements made in anticipation of the needs which the fee was collected to meet in the event that bonds or similar debt instruments have been or will be issued by the city of dover or the dover school district for the funding of capital improvements that are the subject of impact fee assessment impact fees from the appropriate related capital facility impact fee accounts may be applied to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments 2 assessment and collection a where subdivision or site plan approval is required for new development impact fees shall be assessed at the time of planning board approval of a subdivision plat or site plan the amount of such assessment shall be applicable to subsequent building
