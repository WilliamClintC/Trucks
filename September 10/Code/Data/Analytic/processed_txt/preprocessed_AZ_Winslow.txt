the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristics must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners or to any other features added to the property by the owners it is the duty of the city of winslow to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate part 2013  appeal board athe floodplain board of winslow shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter bthe floodplain board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in

consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and 1the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10the expected heights velocity duration

public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water system and streets and bridges dupon consideration of the factors of subsection c of this section and the purposes of this chapter

written notice over the signature of a community official that 1the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance  and 2such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property  and 3the land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of state land

for the repair rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure
