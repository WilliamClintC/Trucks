       41 1004 effective date                   41 introduction ~ashington county is but one of the land areas making up the saint t inneapolis seven county metropolitan area its present land use a~~cter is varied  as in any area but predominantly it is made of ricultural land units its proximity to the core of the metropolitan ea suggests that with the forecasted expansion of population the land e in washington county will continue to change as it has in the last fteen years in regard to land use the changes will be in the direction smaller pieces of land for housing and commercial uses and finally rge scale commercial use such as sales office multiple dwelling or ncentrated housing developments during the course of such change on a large or small scale land ldings are divided into lots with provision for new streets and for the sic utilities such as power telephone water and sewer this conversion land into building sites is a process which requires careful regulation ensure an attractive efficient and safe community environment ovision must also be made for possible future resubdivision for after e subdivision of a land parcel has been approved and buildings permitted e same standards must be met by future resubdivision the division nbination or resubdivision of land parcels are the first step in shaping ~ physical character of a community and as such are important process ich should be subject to public regulation adequate uptodate subdivision regulations as well as good 1inistration and enforcement are the tools to control the change in land ~ these subdivision regulations must reflect the desire of the county o ined in its comprehensive development plan because the countys ~l  will vary as an area progresses toward urbanization both the 1prehensive plan and subdivision regulations need periodic review   ally of course the zoning requirements outline the actual land area ge controlled by the subdivision regulations within the framework of the prehensi ve plan why plat the land use pattern of washington county is changing from an icultural land use which required large parcels of land to an urban i use requiring much smaller parcels land has been bought and sold ng metes and bounds descriptions but now with smaller parcels being ht and sold the practice of describing them by metes and bounds is no ~er practical many metes and bounds descriptions past and present written by 1alified people do not properly describe conveyance of land overlaps gaps have been created by these poor descriptions and can only be ~ected by the courts descriptions based on a good boundary survey can ~hecked therefore the record plat is a highly desirable instrument underlying description of the property to be platted can be adjusted or ected based on a boundary survey the recorded plat then becomes a 1 rlocument denoting lots and blocks as the subdivision of the described t  land clean simple and accurate conveyances can then be made and r l as lot blockplat name 1 ~         ~_i      ~  ~ ~~  ~ ~       1_  t      i 1    the present platting system was established to provide a simple system for keeping records of the division and owneiship of land minnesota statutes give the registered land surveyor exclusive rights to prepare plats the statutes also set minimum standards that the surveyor must meet and regulate the plat itself as to information required size number and kind the reader is referred to the minnesota statutes the standard procedures for platting in washington county how platting is accomplished prior to the preparation of a plat the subdividers or owners should meet with local officials with the washington county planning department and the county engineer in order to be made fully aware of all applicable ordinances regulations and plans in the area to be subdivided at this time or at a subsequent informal meeting the subdivider should submi~ a general sketch plan of the proposed subdivision and preliminary proposals for the provision of water supply and waste disposal the sketch plan can be presented in simple form but should show any zoning changes which would be required and should show that consideration has been given to the relationship of the proposed subdivision to existing community facilities that would serve it to neighboring subdivisions and development and to the topography of the site the subdivider is urged to avail himself of the advice and assistance of the planning department and the local governing body at this point in order to save time and effort and facilitate the approval of the plat the next step is for the subdivider to prepare a preliminary plat for the area to be subdivided the preliminary plat is a very detailed drawing showing the proposed development and necessary accessory information it contains more detail than is required on the sketch plan and serves as the basis for the public hearing it also serves as the master plan for a development where subdividing a piece of land is carried out stepwise by a series of plats where the first plat which is approved and recorded may be only part of the total plan and may later be followed by other plats all in conformity with the overall plan after the preliminary plat is approved the subdivider will have his surveyor prepare a final plat covering all or part of the land to be subdivided the final plat is a legal document designed primarily to record in the county offices the exact boundaries and location of parcels of land before the governing body will approve the plat it will usually require the subdivider to agree to do certain things such as pave streets the governing body will make sure that all such matters are agreed to by the subdivider and are covered as necessary by written contract and by bond before the plat is approved 2     ~  y    the following briefly outlines the platting processfor  unincorporated communities in washington county 1 prepare sketch plan meet with township officials and planning department to discuss zoning requirements and platting procedure 2 prepare preliminary plat submit seven 7 copies to county surveyor in order to be placed on agenda for washington county plat commission 3 submit preliminary plat to township officials for review and public hearing after review by the washington county plat commission 4 submit preliminary plat to watershed district for review and approva~ if lakeshore property preliminary plat must also be submitted to the minnesota department of natural resources 5 prepare final plat after the washington county plat commission and local governing body has given preliminary plat approval submit copies to county surveyor and to the washington county_plat commission for approval 6 submit final plat to township officials for approval 7 obtain all required signatures and final approval by county board 3 purpose 101 the process of dividing raw land into home sites or lparate parcels for other uses is one of the most important factors l the growth of any community few activities have a more lasting feet upon its appearance and environment once the land has been 1bdivided into urban lots and the streets homes and other ~ructures have been constructed the basic character of this rmanent addition to the community has become firmly established ~ is then virtually impossible to alter its basic character without 1bstantial expense in most subdivisions roads and streets must be ~intained and various public service must be provided the welfare  the entire community is thereby affected in many important ~spects it is therefore to the interest of the general public 1e developer and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived ~signed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper tandards all subdivisions of land hereafter submitted for approval shall ~lly comply in all respects with the regulations set forth erein it is the purpose of these regulations to 1 encourage well planned efficient and attractive subdivisions by establishing adequate standards for design and construction  2 provide for the health and safety of residents by requiring properly designed streets and adequate sewage and water service 3 place the cost of improvements against those benefiting from their construction  4 secure the rights of the public with
