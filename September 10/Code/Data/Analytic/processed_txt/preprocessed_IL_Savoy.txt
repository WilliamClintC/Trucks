expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 7 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a subjectmatter index with complete crossreferencing locates

broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example can be added between section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the

will such service be provided    service to contiguous annexable propertyannexation or agreement required if the proposed property subdivision or tract of land is contiguous to property within the village limits and is thus annexable then connection of sanitary sewers to the village sewer system will be denied until either a such property subdivision or tract is annexed to the village  or b the

release rate of excess storm water runoff from an owners land shall not exceed the rate of runoff which would have occurred from that owners land prior to the development of that owners land it is presumed that prior to development that owners land had a traditional agricultural use it is further presumed that the maximum safe storm water drainage capacity for downstream storm water drainage
