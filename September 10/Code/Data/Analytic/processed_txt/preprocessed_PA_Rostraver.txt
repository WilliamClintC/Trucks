rostraver township stormwater management  statement of findings the governing body of the rostraver township finds that a stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens public health and safety by causing increased runoff flows and velocities which overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers and greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c these impacts happen mainly decrease in natural infiltration of stormwater d a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and other activities causing loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater f federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a federal permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes g nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the municipality  1641 general provisions

design criteria for stormwater planning and management for both new and redeveloped sites c utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems as much as possible d manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source which requires a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes e focus on infiltration of stormwater to prevent degradation of surface and ground water quality and to otherwise protect water resources f maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the municipality and commonwealth g meet legal water quality requirements under state law including regulations at 25 pa 4a to protect and maintain existing uses and maintain the level of water quality to support those uses in all streams and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection streams h prevent stream bank and streambed scour and erosion i provide for proper operations and maintenance of all permanent stormwater management facilities that are constructed

chapter the chapter also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules in addition all plans must be reviewed by westmoreland county conservation district officials to ensure that established water quality standards will be maintained during and after development of the site and that postconstruction runoff levels are consistent with any local and regional watershed plans b to prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff the township of rostraver has developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new development sites these standards apply to any construction activity disturbing 5000 or more square feet of land the following activities may be exempt from these stormwater performance criteria 1 any logging and agricultural activity which is consistent with an approved soil conservation plan or a timber management plan prepared or approved by westmoreland county conservation district as applicable 2 additions or modifications to existing singlefamily structures less than 1000 square feet 3 developments that do not disturb more than 5000 square feet of land and do not create more than 1000 square feet of impervious surface provided that they are not part of a larger common development plan 4 repairs to any stormwater treatment practice deemed necessary by the township of rostraver c when a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a redevelopment project as defined in of this chapter decisions on permitting and onsite stormwater requirements shall be governed by stormwater sizing criteria found in the current chapter this criteria is dependent on the
