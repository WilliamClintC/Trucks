325 persons per dwelling shall be utilized for singlefamily dwellings and an average of 225 persons per dwelling unit shall be utilized for twofamily and multifamily dwellings if the types of dwelling units are interspersed throughout a given development eg a planned unit development the formula will have to be utilized for each different type of dwelling unit and the amount of land to be dedicated will be the sum of all the calculations bamount of fee in lieu of dedication where a fee is required to be paid in lieu of the land dedication the amount of such fee to be paid by a subdivider or developer pursuant to this chapter shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land which would be required to be dedicated pursuant to and calculated in accordance with the following formula  fee in lieu of land   amount of dedicated land x fair market value of land per dedication acre  cdetermination of land value for fee for the purpose of computing the feein lieu payment it is

follows but in no event shall the fair market value of land exceed ten thousand dollars $10000 per acre 1time fair market value shall be determined as of the filing of the final plat map 2basis the

been developed or improved by the installation or construction of streets roads curbs gutters sidewalks storm sewers sanitary sewers water lines or similar improvements the value of raw land shall be determined by averaging the value of all the acreage in the subdivision development or lot split and deducting therefrom the current fair market value of existing improvements thereon 3method fair market value shall be determined by negotiation if the fair market value of the land in question cannot be negotiated satisfactorily by the municipality and the subdivider or developer then an appraisal board shall be appointed to determine the fair market value such board shall consist of three qualified real estate appraisers one selected by the municipality at its own expense  one selected by the property owner at his or her own expense  and one selected agreement by the other two appraisers and paid jointly and equally by the municipality and the property owner the decision of such board shall be final dchoice of dedication or fee 1generally the responsibility for determining whether a subdivider or developer is to dedicate park land pay a fee in lieu of such dedication or provide a combination of such dedication and payment rests with council although the basic objective of this section is to require the dedication of park land situations may often arise where such a dedication would be neither compatible with the parks and recreation plan nor in the best interest of the neighborhood involved this is especially the case in small subdivisions or developments where the dedicated parcels of land might be too small to effectively use and too expensive to maintain 2procedure the procedure for determining whether the subdivider or developer is to dedicate land pay a fee or both is as follows aresponsibility of subdivider at the time of filing a preliminary plat map for approval the owner of the property shall as a part of such filing indicate whether he or she wishes to dedicate property for park and recreational purposes to pay a fee in lieu thereof or to meet the requirements combination of the two if he or she wishes or is required to dedicate land for this purpose he or she shall designate the area thereon on the preliminary plat map as submitted bresponsibility of developer at the time of applying for a building permit and in the event the land dedication would be two acres or more the owner of the property shall as a part of such application indicate whether he or she wishes to dedicate property for park and recreational purposes to pay a fee in lieu thereof or to meet the requirements combination of the two if he or she wishes to dedicate land for this purpose or if the required land dedication would be two acres or more then he or she shall prepare a map of the proposed development and designate the area therein where the development is of such a size that the land dedication would be less than two acres then only the payment of a fee in lieu shall be required and no review by the planning board or approval by council as provided for in this section is required however this shall not preclude the developer and the municipality from agreeing to the dedication of land or a combination of land dedication and fee payment caction by planning board all preliminary and final plat maps except those of a totally nonresidential nature shall be submitted to the planning board and council the planning board shall encourage every subdivider to submit one preliminary plat map of his or her entire proposed subdivision rather than several preliminary plat maps or smaller tract areas so that recommendations for the proposed park sites may be properly considered and developed furthermore the board shall encourage subdividers to work together in cooperative effort since situations may develop where it would be more advisable to have a single park serving several contiguous subdivisions than several smaller separate parks if a developer wishes to dedicate land andor if the required land dedication would be two acres or more then a map of the proposed development shall be submitted to the board for its recommendations daction by council council after it has received the comments and recommendations of the board and at the time of the preliminary plat map approval shall determine as a part of such approval whether to require a dedication of land within the subdivision the payment of a fee in lieu thereof or a combination of the two council at the time of final plat map approval shall again review the comments and recommendations of the board shall determine whether the final plat map has been prepared in accordance with the agreements reached and guidelines established at the time of the preliminary plat map approval and shall confirm that the provisions of this section are satisfied prior to the approval and recording of the final plat map council in a case involving a development where the potential land dedication would be two acres or more or in a case involving a development where the developer is proposing a land dedication of less than two acres shall determine after it has received a copy of the proposed development map and the recommendations of the board whether to require a dedication of land within the development the payment of a fee in lieu thereof or a combination of the two these conditions shall be made prior to the approval and issuance of any building permit for the development council may also take such action as it deems appropriate which is at variance with a recommendation of the planning board provided such action is approved by at least five votes of the members of council 3determination whether council accepts the land dedication or elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof or a combination of the two shall be determined after consideration of the following acompatibility with the principles and standards of the land use plan  btopography geology access and location of land in the subdivision or development available for dedication  and csize and shape of the subdivision or development and land available for dedication the determination by council as to a dedication a fee or a combination of both shall be final and conclusive esuitability of land any land to be dedicated under this section shall be reasonably adaptable for use for active park and recreation purposes and shall be at a location convenient to the people to be served factors used in evaluating the adequacy of proposed park and recreation areas shall include but not be limited to the following 1unity the dedicated land shall form a single parcel of land except where council determines that two parcels or more would be in the best public interest 2shape the shape of the dedicated parcel of land shall be sufficiently geometric to be usable for softball tennis football and other recreational pursuits 3location the dedicated land shall be located so as to serve the recreation and open space needs of the subdivision for which the dedication was made the recreation land in a subdivision must be located so as to be reasonably accessible from all lots in the subdivision 4access public access to the dedicated land shall be provided preferably by adjoining street frontage but also possibly by a public easement to the dedicated parcel such easement shall be sufficiently wide so that maintenance equipment has reasonably convenient access to the land 5usability the dedicated land shall be usable for recreational activities as a general rule steep slopes streams lakes watercourses and flood plains may be considered for only up to forty percent of the recreational land requirement and a minimum of sixty percent of the recreational land requirement shall be suitable for dry ground recreational use in this latter regard fifty percent of the dry ground recreation area shall not exceed three percent grade and the remaining dry ground recreation area shall not exceed five percent grade however where council determines that the recreational needs are already being adequately met either by other dedicated parcels of land or existing recreational facilities then land that is not usable for recreation activities may be dedicated as open space 6plans the land use plan the official thoroughfare plan and the housing element shall be taken into consideration when evaluating land proposals for dedication fpreservation of land 1natural features of scenic beauty such as trees plant life brooks and other watercourses topography historic spots views and similar conditions which if preserved will add attractiveness and value shall be considered and preserved whenever possible and practical in the dedication of open space and park and recreation areas 2where the land proposed to be dedicated has been adversely affected by the subdividers or developers operation or his or her lack of control over the use of the land or where it is necessary to alter or change to make it a suitable site by clearing grading drainage or a combination thereof a construction plan
