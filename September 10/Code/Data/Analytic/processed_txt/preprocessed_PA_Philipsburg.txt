thus they are not precisely geared to any one property the regulations were designed in this manner to avoid unequal unfair or arbitrary treatment of different property owners because these generalized regulations were not designed with any one property in mind  however it is possible in a few situations that they could prevent any use of a property the function of a variance is to provide relief from such a situation a variance gives a property owner or tenant permission to do something that violates a provision of this order to keep him or her from suffering an unnecessary hardship due to that provision however variances should not be given freely if every property owner or tenant who suffered any kind of a hardship due to the regulations of this granted a variance then this be completely unable to fulfill its purposes and would be nothing but a waste of time and money thus subsection 4 below specifies conditions that the zoning hearing board is to use to distinguish genuine unnecessary hardships from common inconveniences 2 who may apply for a variance any landowner or tenant who has the permission his or her landowner may apply for a variance 3 procedure for obtaining a variance a party listed in subsection 2 above who wishes to obtain a variance must submit a written application to the zoning officer on a form supplied by the borough this application shall specifically cite the provisions of this which the applicant is seeking relief after determining that the application is complete the zoning officer shall forward the application to the members of the zoning hearing board at the involved hearing zoning 2720  the zoning hearing board shall follow the procedure specified in 27702 zoning hearing board if the zoning hearing board decides to grant a variance it may attach any reasonable conditions that it feels are necessary to forward the purposes of this to the boards decision may be made to the centre county court of common pleas 4 conditions that the zoning hearing board is to use the zoning hearing board may only grant a variance when it makes all of the following five findings a there are unique and peculiar physical conditions present on the involved property such as the size shape or topography of the involved lot that were not created by the provisions of this because of these conditions there is no possibility that the involved property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this if these provisions were rigidly implemented the property would be virtually unusable and without any economic value c this unnecessary hardship was not created by the applicant property ownertenant or any of his or her predecessors d the variance requested if granted will not alter the essential character of the involved neighborhood or zoning district it will not substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of any adjacent properties and will not be detrimental to the public welfare e the variance if granted will be the smallest possible modification of the involved regulation that will provide relief from this regulation 14199 art i 157 27119 enforcement 1

select the second choice however all of the other named parties are free to choose from these options landowner curative amendments and substantive validity challenges are essentially the same type of appeal with some minor procedural differences a validity challenge must be in writing and contain reasons for the challenge but unlike the curative amendment does not have to contain materials describing the proposed development or amendments when a landowner curative amendment proposal is approved by borough council a substantive validity challenge is sustained by the zoning hearing board or the relevant court sustains either of these actions in a final appeal the involved developer may file a subdivision application within 2 years and apply for a zoning permit within 1 year without

applicability of this both a special exception and a conditional use are permissions granted to an applicant to use land in a zoning district for a purpose or land use that is not permitted outright ie that is not a permitted principal or accessory use in that district special exceptions and conditional uses are utilized by this merely allowing and not allowing land uses is too narrow for sound planning in some zoning districts some land uses fall in between what is consistent and what is not consistent with a districts planned way of life furthermore some uses should be located in a district but should be very carefully sited or controlled in order to protect the districts overall quality of life establishing a special exception conditional use system for philipsburg that allows such land uses in appropriate zoning districts subject to location and operation standards that are to protect the quality of life in those districts is the general purpose of this the major difference between special exceptions and conditional uses is that the former are granted or denied by the zoning hearing board while the latter are granted or denied by the borough council land uses that are allowed as special exceptions generally affect only their particular neighborhoods while land uses that are allowed as conditional uses may affect the entire borough and thus should be under the jurisdiction of the boroughs primary elected officials ie the council the multipage table under 272124 land uses offstreet parking and offstreet loading and other parts of this which land uses are

household residing in that unit and in a manner that is clearly incidental accessory and subordinate to the units primary residential use most modern zoning ordinances regulate home occupations because of the deleterious effects that these businesses can have on their neighborhoods a home occupation can congest its neighborhoods parking spaces and streets generate intrusive amounts of noise vibration glare electrical interference odors and radio television signal disruption draw large trucks for delivery purposes erect a disturbing number of signs utilize unsightly outdoor storage areas and generally change the character of its neighborhood from residential to commercial many zoning ordinances attempt to minimize such damaging effects by designating all home occupations as special exceptions and requiring each to procure the approval of the zoning hearing board which is to reject any such business that will adversely affect its neighborhood a however more and more home occupations are being created that have little or no deleterious effects on their neighborhoods many professionals now telecommute from home draw no extra parking or traffic activity generate no noise or other interference and have no signs while home occupations that could have a significant effect on their neighborhoods clearly should still lie under the zoning hearing boards jurisdiction those that have little or no such effects should be excused from the paperwork time and expense involved in a special exception application b this to establish such a system by dividing home occupations into two categories minor impact home occupations which will have little or no effect on their neighborhoods and major impact home occupazoning 2774  tions which may have some effects on their neighborhoods the zoning officer shall determine which of these categories a particular home occupation falls into according to the standards of subsection 2 below if a particular home occupation is determined to be a minor impact home occupation according to these standards then it may be established without any further approvals however if it is determined to be a major impact home occupation

zoning officer fails to make this determination within 15 days then the proposed home occupation shall automatically be classified as a minor impact home occupation c the zoning officer shall determine that a proposed home occupation would be a major impact home occupation unless it meets the standards below in which case it shall be classified as a minor impact home occupation and may be

within philipsburg however simply requiring a number of parking spaces or loading berths is not enough to guarantee adequate access to the boroughs homes businesses and institutions these spaces and berths need to be properly designed the purpose of this to meet this concern by mandating that each required offstreet parking space and loading berth meet certain safety and aesthetics criteria 2 of

parking and loading plans 1 purpose organization and applicability of this land uses offstreet parking and offstreet loading stipulates how many offstreet parking spaces and loading berths each land use within the borough of philipsburg must provide however simply requiring a number of parking spaces or loading berths ignores many important considerations parking and loading requirements should be flexible and responsive to situations involving shared parking adequate offlot parking different transportation modes and site constraints some land uses should not be held to the requirements of 27212 because they share parking spaces with other businesses who need parking at differing times they use parking spaces on other lots that are nearby a significant number of their clients walk or ride bicycles to these uses or existing site constraints prohibit following these requirements the purpose of this to meet this concern by allowing for reductions in these requirements if they are necessary and justified 2 of this the conditions under which one or more land uses may obtain an approved parking plan that reduces the offstreet parking requirements of 272123 stipulates the conditions under which one or more land uses may obtain an approved loading plan that reduces the offstreet loading requirements of 27212 applications for a parking or loading plan shall be made to

one of the following four forms a two or more uses may share a common parking area that provides enough parking spaces to meet the requirements of each use individually if the applicants prove that each involved use will require the common parking area largely when the other involved uses will not require it that each involved use is located within 350 feet of the common parking area that each involved use is connected to the common parking area by safe pedestrian means of access and that an adequate guarantee exists that the common parking area will remain available to all of the involved uses over their lifetimes this form of a parking agreement shall not be available to shopping centers or residential buildings with more than one dwelling however it is especially recommended for places of worship which usually require parking on weekends and after 5 pm on weekdays and nonretail office buildings which usually require parking between 9 am and 5 pm on weekdays any changes made to the sharing of the common parking area shall require a new review by the zoning hearing board and may result in an addition of required parking spaces b the zoning hearing board may approve a plan for providing some or all of a land uses required offstreet parking spaces on a different lot than that which the use is situated on if an adequate guarantee exists that the parking will remain available to the involved use over its lifetime and the offsite parking spaces are located within 350 feet of the associated use and are connected by a safe pedestrian walkway c if a land use can prove that over 25% of the traffic that it generates will be pedestrian the zoning hearing board may approve a plan that proportionately reduces the number of offstreet parking spaces required by 27212 furthermore if a land use can prove that over 25% of the traffic that it generates will use a bicycle to get there the zoning hearing board may approve a plan that proportionately reduces the number of offstreet parking spaces required by 27212 and provides enough bike rack space to handle the anticipated number of cyclists d the zoning hearing board may approve an offstreet parking plan that reduces the number of offstreet parking spaces required for a land use by 27 212 if the applicant can prove that existing site constraints bar any reasonable attempt to follow this requirement
