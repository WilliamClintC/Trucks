defined by statute to include all documentary materials or data regardless of physical form or characteristics made or received by an officer or employee of any agency or municipality of the commonwealth unless falling within a statutory exemption mgl c4 s7 therefore the secretary of the commonwealth advises that the public records law clearly applies to government records generated or

communications deprive the public of the chance contemporaneously to monitor the discussion but by excluding nonparticipating members such communications are also inconsistent with the collegial character of governmental bodies for these reasons the middlesex district attorney cautions that email messages among members of governmental bodies are best avoided except for matters of a purely

021 022 022 0222 28+ acres goals and objectives the goals of this management plan are to provide guidance for the management of the remaining land of the hugh cargill farm for its traditional uses and recommend an integrated plan for management of previously developed parcels excluding residentially developed areas together with the remaining hugh cargill farm traditional uses include drinking water protection and production agriculture benefit of the poor in concord wildlife protection maintenance of a scenic gateway into concord and the general enjoyment of concords citizens and school children open landscapes are declining regionally and in concord and this plan is intended to ensure that the hugh cargill farm land remain open by regular mowing or agricultural haying the cargill land provides a rural landscape on an important gateway into town as well as a connection with the hapgood wright town forest invasive plant species should be selectively removed over time in order to restore the biodiversity of this site these activities will be conducted in a way that maximizes the wildlife habitat provided by grasslands for butterflies small mammals and grassland nesting birds informal playing fields are also an accepted use under this plan no activity may be conducted that will adversely impact the water quality of the hugh cargill well although some of the original land has been carved off for other uses and acquisition funds placed in the trust to be disbursed to needy residents of concord this plan seeks to integrate management of all lands regardless of ownership within the original bounds to be managed for the goals and objectives stated above this will require coordination with the school department and concord water division and this plan shall serve as a tool to foster such collaboration with recognition that it shall not place new constraints on the established uses or existing controls afforded each independent authority no changes in permitted uses or hardscape improvements will be made to this site without public discussion and reference to the goals listed above this report recognizes that the intent of public discussion related to hardscape and permitted uses does not include cpw water division property and water supply which remains under the jurisdiction of concord public works and the public works commission in order to continue to meet the original intent of the benefactor of this land all net income generated on hugh cargill land parcels 0217 and 0222 will be deposited into the hugh cargill trust  history and site description hugh cargill was a british soldier who became an american and citizen of concord in 1799 he bequeathed the stratton farm to the town which was to be improved as a poorhouse and the land to be improved by and for the benefit of the poor and to be under the special direction of the town of concord for the time being for the purpose aforesaid forever the town ran the property as the poor farm until the second world war a period of about 140 years in the late 1940s the town petitioned the attorney general for release of portions of the farm from the trust for alcott school the police and fire station and in 1958 the hugh cargill well land was released from the trust for limited purposes and not for general purposes the alcott piece 27 acres was released from the trust for school purposes and the concord water division parcel 87 acres released for development and operation of a subsurface water supply today two parcels still remain in the trust the community garden piece 43 acres and one along thoreau street about 34 acres in size the north end of the original stratton farm is the location of the police and fire stations and a private residence  these are not considered as part of the site residential development to the south is also not considered part of the site the remaining cargill land is held by the town in four parcels parcels 021 022 022 0222 the site consists of the undeveloped portions of these four parcels as well as undeveloped portions of the alcott campus and hugh cargill well protection area about 285 acres of fields wetlands and woods ownership divisional responsibility and coordination the entire property is owned by the town of concord three divisions of the town have controlled the land since the 1950s this plan recommends that the natural resources division coordinate administration of this plan subject to approval from the school department and the water division on their respective lands the hugh cargill community garden parcel 0222 and the thoreau street parcel parcel 0217 remain in the trust and under the control of the selectmen the school committee and concord public works administer the alcott land parcel 0221 and the hugh cargill well field parcel 0220 respectively and this plan will be coordinated boards figure a denotes ownership of each parcel in addition to the principle uses noted above the site offers many opportunities for outdoor education and should be used to cultivate the next generation of land stewards from the alcott school and the concord carlisle regional high school to the extent possible land use decisions will be responsive to the intent of the original benefactor hugh cargill whose primary concern was for the poor of concord land use regulatory constraints much of the cargill farm lies within three zoning overlay districts floodplain wetlands and groundwater conservancy and work in these areas is subject to approval from the zoning board of appeals work in the 100year floodplain wetlands and 100foot buffer zone to wetlands is subject to approval of the natural resources commission mgl 310 cmr 1000 work in areas contributing to the hugh cargill well is subject  to approval from the public works commission and potentially the department of environmental protection these reflect real physical limitations related to very shallow groundwater 05 feet found on much of the site hugh cargill well in 200 the town gained approval from the massachusetts department of environmental protection ma dep to reactivate this drinking water supply based on the successfully reconfiguration of the withdrawal system and its ability to provide adequate landuse protection around the resulting wellheads this protection area includes the land owned by the concord water division plus an additional protection overlay delineated as the hugh cargill well protection area this protection area was approved under of the 2001 annual town meeting which includes a portion of town forest east of walden street and a portion of land owned by the school and the trust to the west use restrictions within these drinking water protection areas are outlined within the mgl 310 cmr 2200 these areas are shown on a recorded plan referred to in a recorded conservation restriction and their establishment was part of department of environmental protection dep approval of the new well field management overlays different sections of the cargill land have had different historical uses originally the land was entirely wooded a swampy or at least moist forest it was cleared and drained for farming probably in its entirety beginning in the 1700s mid1800s there has been partial reversion to forest in the wettest portions of the property an area along thoreau street more recently abandoned supports a shrub and herbaceous community figure b denotes management overlays recommended under this plan management overlays in this plan are based on current historical and potential use and these uses extend beyond the property lines of the divisional ownerships alcott campus this 107acre area includes the developed portion of the alcott parcel including the buildings parking lots existing ball fields and landscaped lawns the alcott campus is managed according to the needs and direction of the school committee this plan recommends that the school committee address the appearance of the walden street side of the new school lighting should be in conformance with town policy for shielded nonglare lighting  this is an otherwise dark part of town while the lighting was designed with the town standard in mind this plan recommends that the school committee investigate the possibility of reducing the impact of lighting on the walden street side landscaping with an eye toward eventual screening would soften the fully visible back end of the building though small trees are considerably more cost effective and may have better survivability than larger plantings this plan recognizes that smaller trees will take many years to mature and provide the desired screening the town tree warden should be consulted in preparing a planting plan  community gardens the hugh cargill community gardens occupy the northernmost field mostly on trust land grassland this includes the hugh cargill well protection area and adjoining portions of trust and school land a total of 191 acres this plan contemplates that a low impact playing field may be sited in the grassland overlay primarily on school land outside the alcott campus hugh cargill well protection area this area has been designated by the concord water division and is shown on a recorded plan approved by the state the boundaries of this 93acre area include a large portion of the water division land as well as small portions of trust and school land it lies entirely within the grassland overlay woodland there are two wooded areas  55 acres of school property along laurel and thoreau streets and 39 acres of school and trust land at the north end of the alcott campus for a total 94 acres uses permissible uses may extend across ownership boundaries this plan recognizes that any activity on school department or water division land will need approval before implementation and may require approval from other local boards and committees such as the natural resources commission and zoning board of appeals protection of water quality within the hugh cargill well protection area is of the highest priority all permitted uses must conform to guidelines established by the concord water division and mgl 310 cmr 2200 to ensure the highest quality groundwater is maintained at a minimum no use of pesticides herbicides or fertilizers within the well protection area is permitted without approval of the concord water division uses under this plan are identified below community gardens the community gardens portion of the trust land is intended to remain in community use under this plan this area is plowed by town personnel in the spring and administration is provided by the division of natural resources an annual contribution should be paid into the hugh cargill fund new alcott gardens could be sited on school or water division land haying under this plan haying is defined as an activity where fields are cut for production early cutting conducted more than once annually generally is preferred to maximize the quality of hay production and the profit realized from the investment  however the major threat to survival of grassland birds in hayed or mowed fields is early cutting before the young have fledged if the grassland supports grassland nesting birds at some point in the future mowing should wait until after the breeding season july 20 the mower height should be at least 6 inches off the ground so that small mammal habitat is retained after mowing if no grassland birds are present haying may be conducted earlier in the season haying should be done in a series of parallel lines from the inside out rather than conventional circular cutting to avoid herding small mammals to the center of the field where they may be killed by the mower see diagram vegetated buffers at least 25 feet should be maintained around both sides of the agricultural ditch trees and shrubs should be removed to favor native grasses and forbs long sight lines are critical for attracting ground nesting birds and desirable for landscape preservation haying will be conducted by lease to a local farmer overseen by the natural resources division in consultation with a farmer lessee a choice may be made to manage a portion of the grassland overlay for production of good quality hay with earlier mowing or for other agricultural use like small fruits but generally the intention is to protect wildlife with cutting only late in the season agricultural rents will be deposited into the hugh cargill trust mowing under this plan mowing is defined as an activity conducted to maintain land in its open state and to control woody invasives because there is no production associated with mowing compared to haying the need to cut early and often is eliminated timing and methodology of cutting and maintenance of vegetated buffers should follow the recommendations for haying  mowing should be conducted by concord public works or by lease to a farmer under direction of the division of natural resources a mowing schedule will be developed by the natural resources division with support from the concord water division the mowing schedule will be reviewed and approved by the concord water division on land owned by the concord water division  the school committee will review and approve the mowing schedule on land owned by the school department mowing may be conducted on a rotating schedule to provide flowers for butterflies throughout the growing season as well as adequate time for larvae and pupae to develop if rotational mowing is implemented care will be taken to ensure that woody species are kept in check low impact playing fields there may be locations within and adjacent to the alcott campus for low impact playing fields this management plan recognizes that informal playing fields may be developed on the alcott campus without reference to this plan such as the former alcott school parking lot if a playing field is constructed on the walden street side of the alcott campus this plan recommends that the field be created without extensive grading or permanent structures the field should be designed to revert to other uses identified in the plan if no longer needed as a playing field this field may be mowed more frequently to maintain turf  striped  and irrigated if necessary no permanent irrigation structures should be installed  irrigation structures should be temporary and moveable playing fields that extend into the grassland overlay should be laid so that the minimum amount of grading is required invasive species management portions of the site are becoming infested with invasive species including glossy buckthorn multiflora rose purple loosetrife and asiatic bittersweet invasive species threaten biological diversity and minimize wildlife habitat value and should be controlled regular mowing to the edge of fields may control some of these species other control methods will be speciesspecific and will be determined using best available literature and consultation with the new england wildflower society passive recreational trails recreational trails could be designed and built on the property if they are unpaved and do not interfere with other uses boardwalks are considered an acceptable component of recreational trails provided they are not pressuretreated in areas subject to natural resources commission jurisdiction possible trail locations would be between the high school and alcott school and between alcott school and walden street with potential offsite connections to the town forest and other town lands hugh cargill farm task force this plan was developed by the hugh cargill farm task force a committee that held several meetings in 2007 and 2008 the task force was represented by a diverse assemblage of interests for the management of this land we recognize that the needs of  this management plan may change over time and recommend that if future changes are contemplated the opinions of these committees and boards be sought the task force membership was as follows one member of the board of selectmen virginia mcintyre one member of the planning board jeff adams one member or designee of the school committee fabian fondriest one member or designee of the public works commission paul mahoney one representative from a youth sports organization pete castrichini one member or designee of the natural resources commission delia kaye one member or designee of the agriculture committee john bemis one member representing community gardening interests jim catterton one member or designee of the historical commission nancy butman alan cathcart concord water superintendent and rebecca purcell cocoordinator of the hugh cargill community garden attended many meetings and provided valuable insight to the plan development  appendix a  management recommendations beginning in spring 2008 resolve matter of excess fill left in location of temporary access road and turn around by ensuring that the original grades are reestablished recommend that the school committee consider landscaping improvements at walden street side of alcott to soften the view of the school from walden street if a low impact playing field is proposed cpw school department and dnr will work with the proponent to site this field volunteers remove invasive exotics along thoreau street elsewhere as determined by natural resources division invasives plants will be disposed of properly which may include burning chipping or removal to the concord recycling facility the trails committee will investigate the feasibility of locating a trail to foster connections between the high school and the town forest and other town lands cpw defines the areas which will be hand mown well field and which areas can be tractor mown with a goal of creating a natural and consistent landscape in consultation with the school committee cpw defines how much vegetation to remain along ditch that lies to the north of the well field in consultation with the division of natural resources natural resources division defines the areas which will be managed for grass by haying in consultation with the concord water division and the school committee once the area to be leased is determined the town will publicly bid the land to a local farmer with a goal of awarding bid within one month farming plan should include o mowing and brush hogging aesthetics prior to lease being awarded subject to presence of ground nesting birds  o consideration of rotating fields to provide wildlife habitat in certain areas summer and fall  o late summerearly fall plowing cover crop for winter  o harrowing and seeding for permanent grass the following spring  o no herbicides or pesticides fertilizer and lime only with permission of cpw and dnr  o possible limitation on date of first cutting as determined by dnr  if ground nesting birds are present first cut delayed until july 20 if not present hay cut at farmers discretion    o lease will provide that if an area is to be used for a low impact playing field this use will have precedence and that area will not be used for hay production until playing field is no longer used town of concord massachusetts hunting bylaw voted that the town repeal the bylaw relating to hunting in the town of concord adopted at the annual town meeting on  as approved

of bylaw enacted under of the 1987 annual town meeting which required the reservation of land in every new standard subdivision for the purchase by the town for housing purposes be repealed in its entirety and that the following be substituted in its place purpose to provide as a matter of public policy and within the subdivision process a means to address the affordable housing needs of the

conditions 71 administrative approvals activities considered minor in scope and that would predictably have no measurable or cumulative impact upon the resource areas protected by this bylaw may be reviewed and permitted by the natural resource director 72 decision if the commission after a public hearing and consideration of the general and specific factors set forth below determines that the

protected by this bylaw the commission within 21 days of the close of the hearing unless the applicant authorizes an extension in writing shall issue or deny a permit for the activities requested the decision shall be in writing 73 factors in making such a determination the commission shall take into account the following factors a the extent to which the applicant has avoided minimized and mitigated any such effect  b any loss degradation isolation and replacement or replication of such protected resource areas elsewhere in the community and the watershed resulting from past activities whether permitted unpermitted or exempt  and c foreseeable future activities 6 due consideration shall be given to any demonstrated hardship on the applicant by reason of denial as presented at the public hearing 74 specific factors a buffer zone in reviewing activities within the buffer zone the commission shall presume the buffer zone is important to the protection of other resource areas because activities undertaken in close proximity have a high likelihood of adverse impact either immediately as a consequence of construction or over time as a consequence of daily operation or existence of the activities these adverse impacts from construction and use can include without limitation erosion siltation loss of groundwater recharge poor water quality and loss of wildlife habitat b riverfront area in reviewing activities within the riverfront area the commission shall presume the riverfront area is important to all the resource area values unless demonstrated otherwise and no permit issued hereunder shall permit any activities unless the applicant in addition to meeting the otherwise applicable requirements of this bylaw has proved by a preponderance of the credible evidence that 1 there is no practicable alternative to the proposed project with less adverse effects and that 2 such activities including proposed mitigation measures will have no significant adverse impact on the areas or values protected by this bylaw the commission shall regard as practicable an alternative which is reasonably available and capable of being done after taking into consideration the proposed property use overall project purpose eg residential institutional commercial or industrial logistics existing technology costs of the alternatives and overall project costs c resource area loss to prevent resource area loss the commission shall require applicants to avoid alteration wherever feasible  to minimize alteration  and where alteration is unavoidable and has been minimized to provide full mitigation the commission may authorize or require replication of wetlands as a form of mitigation but only with specific plans professional design proper safeguards adequate security and professional monitoring and reporting to assure success because of the high likelihood of failure of replication d certified vernal pools the commission shall presume that all areas meeting the definition of vernal pools under 40 of this bylaw including the adjacent vernal pool habitat perform essential habitat functions this presumption may be overcome only by the presentation of credible evidence which in the judgment of the commission demonstrates that the area does not provide essential habitat functions any formal evaluation should be performed by an individual who at least meets the qualifications under the wildlife habitat section of the wetlands protection act regulations 310 cmr 1000 e setbacks the commission shall presume that any activity or alteration within 25 feet of any freshwater wetlands marshes wet meadows bogs swamps springs banks beaches reservoirs lakes ponds and lands under water bodies intermittent streams brooks and creeks and perennial rivers and streams has a significant individual or cumulative impact upon the resource area values protected by this bylaw and shall be prohibited i this presumption may be overcome where applicant can clearly demonstrate with credible evidence the proposed activity or alteration would have no individual or cumulative impact upon any of the resource area values protected by this bylaw in accordance with the regulations hereunder alternatively the commission may waive the setback if it determines that an applicant satisfies the waiver requirements in 77 ii the following shall not be subject to this setback presumption routine maintenance repairs and construction on legally preexisting structures so long as there is no expansion 7 in the structure  the installation of public or private utilities along or within legally existing roadways and driveways  continuation of a legally preexisting use  or the construction and maintenance of publicly maintained trails that restrict the use of motorized vehicles maintenance repairs and construction shall be subject to all other requirements under this bylaw and its regulations hereunder 75 conditions upon the issuance of a permit the

where no conditions are adequate to protect said resource area values the commission is empowered to deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements of this bylaw the commission may also deny a permit a for failure to submit necessary information and plans requested by the commission  b for failure to comply with the procedures design specifications performance standards and other requirements in regulations of the commission  or c for failure to avoid minimize or mitigate unacceptable significant or cumulative effects upon the resource area values protected by this bylaw 77 waivers the commission may waive specifically identified and requested procedures design specifications performance standards or other requirements set forth in its regulations provided that a the commission finds in writing after said public hearing that there are no reasonable conditions or alternatives that would allow the proposed activity to proceed in compliance with said regulations  b that avoidance minimization and mitigation have been employed to the maximum extent feasible  and either c the project considered in its entirety would result in a net benefit of resource area values  or d that the waiver is necessary to accommodate an overriding public interest or to avoid a decision that so restricts the use of the property as to constitute an unconstitutional taking without compensation 78 expiration of permit a permit determination of applicability doa or order of resource area delineation orad shall expire three years from the date of issuance the commission may extend a permit for one or more periods of up to three years each upon written request from the applicant made at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the permit notwithstanding the above the commission
