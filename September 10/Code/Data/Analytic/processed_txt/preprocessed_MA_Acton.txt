the elevation of the top of the tower structure including any antennas or other appurtenances above the preconstruction mean ground elevation directly at the base of the pole  or b the elevation of the tower structure including any antennas or other appurtenances above the mean ground elevation within 500 feet of the base of the pole 4 personal wireless towers shall be cams on a case by case

room and structural capacity for all necessary cables and antennas b the planning board may require the owner of such tower to permit other providers to colocate at such facility upon payment of a reasonable charge which shall be determined by the planning board if the parties cannot agree town of acton zoning bylaw april 2019  c the planning board may require that the equipment of all users of a tower shall be subject to rearrangement on the tower or in the equipment compound if so directed by the planning board at a later time in its effort to maximize colocation of carriers this may result in different vertical antenna locations reduced vertical separation of antennas and changes of antenna arrangements to the extent feasible without causing technically unacceptable radio frequency signal interference between the antennas of the colocators and without creating new significant gap in the existing coverage of incumbent providers on the tower d the planning board may require that the equipment of all carriers on a tower shall be subject to relocation to another nearby facility if such relocation when considered individually or in concert with existing or potential new facilities does not create a significant gap in the carriers coverage when so directed by the planning board at a later time in its effort to maximize colocation of carriers it may then order the removal of a tower after the relocation is completed e the planning board may require longterm easements leases licenses or other enforceable legal instruments that fully support a facility at its maximum potential technical capacity including sufficient space on the tower and for facility base equipment to accommodate the maximum number of technically feasible colocators at the site adequate access and utility easements to the facility from a public street and the right for the maximum number of technically feasible colocators to colocate on the tower and to upgrade the utilities and

also approve the installation of communication devices by entities other than personal wireless service carriers as secondary occupants of a facility that are subject to planning board termination upon six months notice of the planning board provided that they do not interfere with the personal wireless services and that the intent of this bylaw to maximize colocation of personal wireless service providers is not compromised 13 the planning board shall in its special permit make adequate provisions for the removal of the tower and equipment compound after its use for personal wireless services has ended it shall require that the facility location shall be restored to preexisting conditions as much as is reasonably possible so that no traces of the facility including foundation

demonstrating that other methods preferred by the town are not feasible for providing service coverage to satisfy such significant gap  d cannot for technical or physical reasons be located on an existing personal wireless facility or tower that would be expected to provide comparable service coverage such alternative existing location or locations need not provide full service to the entire significant gap if in the determination of the planning board the remaining gap to have been served by the proposed facility is not significant andor if remaining portions of the significant gap can be served by new facilities preferred by the planning board  e cannot be located at any other practicably available site that is less objectionable to the general public due to technical requirements

request for such waivers shall be supported by a study prepared by a qualified radio frequency engineer or other qualified professional consultant demonstrating to the planning boards satisfaction that there exists a significant gap in coverage within the specific geographic area proposed and clear and convincing evidence that no alternative locations technologies andor configurations are available that meet the otherwise applicable requirements b in granting such a waiver or waivers the planning board must find that the extent of the granted relief is mitigated by showing that any alternative for serving the significant gap that is feasible is no less objectionable in its impact on the community that all practicable mitigation of the proposed facilitys impact is incorporated in the design and conditions and that the desired relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the neighborhood and without denigrating from the intent and purpose of this bylaw c however the board shall not grant relief from the maximum height limitation in d the board shall be empowered hereunder to grant relief from any setback requirements in subsections 6 or 7 provided that the

town of acton the purpose of the groundwater protection district is to protect the public health safety and welfare by protecting the towns limited present and future drinking water supply to ensure a sufficient quantity of potable pure drinking water for the present and future residents of acton to prevent temporary and permanent contamination of groundwater and surface water and to limit the adverse effects of the use and development of land on the quality and quantity of the groundwater and surface water resources of the town of acton the groundwater protection district is an overlay district whose boundaries are superimposed on all districts established by this bylaw and whose regulations are in addition to any other regulations established by this bylaw the regulations in this district are not intended to supersede or limit the protections contained in state or federal groundwater protection programs but to supplement protections contained in other statutes and regulations the groundwater protection district encompasses the entire town but it is divided into four separate protection zones the regulations for which vary depending on their proximity to the towns present and future drinking water supply wells  district boundaries  the groundwater protection district is divided into four protection zones as follows 1 zone 1  well protection area the area from which groundwater will travel to a pumping municipal well within a one year time period based on average recharge conditions and anticipated pumping as established in the groundwater protection district map of the town of acton january 1989 prepared by goldberg zoino and associates gza in the final report  aquifer protection zones town of acton massachusetts january 1989 2 zone 2  the recharge protection area  the area within which groundwater will move toward a pumping municipal well at the end of a 180 day period of no surficial recharge and full design capacity pumping of the well as more fully defined by the massachusetts department of environmental protection in 310 cmr 2202 established in the groundwater protection district map of the town of acton january 1989 as last amended and most recently adopted by town meeting for the clappwhitcomb and the school street well fields the zone 2 delineation was prepared by goldberg zoino and associates gza in the final report  aquifer

areas planned for limited development with longterm revenue increases in areas planned for concentrated development  and e to accomplish the above objectives in a manner in which landowners are compensated for reductions in longterm development potential with other landowners who benefit from increases in development potential thus the provisions of this intended primarily to change the pattern and location of future development within the town rather than to change the overall amount or type of such development  and to accomplish such intended changes in a way that is equitable to
