statutory authorization the legislature of the state of mississippi has in mca 197 tit 17 ch 1 delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the city of biloxi mississippi does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations  52306 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages  52306 purpose of chapter it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channel and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage and  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  52306 objectives of chapter the objectives of this chapter are to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines street and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas and 7 ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area  52306 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  4 controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas  52306 definitions the following words terms and phrases when

that name the use of prefixes suffixes or other minor changes shall not be sufficient to allow reuse of a street name b no new development name or proposed renaming of an existing development shall duplicate be phonetically similar to or create confusion with an existing development name unless the development to be so named is an additional phase of the original development bearing that name and includes direct internal street connections to that development the use of prefixes suffixes or other minor changes shall not be sufficient to allow reuse of a development name c it is desirable to use names which are simple logical easy to read and pronounce and which are clear and brief use of frivolous or complicated words or unconventional spellings shall not be approved d in all cases names that might reasonably be perceived as offensive shall not be permitted e the use of numbers such as first street alphabetical letters or proper names is discouraged f it is desirable to use names that have some association with the city and specifically with the immediate location of the road or place such as reference to local history or physiographic features g use of a common theme is

direction shall be considered to be continuous and be so named where there is a possibility of extending either section in the future such configuration shall be considered to be an intersection and different names assigned o where there is a change in the direction of a street of greater than 60 degrees for a distance equal to or exceeding 1000 feet in length each segment of the street shall bear a different name p the proposed name of the development should in all respects emphasize the projects distinctive name rather than the name of the company or corporation that owns the development

classifications of land use and include residential uses institutional uses agricultural uses commercial uses and industrial uses use classifications are further broken down into a series of general use categories and specific use types b use categories the use categories describe the major subgroups of the respective use classifications and are based on common functional product or physical characteristics such as the type and amount of activity the type of customers or residents how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions for example the residential use classification is divided into the household living and group living use categories use categories are further broken down into a series of individual use types c use types the specific use types are included in the respective use category they identify the specific principal uses that are considered to fall within characteristics identified in the use category for example livework dwellings singlefamily detached dwellings townhouse multifamily dwellings and manufactured homes are use types in the household living use category 3 permitted uses a p in a cell of a use table indicates that

the balancing of the rights of those who conduct regulated business uses and the rights of those who conduct the uses from which regulated businesses must be separated a some protected uses may be established on a very temporary basis in old storefronts or other transitory premises because one effect of these separation standards is to limit the number of sites available where regulated business uses can be conducted the establishment of temporary protected uses in such locations may further restrict the number of locations in which regulated business uses are allowed to the extent that the regulation may not be fair to those conducting such uses and in some cases may even raise constitutional concerns  b if an operator of one of the uses protected by the separation requirements decides to move to a location nearer one of the regulated business uses than the separation requirements set out in the table the operator of that use has apparently determined that the concerns of the city in establishing these criteria do not apply to it under those circumstances it is neither appropriate nor necessary to limit the future operation or expansion of one or more of the regulated business uses based on the free choice of the operator of the protected use c if the city council approves the rezoning of any lot of record any regulated business approved for operations by the city prior to the adoption of the amendment to the official zoning map shall not be required to comply with the separation requirements set out in table 2343d11 required minimum spacing between regulated

districts or other uses listed in the table b an application for a conditional use permit site plan certificate of zoning compliance building permit or certificate of occupancy for any regulated business use including an application for approval of a site plan building permit or certificate of occupancy that would allow an expansion of the use by more than five percent of its gross floor area shall be subject to the application of the separation requirements c a building permit or certificate of occupancy for remodeling that involves a reduction in gross floor area or an expansion of less than five percent of the gross floor area of the use shall not be subject to the application of these standards 3 exemptions the spacing requirements in table 2343d11 required minimum spacing between regulated business uses and protected uses shall not apply in the following circumstances a the spacing requirements as provided for the establishment of bars lounges and nightclubs shall not apply to these specific regulated business uses when located within a downtown dt or community redevelopment overlay cro district b if the existing use from which the spacing requirement is to be measured has existed in that location for less than one year the spacing requirement from that use shall be applied only if the director of community development determines that the holder of the business license for the premises or other active user owns the property c if the application is for an expansion of an existing regulated business use the spacing requirements in the table shall not be applied to require its spacing from any use established after the later of  or the date of initial establishment of the regulated business use table 2343d11 required minimum spacing 1 between regulated business

retention standards a table 2364f4 tree canopy retention standards establishes the minimum percentage of a development sites existing tree canopy cover that is required to be retained and protected based on the sites existing tree canopy cover and its base zoning district designation the table identifies minimum required tree canopy retention requirements for existing tree canopy cover at six percentage points 100% 80% 60% 40% 20% and 0% b where the existing tree canopy cover falls between two percentage points show on the table eg 65% the following calculations shall be undertaken to determine minimum required tree canopy retention 1 in the a re rer and rs districts add 025 to the minimum required tree canopy retention percentage for each percentage point the existing tree canopy cover falls below a percentage point identified in the first column of the table figure 2364f4 existing tree canopy retention example for where 65 pecent of the development site is covered by existing tree canopy because 65 percent is 15 percentage points below the 80 percent existing tree canopy cover shown on the table 15  025 or 375 percentage points are added to the 24 percent minimum required tree canopy retention designated for an existing tree canopy cover of 80 percent yielding a minimum required tree canopy retention of 2775 percent 24 percent + 375 percent for an existing tree canopy cover of 65 percent see a graphic depiction of other examples in figure 2364f4 existing tree canopy retention 2 in the rm rmh lb nb and wf districts the same calculation is made except  is added to

deposited without interest   nonconformities 1  general applicability a  purpose and scope in the provisions established by this there exist uses of land structures lots of record signs and other site features that were lawfully established before this adopted or amended but do not conform to its terms and requirements it is the general policy of the city to allow such uses structures lots signs and other site features to continue to exist and be put to productive use it also is the policy of the city however to bring as many nonconformities into conformance with this is reasonably practicable subject to the requirements of this article the purpose and intent of this article is to recognize the interests of the property owner in continuing to use the property but to preclude the expansion of a nonconformity or reestablishment of a discontinued or substantially destroyed nonconformity unless allowing such expansion or reestablishment can serve as an incentive to achievement of even greater public benefit b  applicability this article applies to nonconformities created by initial adoption of or amendments to this also applies to a use structure lot sign and other site feature that was a legal nonconformity under a similar provision of a previously applicable ordinance of the city or county and that remains nonconforming with one or more provisions of this even if the type or extent of nonconformity is different c  continuation allowed nonconformities are allowed to continue and are encouraged to receive routine maintenance in accordance with the requirements of this article as a means of preserving safety and appearance d  determination of nonconformity status the burden of establishing that a nonconformity lawfully exists shall be the responsibility of the owner of the land on which the alleged nonconformity is located e  minor repairs and maintenance minor repairs and normal maintenance that are required to keep nonconforming uses structures lots of record and signs in a safe condition are permitted provided the minor repair or maintenance does not increase the extent of the nonconformity for the purposes of this subsection minor repair or normal maintenance shall mean 1 repairs that are necessary to maintain a nonconforming use structure lot of record or sign in a safe condition  and 2 maintenance of land areas to protect against health hazards and promote the safety of surrounding uses f  change of tenancy or ownership the status of a nonconformity is not affected by changes of tenancy ownership or management 2  nonconforming uses a  general nonconforming uses are declared generally incompatible with the permitted uses in the district in which they are located and with the provisions of this uses shall be subject to the standards in this subsection b  expansion and enlargement 1 except in accordance with this subsection a nonconforming use shall not be extended enlarged expanded moved to occupy a different area or intensified an existing nonconforming use may extend into any portion of a structure that was clearly designed or arranged for such use alone when the use became nonconforming 2 the following shall be considered as extensions of the use of a structure a attachment of signs to the structure  b placement of signs or display materials on land outside the structure  and c attachment of racks balconies or other projections from the structure 3 no nonconforming use shall be extended to displace a conforming use c  structures used for nonconforming use 1 a structure used for a nonconforming use shall not be reconstructed restored rebuilt structurally altered or repaired during its life to an extent whereby the cumulative cost of the reconstruction restoration rebuilding structural alteration or repair equals or exceeds 50 percent of the structures market value unless the structure is thereafter used only for a conforming use 2 if a structure used for a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by any means it shall not be reconstructed restored rebuilt structurally altered or repaired for continued use for the nonconforming use except in accordance with the requirements of e reconstruction or restoration after damage d  replacement of nonconforming mobile homes and manufactured homes an existing lawfullyestablished nonconforming mobile home may be replaced by a class a manufactured home or a class b manufactured home a class b manufactured home may be replaced by a class a manufactured home or another class b manufactured home provided the replacement manufactured home has a newer construction date than the class b manufactured home being replaced e  change in use if no structural alterations are made a nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or more restrictive use category as identified in the use tables in b and 2341c once a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use no structure or land shall be allowed to revert to a nonconforming use f  discontinuance of use 1 if a nonconforming use ceases to operate or has been discontinued for a period of one year or longer it shall not be reestablished and shall only be replaced with a conforming use 2 time spent renovating or repairing a structure devoted to the nonconforming use is not considered a discontinuance of the use provided a all appropriate development approvals are obtained  b the renovation or repair is completed within 18 months after commencement of the repair or renovation  and c the use is reestablished within 30 days after completion of the renovation or repairs 3 once a nonconforming principal use is discontinued all associated accessory uses shall cease operations within 30 days g  exceptions 1 policy certain public quasipublic semipublic and institutional uses currently exist as nonconforming uses in the city there are also specific areas within the city in which redevelopment will be encouraged because of the substantial investment in such uses the public interest in the maintenance of such uses as modern and functional facilities the lack of vacant land for the relocation of such uses in the developed portions of the city and the enormous public and private cost involved in relocating such uses the city council finds it is in the public interest to provide limited exceptions for these facilities from the standards of this article 2 existing public and semipublic facilities existing public and governmental uses schools colleges universities and golf courses may continue to be operated and maintained in any residential or commercial district and may be expanded if such expansion can be accomplished in accordance with the applicable zoning district regulations no new such facility may be established except where permitted in the applicable zoning district 3 existing cemeteries and mausoleums existing cemeteries and mausoleums and their accessory structures and appurtenances may be maintained structurally altered enlarged or extended within the existing boundaries of such cemeteries or mausoleums subject to a conditional use permit approved in accordance with d conditional use permit 4

in accordance with d conditional use permit if found to be consistent with the goals of the biloxi comprehensive plan and the redevelopment plan for the specific redevelopment area 3  nonconforming structures a  relationship with nonconforming uses a nonconforming principal structure containing a conforming use may only continue in accordance with the provisions of this subsection nonconforming structures housing a nonconforming use may only continue in accordance with the standards in nonconforming uses b  enlargement or expansion a nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged or expanded in any way that increases the nonconformity for example a structure that has a side yard setback of five feet where the a minimum side yard setback of ten feet cannot be enlarged so as to further encroach into the side yard setback expansion of the structure in a way that complies with applicable dimensional standards or that decreases the degree of nonconformity is permitted c  relocation a nonconforming structure shall not be moved in whole or in part to another location on or off the parcel of land on which it is located unless the entire structure thereafter conforms to the requirements of this d  maintenance repairs and remodeling 1 maintenance and repairs of a nonconforming structure shall not equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure 2 remodeling of a nonconforming structure within the existing building footprint is permitted provided that the remodeling does not increase the degree of nonconformity and that applicable building and life safety codes are met e  reconstruction or restoration after damage 1 damage up to 50 percent of value if a nonconforming structure is damaged by any means to an extent whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its beforedamaged condition would be less than 50 percent of its market value before the damage occurred the structure may be reconstructed restored rebuilt structurally altered or repaired if a the reconstruction restoration rebuilding structural alteration or repair does not increase expand enlarge or extend the degree of nonconformity  b a building permit authorizing the reconstruction restoration rebuilding structural alteration or repair is obtained within six months after the damage  and c the reconstruction restoration rebuilding structural alteration or repair is completed in accordance with approved plans within one year after the damage 2 damage of 50 percent or more of value if a nonconforming structure is damaged by any means to an extent whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its beforedamaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of its market value before the damage occurred the structure shall not be reconstructed restored rebuilt structurally altered or repaired except in conformity with the provisions of this f  exceptions 1 policy those areas of biloxi most vulnerable to storms and flooding contain many nonconforming structures that are important to maintaining the character of the city and its neighborhoods to maintain that character yet reduce vulnerability to storm and flood damage this subsection relaxes limitations on the enlargement expansion relocation remodeling reconstruction restoration rebuilding structural alteration or repair of nonconforming structures located within floodplains where hazard resiliency measures are incorporated and compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood is maintained 2 nonconforming structures in floodplains existing nonconforming structures located within an area of special flood hazardas designated on flood insurance rate maps adopted as part of flood damage prevention of the biloxi ordinancesmay be enlarged expanded remodeled relocated elsewhere in an

elevation  3 converting enclosed areas of the structure below the base flood elevation to nonhabitable space  4 wet floodproofing enclosed areas of the structure below the base flood elevation to allow flood waters to temporarily fill the areas to equalize hydrostatic loads and prevent buoyancy including the elevation or floodproofing of hvac equipment and electrical system components  5 installing permanent storm shutters on glass windows and doors or replacement of glass windows and doors with shatterproof glass  6 installing flood openings in foundations and enclosed areas of the structure below the base flood elevation to allow flood waters to pass equalize hydrostatic loads and prevent buoyancy  or 7 securing shingle builtup and metal roofs against high wind damage b the

continued enlarged extended reconstructed or structurally altered in any way that is in conformance with the standards of this 2 nonconforming structures legally established on a nonconforming lot before  may be continued enlarged or redeveloped only in accordance with the standards in nonconforming structures c  development of nonconforming limitations imposed by other provisions of this a nonconforming lot that fails to comply with applicable dimensional standards eg area width depth may be used for a use permitted in the zoning district in which the lot is located development of the permitted use on the nonconforming lot shall comply with the other intensity and dimensional standards of the district to the maximum extent practicable d  reconstruction of dwellings on nonconforming residential districts after damage if a legally established singlefamily attached or detached dwelling use on a nonconforming lot in a residential zoning district is damaged to an extent whereby the

footprint as the damaged or destroyed dwelling even though the lot does not meet applicable dimensional standards e  rearrangement of property lines required if a vacant nonconforming lot is located adjacent to another lot whether conforming or nonconforming held in the same ownership and the adjacent lot has sufficient size to allow for a rearrangement of property line see f2b exempt subdivision as a means of bringing the vacant lot closer into conformity with the requirements of the zoning district where it is located then such rearrangement of property lines shall be required as a condition of approval for development on the vacant nonconforming lot f  governmental acquisition of land in a residential district governmental acquisition of a portion of a lot for a public purpose that results in a reduction in lot width andor lot area below that required shall not render the lot nonconforming g  change of nonconforming lot a nonconforming lot may be increased in area width or both rearrangement of property lines in accordance with the requirements of f2b exempt subdivision provided the rearrangement of property lines does not increase the lots nonconformity 5  nonconforming signs a  maintenance a nonconforming sign may be maintained but shall not be enlarged structurally altered or relocated in any way that makes the sign more nonconforming b  reconstruction or restoration after damage if a nonconforming sign is damaged by any means to an extent whereby the cost of storing the sign to its beforedamaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of its replacement value before the damage occurred the sign shall not be reconstructed restored rebuilt structurally altered or repaired except in conformity with the provisions of this c  abandoned

structures in nonconforming structures 6  nonconforming site features a  purpose the purpose of this section is provide a means whereby the city may require certain nonconforming site features to be brought into compliance with the standards of this part of remodeling or expansion of a structure b  applicability 1 for purposes of this section the term nonconforming site features includes the following a nonconforming offstreet parking  b nonconforming landscaping  c nonconforming screening of mechanical equipment  d nonconforming perimeter buffers  and e nonconforming screening of walls or fences 2 if an application is filed for a building permit for the remodeling or expansion of a structure and the development site contains one or more nonconforming site features identified in b1 above and the value of the proposed improvements totals at least 25 percent of the current fair market or assessed value of the existing structure the applicant shall be required to address the nonconforming site feature as provided in this section 3 the director of community development may develop administrative guidelines to assist in the implementation of this section including guidelines for the resolution of conflicts when it may not be possible for one or more types of nonconforming site features to be brought into compliance with the requirements of this of particular site constraints or impacts on adjacent properties c  interior and exterior remodeling of structures 1 remodeling costing 25 percent or less of structure value remodeling of a structure in any continuous 12month period that costs 25 percent or less of the current fair market or assessed value of the structure at the option of the applicant shall not require any upgrading of the nonconforming site features identified in b1 2 remodeling costing between 25 and 75 percent of structure value remodeling of a structure in any continuous 12month period that costs more than 25 percent but less than 75 percent of the current fair market or assessed value of the structure at the option of the applicant shall require nonconforming site features identified in b1 to be upgraded towards compliance with the standards of this a corresponding percentage of full compliance up to achievement of 100 percent compliance example an existing building that requires 40 offstreet parking spaces but only has 20 spaces is remodeled such that the cost of remodeling equals 30 percent of the buildings value the remodeling project must add 12 parking spaces 30%  40 increasing the degree of compliance from 50 percent to 80 percent a subsequent remodeling whose cost also equals 30 percent of building value might seem to call for the addition of another 12 spaces 30%  40 but actually only 8 new spaces would be required to achieve 100% compliance 3 remodeling costing 75 percent or more of structure value remodeling of a structure in any continuous 12month period that costs 75 percent or more of the current fair market or assessed value of the structure at the option of the applicant shall require all nonconforming site features identified in b1 to be upgraded to achieve 100 percent compliance with the standards of this 4 when two of fewer parking spaces required when this subsection calls for a remodeling project to install two or fewer additional offstreet parking spaces such additional offstreet parking is not required to be installed 5 determination of building cost and structure value for purposes of determining if upgrading of nonconforming site features is required by this subsection the cost of the remodeling shall be as shown on the approved building permit application fair market value shall be based on a market appraisal performed by a certified appraiser at the applicants expense assessed value shall be based on the most recently available harrison county tax rolls d  additions and expansions 1 additions and expansion less than 15 percent additions or expansions to a structure or use area in any continuous fiveyear period that increase the gross square footage of the structure or use area measured at the beginning of the fiveyear period by 15 percent or less shall not require any upgrading of the nonconforming site features identified in b1 2 additions and expansions between 15 and 50 percent additions or expansions to a structure or use area in any continuous fiveyear period that increase the gross square footage of the structure or use area measured at the beginning of the fiveyear period by more than 15 percent but less than 50 percent shall require nonconforming site features identified in b1 to be installed or upgraded towards compliance with the standards of this a corresponding percentage of full compliance up to achievement of 100 percent compliance example an existing building in a development that requires 40 caliper inches of canopy trees but only contains 20 caliper inches is expanded by 30 percent of the developments gross floor area the expansion project must add 12 caliper inches of canopy trees 30%  40 increasing compliance from 50 percent to 80 percent a subsequent addition whose size also equals 30 percent of existing building size might seem to call for addition of another 12 caliper inches of canopy trees 30%  40 but actually only eight new caliper inches would be required to achieve 100% compliance 3 additions and expansions greater than 50 percent additions or expansions to a structure or use area in any continuous fiveyear period that increase the gross square footage of the structure or use area measured at the beginning of the fiveyear period by more than 50 percent shall require all nonconforming site features identified in b1 to be installed or upgraded to achieve 100 percent compliance with the standards of this 4 additions and expansions of outdoor use areas only when only outdoor operations storage and display areas are being added or expanded on a site the percentage increase in the gross square footage of the outdoor operations storage and display areas shall require perimeter buffers and screening to be installed or upgraded towards compliance with the standards of this a corresponding percentage of full compliance the increased perimeter buffer and screening shall be located so as to achieve the performance objectives in landscaping with priority given to screening the impacts of outdoor operations e  compliance to maximum extent practicable on constrained properties where full compliance with the requirements of this section is precluded by physical constraints on development the applicant shall comply with the requirements of this section to the maximum extent practicable as determined by the director of community
