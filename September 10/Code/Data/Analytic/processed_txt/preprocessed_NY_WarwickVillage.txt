to establish minimum requirements for the control of stormwater soil erosion and sedimentation of surface waters to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the residents and to address the following findings 1 land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition 2 this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species 3 clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat 4 improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation 5 impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow 6 substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the village 7 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities 8 the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source village of warwick zoning law  102 pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety 9 regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development b purposes establishing minimum stormwater management requirements and controls will address the findings of fact cited above by achieving the following purposes 1 require land development activities to conform to the substantive requirements of the new york state department of environmental conservation state pollutant discharge elimination system spdes general permit for construction activities gp0201 or as amended or revised  2 minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development activities in order to reduce flooding siltation increases in stream temperature and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels  3 minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land development activities which would otherwise degrade local water quality  4 minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to the maximum extent practicable  and 5 reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution wherever possible management practices and to ensure that these management practices are properly maintained and eliminate threats to public safety 6 the goal of new york states stormwater management program is to retain or absorb stormwater on the developed site with the quantity rate and quality of runoff remaining the same as the predevelopment condition the village of warwicks goal is to exceed this goal by 10% for rate so that extra capacity is designed in the stormwater management facilities to accommodate minor changes in the impervious cover which frequently occur overtime and after development approvals have been received c applicability
