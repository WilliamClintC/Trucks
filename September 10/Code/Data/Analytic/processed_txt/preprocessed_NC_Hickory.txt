protection which are located in the public rightofway a plan of correction shall be developed in accordance to monies available 2 where existing development poses a danger to life and property due to fire hydrant deficiencies existing on private property the fire department may require the deficiency to be corrected the cost of this type of fire hydrant protection shall be borne by the owner amend no 2 9491 required fire flow tables a generally 1 the following tables shall be used to determine the minimum fire flow requirements needed for a building the fireflow requirement is the quantity of water in gallons per minute needed to control an anticipated fire in a building or group of buildings fire flows determined from these tables shall be required to be available for a duration of at least 60 minutes with a minimum of 20 psi residual pressure available this will assure of sufficient flow for fire protection while allowing other water users in the area to maintain a normal usage without any interruption or damage to the users system 2 these fire flow requirements may be modified by the fire official of the fire department to allow for exposure problems of adjacent buildings storage of hazardous materials occupancy classification or any other such condition that may warrant an increase in fire flow to provide adequate fire protection b definition to define fire area this is the total floor area in square feet for all floor levels within the exterior walls or under the horizontal projection of the roof of a building fourhour fire separation walls may be considered in dividing a building into separate fire areas for the purpose of determining fire flow c notes to tables 1 the minimum fireflow requirements for one and twofamily dwellings shall be 1000 gpm exception this requirement may be reduced 50 percent if the building is equipped with an approved sprinkler system 2 the minimum fire flow requirement determined by the following tables for buildings other than one or twofamily dwellings may be reduced 50 percent if the building is equipped with an approved sprinkler system however the flow requirement shall not be reduced below the requirements of the sprinkler system as determined per nfpa 13 3 multistory buildings may have modifications to the fire flow the fire official of the fire department shall assist in these determinations 4 hydrants installed to meet the provisions of the fire flow requirements shall be calculated at providing 1500 gpm each if the required fire flow does not exceed the hydrant flow calculation by 500 gpm or more then an additional hydrant shall not be required see table 5 5 additional hydrants may be necessary for the adequate fire protection of a building above the minimum calculated by table 5 due to the accessibility of fire apparatus extended hose lays or other such situations that may dictate fire department procedures the fire official of the fire department will be able to help the developer in making these determinations in no case shall the spacing distance of hydrants that are installed under the provisions of this policy be more than is allowed under these guidelines d conversion chart

uniformsized pentagonal operating nut measuring 112 inches from point to flat at the base with 1 716 inches at the top b the diameter of the bottom of the valve shall not be less than six inches to provide no more than three psifriction loss at a flow of 250 gpm single 212inch outlet c hydrants shall be installed at a readily accessible location hydrants shall be installed so that the 412inch discharge is at least 18 inches above finished grade this clearance is necessary to facilitate a hydrant assistvalve when connecting to the hydrant d upon completion of installation each hydrant shall be flushed of all sediment or debris that may hinder its operation the caps will then be greased and the hydrant set ready for service the fire department will then be notified of the completion of the installation and that the hydrant is in service and ready for an inspection by the fire official e all completed hydrant installations shall be inspected by the fire official in order to be sure that the hydrant is in compliance with this policy f all new installations shall be warranted by the installer for the period of one year for material or installation defects g once the hydrant has met approval of proper installation by the fire marshal then it will become the responsibility of the city to maintain the hydrant if the hydrant is located on public rightofway the city will take care of any expense in maintaining and repairing any defects or malfunctions with the hydrant other than those that are covered under the warranty of the installer all hydrants installed on private property shall be maintained by the owner or occupant h all new hydrants shall be painted to match the existing hydrants in the city unless otherwise specified this color shall be yellow barrel  white reflective caps and bonnet i materials used and installation methods shall meet the standards of the city public utilities department in compliance with the ansi and awwa standards 2 hydrant spacing a hydrants shall be located as close as possible to street intersections or areas of direct vehicular access recommended hydrant spacing for developed areas will be 500 feet at no time will hydrant spacing exceed 800 feet larger industrial commercial or multifamily developments may require additional hydrants to compensate for long hose lays andor greater water demand these determinations shall be made by the fire official at the time of the plans review or at the subdivision review board meeting b hydrants shall be located no closer than 50 feet from a building if a probable collapse zone exists due to the height of the building that provides a greater distance than 50 feet then the hydrant shall be located out of this zone c hydrants should be located close to street access as to facilitate easy hookup d hydrants located in areas designated for parking shall be afforded some type of protection from collision of vehicular traffic exception side street parking where a curb protects the hydrant from normal parking and is marked for no parking  no other type of protection is needed e for parking on a street beside a hydrant at least one parking space shall be marked at the hydrant to provide for no parking in shopping centers or other type parking areas at least one parking space in front andor back for whichever provides the means of access shall be designated as for fire department access the area around the hydrant shall be marked with yellow markings and designate in letters no parking f hydrants shall be located at least four feet from any solid object such as a power pole tree building dumpster etc that may hinder access and use of the hydrant brush andor trees shall be cleared around the hydrant to at least four feet in all directions a clear area of access shall be maintained to the hydrant at all times amend no 2 9491 water supply lines for hydrants the following are the guidelines in the installation of piping for supply of water to a hydrant 1 hydrants installed on existing water lines will need to have a flow test conducted by the fire marshals office to insure that the existing line can supply an adequate flow of water as needed per iso fire flow requirements 2 all supply line piping and fittings shall be suitable for the working pressures and conditions under which the pipe is installed types of piping and fittings used shall meet the standards set forth by the city public utilities department and in conjunction with ansi and awwa standards the installation methods shall also meet these standards recommended practices of materials used and installation are covered under the fire protection handbook of the national fire protection association 3 a new supply line installation that ties both ends of the new piping into the feeder mains so as to be fed from two directions shall be considered a loop system the minimum size piping installed for a loop system shall be six inches any supply line that supplies more than four hydrants shall be installed as a loop system unless the piping is oversized to overcome the friction loss in order to provide the prescribed fire flow any supply line supplying less than four hydrants but extends more than 2500 feet shall also be installed as a loop system unless the piping is oversized to provide the prescribed fire flow 4 a new supply line installation that only ties one end into a feeder main so that it receives a supply of water from one direction shall be considered a dead end main 5 dead end mains shall be a minimum size of eightinch piping if the dead end main extends for more than 2500 feet with a required fire flow of 750 gpm or more then a larger size pipe shall be installed to overcome the friction loss that may reduce the available flow it shall be the responsibility of the installer to contact the fire marshals office to determine the minimum size necessary in this situation 6 valves for the isolation of hydrants andor branch or feeder supply lines shall be as a good practice as per the city public utility department requires a recommended practice of installation is in accordance with the publication nfpa #26 7 it shall be the responsibility of the developer property owner or person in charge of the development project to submit plans of construction of the water supply lines or hydrant location and spacing to the fire marshals office and utilities department for approval prior to installation all new supply lines shall be inspected prior to their covering of fill material to insure compliance with the submitted plans once the system is completed a final inspection will be conducted this inspection will also include a flow test to insure proper fire flow adequacy 8 all new installed supply lines shall be warranted by the installer for a period of one year for material andor installation defects this is commensurate with the installation of new hydrants once the line has met approval of proper installation by the fire marshal then it will be the responsibility of the city to maintain those lines which are located on the public rightofway supply lines installed on private property shall be maintained at the expense of the owner defects covered under the installers warranty shall be corrected by the installer amend no 2 9491 garbage refuse and weeds footnotes  1  editors note amend no 5

thenapplicable requirements to continue to exist and be put to productive use but to bring as many aspects of such situations into compliance with existing regulations as is reasonably possible this article establishes regulations governing uses structures and lots that were lawfully established but that do not conform to one or more requirements of this land development a situation that did not constitute a lawful nonconforming situation under the previously adopted zoning ordinance does not achieve lawful nonconforming status under this chapter merely by the repeal of the prior ordinance or regulation c the regulations are further intended to 1 recognize the interests of property owners in continuing to use their property  2 promote reuse and rehabilitation of existing buildings  and 3
