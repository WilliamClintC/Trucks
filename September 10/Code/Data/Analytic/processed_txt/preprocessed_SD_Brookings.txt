undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard to minimize future flood blight areas  7 ensure that potential buyers of property are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to life health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses are protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  4 controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas  lands to which this article applies this chapter applies to all areas of special flood hazard within the city and its joint jurisdictional area  compliance with article provisions structures and land which are constructed located extended or altered must comply with the regulations provided in this article  basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard the areas of special flood hazard are identified by the federal emergency management agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled the flood insurance study for brookings county south dakota and incorporated areas dated  with the accompanying flood insurance rate maps firm
