finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has asignificant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the communityand diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled erosionand postconstruction runoff can degrade physical stream lake and river habitat by increasing bank erosion increasingstreambed lake bed and riverbed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing streambase flows and increasing water temperatures diminish the capacity of lakes streams and rivers to support fish aquatic life and recreationaland water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrientsheavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm
