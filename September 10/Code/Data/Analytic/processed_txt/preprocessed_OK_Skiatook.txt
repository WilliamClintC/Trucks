detention site locations shall be shown on the preliminary plat to illustrate how these areas will be managed during and after construction the year frequency rainstorm floodplain is defined as the area of land that the runoff from the 100year frequency rainstorm inundates 8 detention facilities should be located in areas that require a minimum of maintenance 9 detention facilities may be located in the floodplain area or flood hazard area provided the floodplain area and the flood hazard area are determined with the facility in place and that no rise in the water surface off site of the development results from the installation of the facility except that permitted by city ordinance 10 additional detention storage in excess of the required storage for a drainage area can be provided to satisfy the detention requirements for a tract of land downstream of the detention facility provided the detention facility is constructed prior to the development of the downstream tract 11 all detention facilities shall be designed dry unless a special maintenance agreement in writing has been approved by the city 12 a minimum number of detention facilities is encouraged for each development 13 if runoff has a natural tendency to drain in several directions for a given development tract of land where detention is required then detention storage shall be provided for the biggest drainage area additionally detention storage may be provided at the same facility to satisfy detention requirements for a separate drainage area on the same development  provided that a the whole developmental tract of land is in the same watershed b the smaller drainage area that has been compensated for does not either singly or in combination adversely impact the health welfare and safety of the general public downstream 14 if a tract of land being developed is located in more than one drainage area then grading work to divert flows from one drainage area to another will not be permitted compensatory storage will not be permitted in one drainage area for that required in another a drainage area is defined as an area of land that funnels stormwater runoff to a common point at the downhill side of that tract being developed 15 detention facilities may be used for compensatory storage when encroaching into the floodplain area  provided that the overall drainage system does not a cause a rise in the water surface elevation beyond the extent of the developmental tract of land b adversely impact adjacent properties by an increase in velocity 16 all dikes and spillways on detention facilities shall have typical cross sections shown on the plans  sterling codifiers inc  268269 17 side slopes on detention facilities shall not be steeper than four to one  horizontalvertical steeper side slope may be allowed should the site conditions necessitate  however methods for proper erosion control must be established and illustrated and the procedures for maintaining these steeper side slopes must be established and shown on the plan 18 detention facilities shall be provided with a low flow channel from the inlet to the outlet structure to transmit low flows and the low flow channel shall be approved by the city the low flow channel shall be concrete lined and of sufficient width and geometry to allow for proper maintenance the maintenance procedure

frequency rainfall event that flows out of the drainage easement if there is no drainage easement covering the watercourse then a problem is when the runoff flows out of its channel banks in developed areas in undeveloped areas without a drainage easement a problem is when the runoff flows out of its channel banks and overtops roads andor impacts structures major development any development that is

feet per building lot unless better information is available an impervious surface shall include all surfaces that do not allow an appreciable amount of infiltration this includes but is not limited to roads driveways roofs and parking lots both paved and graveled minor development a development that is less than a major development on site detention facility a stormwater detention facility built

capacity for all new development in a defined drainage area 2 regional detention facility in place or planned when there is a regional detention facility in place in the drainage area where development is planned or one is planned in the near future then all new development may incorporate the regional detention facility into the design of the drainage system for the development 3 no regional detention facility when there is no regional detention facility constructed or planned in the near future for a particular drainage area where development is planned then the following shall apply a when there is an existing drainage problem downstream of the development then new major development is required to provide on site detention the method of maintenance shall be set forth in the deed restrictions the only exception to on site detention is new construction of a singlefamily home on an existing lot tract or parcel that has not complied with the storm drainage detention requirements of this chapter b when there is no drainage problem downstream of the development then new development shall build on site detention facilities unless the developer can show that the development will not produce a problem downstream 4 maintenance responsibility a the property owners in the development shall be responsible for maintenance to its detention facility in a minor residential commercial or industrial development if the detention facility is privately maintained then the maintenance requirements shall be set forth in the deed restriction and the city shall be party to these deed restrictions  b the city shall not be responsible for the maintenance of detention facilities in major residential developments  1278 soil erosion and sedimentation control
