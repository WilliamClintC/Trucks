article as amended by #200622 aug 2006  rooming houses a purpose and intent the residential zoning districts are established with the intention that a dwelling unit would be occupied by a single family or household occupancy of a dwelling unit by several unrelated individuals can negatively impact the quality of the residential environment for other dwelling units in the neighborhood traffic parking demand noise litter property that is poorly maintained etc these problems can arise since the unrelated occupants may lack a shared since of common household responsibility toward the general upkeep of the property and the owners of such property may be induced to minimize maintenance investment where occupancy is somewhat transitory and the expectations of the occupants regarding property conditions are relatively low likewise the unrelated occupants may lack the personal interest in neighborhood environmental quality held by those whose concerns for such quality extend beyond themselves to fellow members of their households such occupancy of a dwelling unit by several unrelated individuals is the primary characteristic of a rooming house as hereinafter defined this

proposed development that has an intensity of l must provide a type a or type b buffer when locating next to property that is v the other cases represented in the table below are of proposed development areas that are more intensive than the adjacent areas and therefore have to provide a buffer 4 proposed residential uses with an intensity of n or l when developed adjacent to a highway require a buffer between the proposed residential use and the highway as described herein residential development with an intensity of n shall provide a type a or type b buffer along its borders with principal arterial streets interstate highways and other freeways residential development with an intensity of l shall provide a type a or type b buffer along its borders with interstate highways and

such a situation the director may allow the landscape buffer to be modified to the extent necessary to address the problem after considering the effects of the required buffer on the public interest in comparison to a proposed modification to the buffer the analysis made by the director would include documentation of the impact of the buffer consideration of any known alternatives that would be mitigate the impact of the required landscape buffer while preserving the benefits it is intended to provide and consideration of comments from property owners whose interests would otherwise be

location and screening of noisy or unsightly activities as amended by #201402 feb 2014 appc98 c tree preservation it is the purpose and intent of this section of the zoning regulations to promote the preservation of trees on private property or the replacement of such trees where preservation is ineffective in order to improve the quality of development and to provide environmental and aesthetic benefits and to buffer or otherwise mitigate the affects of urbanization on any tract lot or parcel of land or portion thereof lying in the city of cleveland tennessee that is 1 acre or more in size or on any such tract lot or parcel less than 1 acre that contains no building with a tax appraisal of $25000 or more it shall be unlawful and a zoning violation in any zoning district to remove any trees with a trunk diameter greater than 6 inches or any trees designated for preservation in an approved tree removal replacement and preservation plan trrpp except in compliance with the following requirements trees that are dead that are severely diseased or severely and unintentionally damaged or that are in a utility easement or rightofway or that are physically damaging or endangering existing structures utilities transportation or communication systems eg root damage to pipes or the blocking of satellite reception and the likethese are subject to coverage by a general city of cleveland permit but the owner of any tree or trees removed pursuant to these exceptions is responsible to maintain specific documentation of the existence of such exception conditions in order to sustain coverage by the aforementioned general permit 1 a tree removal permit is obtained from the department of community development based upon a tree removal replacement and preservation plan trrpp approved by the urban forester a tree removal permit would not authorize grading of a site or any other land disturbing activity requiring a land disturbance permit under the citys stormwater ordinance but it would authorize tree removal in conjunction with these activities once they are properly permitted a tree removal permit would authorize tree removal by cutting in the absence of a land disturbing activity a tree removal permit would authorize only such tree removal as is consistent with the approved trrpp removing or endangering failing to follow the urban foresters guidelines for preserving trees trees that are to be preserved under the trrpp would be a violation of the tree removal permit appc99 2 the trrpp is to include the general location of forested areas on the site and available aerial photography the trrpp is to identify general areas on the site within 50 feet of property lines where tree preservation could occur where the required tree preservation is not feasible within 50 feet of property lines alternative areas of the site may be designated the trrpp is to identify how any trees and their associated understory will be preserved on the site predevelopment during development and postdevelopment consistent with guidelines provided by the urban forester the trrpp should result in a practical and sustainable preservation of trees that will provide benefits to the development and the community consistent with the purpose and intent of this ordinance trees that are preserved should be incorporated into any required buffering for the site or into site landscaping and trees that are preserved are intended to be counted toward the fulfillment of any requirements for buffering if in the buffer area or landscaping shielding of residential areas from roadways and other uses is an important consideration preserving of the largest tree or trees is not necessarily paramount but consideration should be given to size species characteristics potential positive and negative impacts of the particular trees in their location in light of the development plan and long term survival of the trees the trrpp is to achieve a target of preserving 10 trees with a trunk diameter of 6 inches per acre or a canopy coverage from trees with a 6 inch trunk diameter that is equal to 10% of the site acreage trees preserved are to be from species approved by the urban forester and are to consist of at least 50% shade trees by number of trees or percentage of canopy the trrpp is to identify the location species common name and diameter at breast height dbh of the tree to be preserved and this same information is to be provided for any tree that exceeds 20 inches dbh not to exceed 20 trees per site priorities for inclusion are the largest trees hardwood shade trees not otherwise listed among the exceptions for preservation and trees within 50 feet of a property line where a large tree of 20 inches or more dbh is included in the trrpp to be preserved it will count as two trees if the required minimum is to be met by preserving 10 trees per acre 3 the trrpp is a part of and a condition of any tree removal permit site plan approval land disturbance permit andor building permit issued for development on the site the property owner is responsible to maintain the property perpetually in compliance with the approved trrpp modifications to the plan that are necessitated by the final site design are to be approved by the urban forester in the event that a preserved tree in the trrpp dies or must be removed for some other reason the urban forester may approve a modification to the appc100 trrpp that includes replacement of the tree replacement will be with one or two trees that have a minimum combined dbh of at least 6 inches at the time of planting the trrpp is to be submitted to and approved by the urban forester prior to the issuance of a tree removal permit a trrpp review fee of twentyfive dollars shall be submitted with each trrpp and with each trrpp revision that is initiated by the property owner on any tract lot or parcel of land or portion thereof lying in the city of cleveland tennessee that is less than 1 acre and that contains a building with a tax appraisal of $25000 or more it shall be unlawful and a zoning violation in any zoning district to remove any trees with a trunk diameter greater than 28 inches diameter at breast height dbh without a limited tree removal permit approved by the urban forester trees that are dead that are severely diseased or severely and unintentionally damaged or that are in a utility easement or rightofway or that are physically damaging or endangering existing structures utilities transportation or communication systems eg root damage to pipes or the blocking of satellite reception and the likethese are subject to coverage by a general city of cleveland permit but the owner of any tree or trees removed pursuant to these exceptions is responsible to maintain specific documentation of the existence of such exception conditions in order to sustain coverage by the aforementioned general permit if there would be fewer than five trees of 6 inches or more dbh remaining on the site after the removal of the trees that are the subject of the limited tree removal permit then each tree removed shall be replaced by a shade tree from the urban foresters approved list the replacement shall be onsite or if approved on appeal to the urban forester on a public property or alternative site protected by a conservation easement the total number of trees removed pursuant to one or more limited tree removal permits on a given property shall not exceed four the limited tree removal permit fee of ten dollars shall be submitted prior to approval of the permit as

restrictions etc 4 effect of approving pud conceptual plan in no way would such approval by the planning commission exempt any eventual development from compliance with site plan appc137 building permit soil erosion and flood protection requirements nor would it obligate the city of cleveland to construct any public improvements in support of the proposed development such approval does not change the underlying zoning of the property affected or otherwise place additional development rights or restrictions on the property such approval does not alter the rights of any owners or tenants of affected property as these may pertain to the use sale or subdivision of the property such approval does not authorize the eminent domain purchase of property by the city of cleveland such approval

approval of a pud final plan planning commission and the city council approval of the pud conceptual plan does result in an informational resource that may be used by city council in planning budgeting and constructing public improvements or in carrying out other planning activities the pud conceptual plan approval shall be in effect for a period of five 5 years after planning commission approval after which time it shall automatically sunset unless continued by the planning commission b pud development plan process 1 content and effect of the pud development plan the pud development plan is the means by which new zoning and other land development controls are enacted for an area where a pud conceptual plan has been approved the ordinance implementing the pud will constitute the zoning classification of the area affected by the pud the pud development plan may also encompass a subdivision of land and commitments by the owners and developers to construct various public infrastructure improvements the pud development plan is to be a recorded legal instrument adopted by ordinance of the city council and binding upon the property owners developers heirs and assigns the pud development plan will include information describing appc138 the permitted uses buffering and screening requirements building setbacks any necessary performance related standards noise lighting hours of operation etc any necessary monitoring and reporting requirements landscape maintenance litter control stormwater treatment maintenance etc any necessary phasing schedule any necessary public improvements to be installed by the developer an acknowledgment that the owner is responsible to obtain and comply with all applicable federal state and local permits and an expiration date after which the pud development plan may expire the pud development plan would also include a master site plan and subdivision plan if applicable with all of the normal requirements for site plans and plats except as altered by the pud an approved pud development plan does not constitute a reservation of public facility or infrastructure capacity 2 pud expiration phasing deviations and amendments a pud development plan may be allowed to expire after the expiration date if city council determines that substantial progress has not been made or is unlikely to be made and that the public interest would be better served by reverting to the previous zoning prior to a city council determination regarding such expiration the matter is to be reviewed by the planning commission following the procedures for a rezoning an existing pud would not expire without an ordinance to that effect and city council may extend the stated expiration date of a pud by amending the ordinance the pud development plan maybe structured in one or more phases with appropriate engineering architectural and other drawings and documents to be submitted at the appropriate time before the construction of each phase however the pud development plan shall control future phases and any substantial deviations will require amending the pud development plan ordinance proposed changes in permitted uses proposed decreases in approved setbacks by more than twenty percent 20% proposed increases in approved building heights by more than twenty percent 20%significant relocation or redesign of proposed public rightsofway significant stormwater management changes and changes deemed to be substantial deviations by the planning commission will require an amendment to the appc139 pud development plan to be approved by the city council after a review and recommendation by the planning commission changes to the pud development plan that are not substantial deviations can be approved by the planning commission the pud development plan shall be advertised posted and heard by the planning commission and the city council in the same manner as are zoning and any amendment to an approved pud development plan shall be

area in the area bounded by inman street to the north apd40 to the south wildwood avenue and dalton pike to the east and ocoee street and blue springs road to the west there are areas of singlefamily residential development that are zoned for industrial use this was done when cleveland had a pyramid zoning structure that allowed residential development in industrial zones but this is no longer the case so these homes have become nonconforming uses decades of economic and technological change together with relocation of nearby industry indicate the need for redevelopment within this area including new and rehabilitated housing industrially zoned residential sites that have long been in residential use especially where these are clustered and not located adjacent to the railroad arterial streets or truck routes can be important areas for reinvestment in housing that will support areawide redevelopment and assist current residents in staying in the area should they so choose as well as new residents who may wish to move into the area therefore where the cleveland municipal planning commission has determined that an industrially zoned oneor twofamily dwelling meets the locational criteria described in this paragraph and that the aforesaid dwelling has received substantial recent upgrades or repairs the planning commission will issue a written determination that the dwelling can be rebuilt if damaged beyond 50% of its appraised value paragraph  notwithstanding in order to obtain such a determination from the planning commission it is the responsibility of the owner to make the request in writing and to supply all necessary documentation of recent appc149 upgrades and repairs as amended by #201338 aug 201 and #201404 feb 2014 48 yard parking overlay based upon a petition from property owners within a defined neighborhood area and the advice of the cleveland municipal planning commission the city council may amend the official zoning map following proper procedures for such an amendment to apply the yard parking overlay district described herein it is the intent of this district to protect the public welfare by mitigating the effects of heavy parking use in historically singlefamily neighborhoods by controlling parking in streetside yard areas and limiting the conversion of yard areas into gravel or hard surface parking areas so as to protect neighborhood aesthetics and environmental quality a vehicle parking in front or side yard areas of a lot or parcel lying between a singlefamily residential structure and a property line that adjoins a public rightofway shall be limited to the area of the hardsurface or gravel driveway unless such parking occurs within a garage or under a carport vehicle parking in side yards not adjoining public rightsofway or in rear yards shall be screened by means of a hedge or privacy fence nothing herein shall be construed as allowing the location of a garage or carport or fence except where otherwise allowed by the zoning ordinance b hardsurface or gravel driveway or parking areas shall not be constructed such that these cause the lot or parcel to be in violation appc150 of the zoning ordinance requirements related to impervious or pervious surfaces or green space c the total of hardsurface or gravel driveway or parking areas on the lot or parcel with a singlefamily home shall not exceed 15% of the lot area excluding any area in the flag stem of a flag stem lot and any area underneath the roof of a permanently constructed garage or carport the area of the house excluding the garage or carport shall not be counted toward the 15% of the lot area for purposes of this paragraph as added by #200812 april 2008 appc151 50 sign regulations 51 purpose and intent of the sign regulations the purpose and intent of these regulations is to provide for the public health safety convenience and general welfare regulation of signs within the city of cleveland tennessee among the specific intentions are to limit visibility hazards along and adjacent to roadways to protect utilities and drainage structures from encroachment and damage from sign installation to protect the community and its roadway corridors from visual clutter and to protect the community and its environment from discarded damaged or improperly installed signs it is not the purpose of these sign regulations to regulate speech 52 sign standards presents general standards for all signs and standards for specific types of signs under various circumstances these general standards are each denoted by an alphabetic character and are shown in bold type text beneath each general standard provides guidance for implementing the standard critical to understanding the application of these standards in particular circumstances are the administration and definitions sections found further below  general sign standards a no part of any sign shall be located within 5 feet of any public rightofway except as expressly provided herein no part of any sign that is regulated by this ordinance shall be located in any public rightofway or within 5 feet of any public rightofway actual or presumed rightofway location as described herein in the absence of survey information to establish the actual rightofway location the presumed location of the rightofway see drawing below will be determined by a line curve or series of line segments that approximately parallels the roadway edge of pavement and is tangent to the inside opposite the roadway of public utility poles on either side of the existing or proposed sign location if the presumed rightofway location can not be determined in the previously described manner due to unusually complicating factors the presumed rightofway will be assumed to be not less than 10 feet from the existing edge of pavement of the adjacent roadway the presumed rightofway method may be used to determine the proper location of portable signs and other signs except ground signs that appc152 require building permits and engineered plans ground signs requiring building permits and engineered plans shall require a survey meeting the requirements of this ordinance b no sign shall be located so as to impede the travel of pedestrians no sign shall be located so as to impede the travel of pedestrians including those in wheelchairs and motorized chairs who are traveling in public sidewalks or so as to force pedestrians to detour around the sign by using a travel or turning lane of a public street where there is no adjacent public sidewalk c no sign shall be produced or built or erected or installed or located in a manner that violates any applicable building electrical fire or life safety code where required by any applicable building electrical fire or life safety code any mandatory plan review permit or approval shall be obtained prior to the installation of a sign any sign requiring a building permit shall also require a sign permit d no sign shall be located in a manner that would interfere with the safe and convenient operation and maintenance of a utility compliance with this standard with respect to electrical facilities shall be determined by the application of clearance standards found in the 2007 national electric safety sign installation which would otherwise be required to go tennessee one call system for the protection of underground utilities must go process for underground utility location in the absence of stricter conditions of any utility easement or applicable code no part of any sign structure may be located within 4 feet of any aboveground or appc153 underground utility facility or any public or privately maintained drainage structure unless specifically approved in writing by the affected utility and the city engineer the foregoing prohibition does not affect the separation of portable signs from above ground drainage facilities and utility facilities except energized aboveground electrical facilities e no sign shall be located so as to impede visibility by turning motorists observance of required setbacks is important to maintaining visibility but the topography and other features near a sign may also affect where it is possible to safely locate the sign at an exit drive where the view of oncoming traffic or a conflicting turn movement could be obscured by the location of a sign the sign face is to be located not higher than 30 inches from the ground or not lower than 7 feet from the ground appc154 visibility triangles on adjacent streets are to be preserved in accordance with the drawing below f no sign shall be an animated sign as defined herein this prohibition includes but is not limited to flashing lights and strobe lights inside building windows that are visible from the public rightofway also prohibited are sign designs that incorporate motion electrical windactivated wateractivated or similar means these prohibitions apply to billboards and all other types of signs visible from the public rightofway except as otherwise provided herein g no sign of any type that is situated on private property and visible from a public rightofway shall be made to resemble a traffic control device appc155 traffic control devices are described in the uniform manual of traffic control devices can be viewed in the city engineers office what is prohibited here is the use of devices like stop signs or traffic signals as a sign to attract attention to a business property product or service rather than for their proper use in traffic control this is not intended to preclude the placement of appropriate signage for the purpose of traffic control on private driveways eg stop yield to pedestrians etc including in those areas near the intersection of such private driveways with public rightsofway h no sign of any type shall be allowed to be situated on any property except as allowed by this ordinance this ordinance regulates signs that are intended by their size placement or other characteristics to be read from the public rightofway or to attract the attention of persons in the public rightofway this rule is not intended to prohibit signs that otherwise comply with this ordinance where their visibility from the public rightofway is merely incidental and it is evident from the size and placement of the sign andor the size of the sign copy that it is intended exclusively for persons on the property where it is located i signs shall be kept in good repair or replaced or removed no part of the sign copy sign backing or sign structure shall be allowed to remain in place if it is bent torn ripped tattered frayed broken cracked faded dirty rusted rotted warped or with blistered or peeling paint or otherwise visibly damaged or damaged in any other way this rule is not intended to create an unreasonable requirement that signs be kept in a pristine state but it is intended to require that they remain safe functional and reasonably wellmaintained so as to not become a hazard or a blighting influence if a sign is bent over illegible due to fading in danger of falling unsafe in its electrical connections full of holes blowing loose or otherwise showing clear signs of a lack of reasonable maintenance it must be repaired replaced or removed j sign display area for a given sign shall not exceed the maximum allowed by this ordinance the maximum allowable area in square feet is given for the sign display area or sign backing for each sign types in the rules specific to each sign type a procedure for measurement is described below appc156 sign display area shall be measured according to the procedures outlined herein in the several illustrations that follow height is denoted by a and length is denoted by b with a times b being the formula for a rectangle used to calculate the sign display area in cases where a permit is required the applicant must submit an elevation drawing of the proposed sign with the necessary dimensions and calculation of the sign display area where a permit is not required the building official may perform a courtesy check of the proposed sign display area if a drawing with the appropriate information is supplied signs are not allowed to exceed the maximum allowable size regardless of whether a permit is required 1 where there is a discernable sign display area that is distinguished from other parts of the sign structure by a frame or border or by a variation in color texture or material so that the sign display area can be distinguished as a polygon from the rest of the sign structure draw the smallest rectangle that will fit around the polygon see below for specific instructions on sign cabinets where one or more frames or borders are used to form the polygon the measurement shall be from the inside edge of outermost frame or border within a single sign structure there may be more than one such polygon ie more than one discernable sign display area and the total of the areas for the rectangles drawn around these polygons will be the sign display area when calculating the sign display area subtract any overlapping area between two or more of the rectangles appc157 2 where there is no discernable sign display area and sign copy is painted on or affixed to a surface such as a wall or monument sign structure the sign area measurement shall be done grouping of individual elements of the sign copy symbols and drawings and text and numeric sign copy including any words letters numerals and punctuation that can be connected by line segments of 10 feet or less in length will be grouped together and the smallest rectangle that will fit around this grouping will be drawn beginning with the symbol drawing word letter numeral or punctuation closest to the upper left edge of the sign structure work downward and to the right drawing connecting line segments of not more than ten feet in length between any two symbols drawings words letters numerals and punctuation that can be connected in this manner to form a sign copy grouping this sign copy grouping is to be enclosed in the smallest possible rectangle continue this process until rectangles have been formed around all words letters numerals and punctuation on the sign structure the combined area of the rectangles drawn for all sign copy groupings on a sign structure is the sign display area when calculating the sign display area subtract any overlapping area between two or more of the rectangles appc158 3 sign display areas may exist on more than one sign face on a single sign structure  this is particularly the case with ground signs canopy signs and projecting signs but could also exist with other sign types sign display area should be calculated for all sign faces to determine the total sign display area for a given sign but where two sign faces overlap such that they are backtoback or separated by an interior angle of 30 degrees or less the total sign display area should be adjusted to count the sign display area on only one of these sign faces in the overlapping area appc159 4 in the case of a banner sign the sign display area is the smallest rectangle into which the banner will fit when pulled taut appc160 5 in the case of signs with sign cabinets with interior lighting or backlighting eg most type c portable signs the method described above for a discernable sign display area shall be followed for calculating the sign display area except that the polygon will be determined by the interior dimensions of the sign display cabinet 6 where sign copy is to be located on a curved or other irregular surface the dimensions of the sign display area are to be measured as if a flexible measuring tape were stretched across the surface and these dimensions are to be transferred to a single plane and enclosed by the smallest rectangle that will include them otherwise following the procedures described above for signs with or without a discernable sign display area as the case may be appc161 k lighting of signs shall not be such that it causes discomfort or distraction for passing motorists and pedestrians or such that it otherwise violates this ordinance or other applicable law lighting of signs whether internally or externally lighted and lighted copy signs are subjects of these sign regulations brightness of the illumination of signs shall not be such that it causes discomfort or distraction for passing motorists and pedestrians and led light emitting diode and similar electronic signs shall be deemed to be causing discomfort and distraction if they fail to meet the guidelines described herein electronic reader boards electronic message centers led light emitting diode signs and the like shall be equipped with and operated with automatic dimming devices that reduce the brightness of the display during cloudy or dark conditions it is intended that such led signs and similar signs be no brighter than is necessary to be visible and legible to motorists and pedestrians in the immediate vicinity during daylight or dark conditions and it is not intended that such signs would be substantially more visible and legible from a greater distance than traditional onsite signs with backlighting guidelines for led and similar technology maximum brightness for signs using led lightemitting diode or other lighting technology where the light source is used to compose the sign copy should not exceed 300 nits under nighttime conditions a nit equals candelas per meter squared cdm2 a candela is the amount of luminous flux total luminous power emitted from a source and expressed in lumens per unit solid angle in a given direction a lumen is the luminous flux emitted per unit

the sign display area shall be no more than 50 square feet notwithstanding the aforementioned size requirement commercial complexes with over 100000 square feet of finished floor space that is either under common ownership or part of a common development plan that includes a signage agreement that allots the allowable led signage area and is located within the commercial highway zoning district shall be permitted one square foot of led wall signs and the like for every 1000 square foot of finished floor space but not exceeding over 200 square feet total nor 100 square feet in any one sign lighting of signs shall not be done in a manner so as to produce motion or animation as defined herein  however this is not intended appc162 to prohibit the scrolling of an image onto a sign face provided that the entirety of the sign copy remains stationary for a period of at least six seconds the lighting of the sign shall be sustained and not flashing or blinking or pulsing the focus of external lighting shall be on the sign backing and shall be shielded so as to prevent glare onto an adjacent public rightofway or into the eyes of motorists or onto adjacent property where external lights are mounted below a sign at or near ground level they shall be shielded by landscaping on the side opposite the sign monument signs pole signs wall signs canopy signs awning signs roof signs

the regulations prescribed herein shall apply only to those portions of zones which are located inside of the corporate limits of the city of cleveland or which become located inside the corporate limits of the city of cleveland due to annexation the various zones are hereby established and defined as follows 1 approach zone  runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum greater than  mile nonprecision instrument approach zone the inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide the approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3500 feet at a horizontal distance of appc204 10000 feet from the primary surface its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway 2 transitional zones  the transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces 3 horizontal zone  the horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of 10000 feet from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs the horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones 4 conical zone  the conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there from a horizontal distance of 4000 feet  airport zone height limitations except as otherwise provided in this no structure shall be erected altered or maintained and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any airport approach surface zone transitional surface zone or horizontal surface zone to a height in excess of the applicable height herein established for such zone additionally no structure shall be erected or altered within the conical surface zone to a height in excess of the height limit herein
