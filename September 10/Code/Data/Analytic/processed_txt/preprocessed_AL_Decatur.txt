discharge permit authorization andor contract as provided herein except as authorized by the city in accordance with the provisions of this article  7708   pretreatment and user program the boards pretreatment program consists of four 4 major elements 1 the identification and categorization of dischargers into user groupings below and determination of pretreatment requirements  2 the issuance of permits or other authorization for discharge including contracts as specified in this article  3 the tracking of dischargers to ensure compliance  and 4 the enforcement of this article the purpose of this division 3 is to describe the procedures for meeting the requirements of the four 4 areas listed above the intent of these procedures is to establish the administrative mechanism to allow the efficient and effective implementation of the boards nondomestic sewer use ordinance to meet the purposes set forth in section 23111  7708   identification and categorization of users and determinations of requirements a identification of users and dischargers all dischargers of nondomestic waste are subject to this article and must be reviewed to evaluate applicability of pertinent requirements 1 existing users dischargers or contributors the primary tool for identifying existing dischargers who may be subject to the boards pretreatment requirements is a preliminary screening questionnaire industrial wastewater survey and accompanying letter of transmittal all existing dischargers will be required to respond to the industrial wastewater survey and provide the information specified the industrial wastewater survey questionnaire and letter will be sent to any known or suspected discharger for which the board and general manager do not have sufficient information on file to implement the provisions of this article the industrial wastewater survey differs for each category of discharger set forth below the function of the questionnaire is to obtain sufficient information to determine what further action will be required to categorize the discharger and establish appropriate authorization pursuant to the provisions of this article should there be no response from the recipient to the questionnaire a second questionnaire will be sent with a letter of transmittal detailing the eventual consequence of nonresponse should the second questionnaire elicit no response the name of the discharger will be referred for followup under enforcement procedures 2 new users dischargers or contributors new dischargers making application to discharge to the wastewater collection and treatment system of the board shall complete the industrial wastewater survey and permit application the function of the questionnaire is to obtain sufficient information for the board to determine appropriate authorization pursuant to the provisions of this nondomestic sewer use ordinance 3 the industrial wastewater survey may include any information as provided in ala admin 13 information characterizing such waste or wastewaters that is available to or has been provided to the user or proposed user and any such other information as is necessary to develop the appropriate permit or other authorization and necessary conditions and limitations at the discretion of the general manager where any user or proposed user fails to provide complete accurate and truthful information to the general manager board or its representatives or agents sewer service shall be denied andor any permit contract or other authorization for that user shall be terminated suspended or revoked b categorization upon receipt of the required information each user will be placed into one of the following categories for program management categorization will be made in as fair and equitable manner as possible general guidelines for identifying category placement are given below category 1 those users which have no discharge other than normal sanitary wastewater or whose nonsanitary discharge has no significant effect on the boards wastewater collection and treatment system shall be placed in this category the businesses so designated will be maintained in the boards inventory in case a change in status is required in the future for those businesses designated category 1 no permit authorization or contractual arrangement between the board and user will be required except by designation by the general manager as provided below category 2i users with wastewater discharges that do not fall under state or federal industrial pretreatment guidelines or the provisions of 40 cfr et seq  and therefore are not required to obtain a permit from said agencies however businesses with discharges that contain some constituent of concern to the board or whose discharge may have the potential to pass interfere with the operation and maintenance of the boards wastewater collection and treatment system will be subject to control by the board and general manager following receipt of complete information as required by this article the general manager will make a determination regarding the issuance of a permit or other authorization delineating specific requirements for the discharge where appropriate a permit or other authorization will be issued by the board general manager for users designated category 2i in addition the user will be subject to the boards compliance tracking program category 2fs users that prepare andor serve food commercially and are not required to obtain a state indirect discharge sid permit are placed in category 2fs a business so categorized will be subject to the boards compliance tracking program and monitored for oilgrease and any other constituents that in the general managers judgment may pass

art ii pertained to similar subject matter and derived from adopted  cross reference planning commission  2241 et seq  buildings and building regulations ch 7  emergency management ch 10  utilities ch 23 statutory authorization findings of fact purpose and objectives a statutory authorization the legislature of the state of alabama has in title 11   title 11   title 11 title 41 of the alabama 197 authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city of decatur alabama does ordain as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city of decatur alabama are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  2 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  3 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion  4 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands and  5 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters d objectives the objectives of this ordinance are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  3 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  4 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  5 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  6 to minimize prolonged business interruptions and  7 to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area a  1 12599    2215 general provisions a lands to which this article applies this article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the corporate limits
