multiplying the unit cost of treatment of each major distinguishable class of pollutant by the concentration in excess of the base use concentration of the respective pollutant in the waste discharge

from these causes by individual case analysis in addition if the rate of discharge of sewage by any contributor is of such magnitude as to increase the cost of transportation or treatment the increased costs from this excessive delivery shall also be ascertained by the superintendent and clerk by individual analysis such costs shall then be added to the base user charge of the particular contributors  1994 part 1983   2017   determination of rate of charge the city clerk no less frequently than annually shall ascertain the cost for the preceding year of operation and maintenance

year the fraction of the charges dedicated to replacement shall in no event be less than twenty percent of the total of all other operation and maintenance costs unless analysis of replacement
