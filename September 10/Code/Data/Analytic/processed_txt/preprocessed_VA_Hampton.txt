management article i  in general title and authority a this chapter shall be known as the stormwater management  b this ordinance is adopted pursuant to virginia  62144 et seq   findings of fact the health of city state and federal waters are vital to the economy of the city of hampton the city and the commonwealth of virginia  degradation of these resources from both point and nonpoint source pollution must be curtailed uncontrolled drainage and development of land have significant adverse impacts upon the health safety and welfare of the community the purpose of this chapter is a to implement the chesapeake bay preservation act virginia 195 as amended  62144 et seq the virginia stormwater management act virginia  62144 et seq and the federal clean water act at the local level and b to protect the quality of state waters as authorized under virginia  62144 et seq  specifically 1 stormwater runoff may carry pollutants into receiving water bodies degrading water quality  2 the increase in nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen adversely affects flora and fauna  3 improperly channeling water increases the velocity of runoff thereby increasing erosion and sedimentation  4 certain lands that are proximate to shorelines have intrinsic water quality value due to the ecological and biological processes they perform  5 construction requiring the alteration of natural topography and removal of vegetation tends to increase erosion  6 siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases their capacity to hold and transport water interferes with navigation and harms flora and fauna  7 impervious surfaces increase the volume rate and pollutant load of stormwater runoff and allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and increasing erosion and surface water pollution  8 improperly managed stormwater runoff may increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur thus endangering property and human life  9 improperly managed stormwater runoff may interfere with the maintenance of optimum salinity in estuarine areas thereby disrupting biological productivity  10 substantial economic losses result from these adverse impacts on city and state waters  and 11 future water degradation may be avoided if land is developed in accordance with sound stormwater management practices   purpose and objectives a the purpose of this chapter is to ensure the general health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city and protect the quality and quantity of state waters from the potential harm of unmanaged stormwater including protection from a landdisturbing activity causing unreasonable degradation of properties water quality stream channels and other natural resources and to establish procedures whereby stormwater requirements related to water quality and quantity shall be administered and enforced b in order to protect maintain and enhance both the immediate and longterm health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city this chapter has the following objectives 1 to balance development interests and natural resources of the city  2 to protect restore or maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of city and state waters in such conditions that will permit all reasonable public uses and will support the propagation and growth of all aquatic life including game fish which might reasonably be expected to inhabit them  3 to prevent activities which harm the city by adversely affecting water resources  4 to encourage the construction of drainage systems which maintain or functionally approximate existing natural systems  5 to encourage the protection of natural drainageways and the use of them in ways which do not impair their beneficial functioning  6 to prevent any increase in the transport of pollutants to city and state waters  7 to maintain or restore groundwater levels  8 to protect maintain or restore natural salinity levels in estuarine areas  9 to minimize erosion and sedimentation  10 to prevent damage to wetlands and resource protection areas as defined herein  11 to prevent damage from flooding while recognizing that natural fluctuations in water levels are beneficial  12 to protect restore and maintain fish and wildlife habitat in the watersheds of the city  and 13 to ensure attainment of these objectives by requiring the approval and implementation of stormwater management plans for all activities which may have an adverse impact upon city and state waters   definitions

establish reasonable standards that permit and control development along corridors of the city identified in the citys comprehensive plan as appropriate for residential transition uses the plan recognizes the need to implement a new land use designation that provides a transition between major thoroughfares and adjacent low density residential areas this land use category would allow the properties along these corridors to develop or redevelop in a manner that best utilizes their frontage and access without detrimental impacts on surrounding residential development this article recognizes that this transition may be accomplished differently depending upon the corridor affected and the desires and needs of the surrounding community and therefore allows for separate residential transition districts should they be necessary rt1 districtresidential transition todds lane and big bethel road 1 intent rt1 is intended to accomplish four 4 specific objectives identified in the todds lanebig bethel road corridors study a to create a district that serves as a buffer between singlefamily residential districts and major arterial streets  b to create a district that allows only uses compatible with singlefamily development recognizing that these uses may be interspersed with residential development along the corridors  c to create a district that allows nonresidential development but which requires that development to maintain the existing residential scale along the corridors  and d to create a district that will not significantly increase traffic along the corridors by allowing only those uses that generate no more than two and onehalf 2 times the total average daily traffic trips generated by singlefamily development or eightyeight 88 trips per acre the intent of the rt1 district is to allow conversion of existing buildings or new construction in a manner that maintains the visual character and architectural scale of existing development

of the recommendations and policies of the buckroe master plan 200 as amended guiding development redevelopment and revitalization activities in the buckroe bayfront area buckroe is a unique place in the hampton roads region with a neighborhood and architectural character that is an asset that must be protected and enhanced as new development becomes a part of the buckroe community buckroes character is based on its dual role as both a chesapeake bay beachfront community that draws visitors from areas beyond the neighborhood and as a primarily singlefamily residential neighborhood in the city of hampton the buckroe master plan 200 as amended provides the design principles that reflect these aspects of buckroes character balancing between its two 2 roles and guiding the scale and location for new development and public improvements the buckroe bayfront districts are also intended to reinforce buckroes compact walkable environment and promote a community design that is environmentally and economically sustainable 2 the city of hampton has been engaged in the revitalization of the buckroe neighborhood since 1964 when the first of a series of redevelopment plans was generated while the scale and nature of the proposed redevelopment in buckroe has changed over time the basic premise that the beach represents an asset that could be leveraged for new high quality development to spur revitalization in the greater buckroe area has remained the buckroe master plan 200 as amended replaces these previous redevelopment plans and the buckroe bayfront districts are a tool to achieve this longstanding objective of the citys efforts in buckroe 3 as permitted by the virginia  1522283 purpose of zoning ordinances the buckroe bayfront districts establish standards for development in buckroe in order to a preserve and extend those elements of the buckroe neighborhood which contribute to its neighborhood and architectural character design and placement of building types b enhance the quality of street spaces placement massing and design in order to create a safe environment that supports pedestrians bicyclists and drivers c create safe public streets parks and other areas by designing neighboring buildings to enhance an eyes on the streetpark effect with windows and primary entrances facing onto public spaces d provide a degree of predictability to property owners and community residents regarding what may be built on land in the community while also allowing for some flexibility in the mixture of land uses e encourage a range of building types and sizes that will accommodate people at all stages of life and allow for an economically diverse community f facilitate the creation of a convenient attractive and harmonious community whose planning and architectural design will support long term value and economic stability in the greater buckroe community 4 there shall be five 5 buckroe bayfront districts i bb1single family residential ii bb2mixed

to regulate in a manner consistent with the rights of individual property owners and the requirements of military operations at langley air force base lafb development of uses and structures that are incompatible with military operations  to sustain the economic health of the city and hampton roads region  to protect and preserve the public health safety and welfare from the adverse impacts associated with high levels of noise from flight operations at lafb and the potential for aircraft accidents associated with proximity to airport operations  and to maintain the overall quality of life of those who live work and recreate in the city of hampton 2 findings the city council hereby finds that a langley air force base is among the oldest continuously active air bases in the united states and its history parallels the history of military aviation in the united states first as an element of the army and then as a separate military department in december 191 the land that became langley field was the first property ever purchased by the united states for aviation purposes in 191 the national advisory council for aeronautics naca predecessor to the national aeronautics and space administration nasa established the need for a joint airfield and proving ground for army navy and naca aircraft with the advent of world war i langley field became an air station with coastal defense responsibilities langley air force base has historically functioned as a headquarters first for the army and later for the air force major command responsible for fighter aircraft with the arrival of the tactical air command and jet aircraft in 1948 langley field officially became langley air force base over its history units at lafb have been tapped to assist in virtually all the nations military engagements lafb is a vital component in the architecture of the defense departments joint service method of operational planning and execution and in the newlyemerging interagency approach to meeting homeland defense requirements  b langley air force base generates a significant economic impact on the economies of hampton and the surrounding jurisdictions the installations economic impact analysis for fy08 indicates that lafb had a financial impact of nearly $13 billion just over half of that figure was attributed to annual payroll to military and civilian personnel while over onethird  13  was in local expenditures construction services materials supplies and equipment lafb estimated that six thousand five hundred seventyseven 6577 indirect jobs were created by the installation and its activities which equated to a value of nearly two hundred three million dollars $20300000000 for fiscal year fy 200 lafb supported nearly twentysix thousand 26000 personnel this number includes almost eleven thousand 11000 active duty military air force reserve and air national guard personnel and nearly thirteen thousand 13000 active duty military dependents there were two thousand three hundred thirtyone 2331 civilians employed at lafb making lafb one of the single largest employers in the city of hampton  c the closure or realignment of langley air force base would have serious adverse economic consequences to the city and the region  and d in 201 the city of hampton along with the cities of poquoson newport news and york county joined with the air force and lafb to undertake the hamptonlangley joint land use study jlus as a proactive and preventative effort to ensure mutual beneficial growth and development at lafb and the jurisdictions it encompasses and abuts in furtherance of the hamptonlangley jlus and to avoid conflicts previously experienced between the united states military and local communities in hampton roads the city council hereby adopts general regulations applicable in all airport noise zones greater than seventy 70 db dnl and aircraft accident potential zones to help prevent any additional encroachment at lafb

with the goals and objectives of the adopted hampton comprehensive plan the zoning administrator may decline to apply parking credits when there is evidence that the existing parking conditions upon a site or within a district are such that application of all or some of the eligible parking credits will further contribute toward an existing condition in which parking is already inadequate based upon requirements of this ordinance unsafe as determined by the police division fire department or city traffic engineer andor is creating negative offsite impacts to adjoining land uses 1 shared parking the shared parking model can be used as a basis for predicting the overall parking demand for a particular mix of land uses on a site as an alternative to the application of individual parking requirements specified in tables 1121  this model assumes that every separate use will need the full amount of parking that is called for in the parking requirements table at some point during the day called the peak period for that use where different uses need parking at different times of the day there is an opportunity for these uses to share parking the total number of parking spaces needed to serve a mix of uses the parking demand may be significantly less than the number of spaces that would have to be built if each of the uses had to provide one hundred 100 percent of its own required parking shared parking credits may be applied to a mixeduse site as specified in table 1181 shared parking credit schedule under the following conditions 1 the land contains a mix of two 2 or more land uses and is under single ownership  or 2 the land contains a mix of two 2 or more land uses and operates under a joint use agreement which permits shared use of parking the shared parking agreement shall include all of the following terms to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator and city attorney a consent of all applicable property owners b the number and location of all parking spaces being shared with an exhibit depicting such spaces c a minimum 20year term d a provision requiring 90days prior written notice to the director of community development upon amendment or termination of the agreement e provisions allowing for the use of the parking spaces during all times relevant to the use necessitating the parking spaces as determined by the zoning administrator f an acknowledgement that upon termination of the shared parking agreement the grantee of the credits may be in violation of the zoning ordinance unless the required parking is provided by alternate means prior to the termination date of the shared parking agreement and g any other such term reasonably required by the city based upon the unique circumstances of a particular case notwithstanding the abovedescribed 20year term such shared parking agreement may include a provision allowing termination of the agreement by either party at any time provided 90days prior written notice is provided

difference of one hundred twentysix 126 spaces step 5 if these two 2 numbers are different there is the potential to reduce the required minimum parking for the entire project to the lower of the two 2 numbers ultimately that choice is the land ownerdevelopers to make 2 onstreet parking and offsite parking all onstreet and offsite parking credits shall only apply to parking that is generally available to the public and not restricted in any way which would limit its ability to meet the parking demands of the intended land use a onstreet parking credit onstreet parking credits may be applied to any lot onstreet parking within the public rightsofway immediately adjacent and on the same side of the street to the subject site may be counted towards the minimum required parking b offsite parking credit where parking is available offsite and within five hundred 500 feet of any publically accessible pedestrian entry point to a building it may be counted towards the minimum required parking under the following conditions i the offsite parking is owned or controlled by a public entity and the requested parking credit is approved in writing by the appropriate authority the public entity shall maintain an inventory of parking space credits provided and the spaces within the lot in which they exist credits shall not be granted beyond the number of spaces available with the exception for instances when the uses involved qualify for parking credits under section 1181 as amended  or ii the offsite parking is owned or controlled by a private entity with a legally binding shared parking agreement the shared parking agreement shall include all of the following terms to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator and city attorney a consent of all applicable property owners b the number and location of all parking spaces being shared with an exhibit depicting such spaces c a minimum 20year term d a provision requiring 90days prior written notice to the director of community development upon amendment or termination of the agreement e provisions allowing for the use of the parking spaces during all times relevant to the use necessitating the parking spaces as determined by the zoning administrator f an acknowledgement that upon termination of the shared parking agreement the grantee of the credits may be in violation of the zoning ordinance unless the required parking is provided by alternate means prior to the termination date of the shared parking agreement and g any other such term reasonably required by the city based upon the unique circumstances of a particular case notwithstanding the abovedescribed 20year term such shared parking agreement may include a provision allowing termination of the agreement by either party at any time provided 90days prior written notice is provided to the director of community development and all parties to the agreement the shared parking agreement shall be in a form suitable for recordation in the deed books maintained by the clerk of the circuit court of the city of hampton and accompanied by a check made payable to the clerk of the circuit court of the city of hampton in an amount required by the clerk to cover recording fees iii convenient and safe pedestrian access ways shall be provided from the offsite parking to the primary entrances of the subject use offsite parking shall not be approved without the existence of such improvements required pedestrian access ways shall be designated on a submitted site plan and shall be approved by the director of of community development or designee 3 transit parking credits in areas served by affordable and convenient transit service parking demand can be affected the degree to which transit service impacts parking demand is influenced by a number of factors including the type and density of surrounding development the existing supply and cost of parking and the quality of transit service generally accessible to the traveling public in order to provide appropriately tailored transit credits that are customized to the unique set of forces influencing parking demand in any given geographic area of the city transit overlay zones may be established for defined geographic areas of the city in general transit overlay zones may enact land use transportation and parking policies which encourage the provision of multiple modes of transportation and will typically include higher density compact mixeduse development districts referred to as transit oriented development tod within any adopted transit overlay zone transit parking credits may be established that are appropriate for that geographic area 4 mixeduse districtground floor retailcommercial credit in mixeduse districts as designated in the adopted hampton comprehensive plan small area plans neighborhood plans and master plans the first three thousand 3000 square feet of pedestrian oriented ground floor commercial retail space shall be exempt from the calculation to determine the minimum required parking this credit shall be calculated based upon specific information building size uses ownership etc provided to the city of hampton at the time of site plan review or building permit review 5 other parking credits the zoning administrator may also grant parking credits based upon request by an applicant the applicant requesting such consideration shall supply documentation regarding parking data anticipated parking demand anticipated peak parking demand times of day week and month relevant to the specific site and proposed uses as well as parking data relevant to the surrounding area other relevant data may also be requested of the applicant andor local state and federal agencies all such information shall be reviewed by the director of public works and the planning director and a recommendation forwarded to the zoning administrator prior to making a final decision to grant parking credits not specified elsewhere in this chapter the zoning administrator shall consider granting other parking credits only when the applicants submitted request and supporting data meets one 1 or more of the following conditions a adherence to the applicable parking standards is not necessary and will result in excess parking spaces because the mixture of existing or proposed uses will generate a high proportion of multiple destination vehicle trips  or b adherence to the applicable parking standards is not necessary and will result in excess parking spaces because there will be a high level of pedestrian carpool andor public transit traffic serving the use  or c adherence to the applicable parking standards within a historic district designated by the federal government commonwealth of virginia or within a locally adopted preservation district will be detrimental to the historic character of the district and thus deviation from the adopted standards furthers the public interest in preserving and maintaining these historic community assets 6 parking exemptions and reductions to recognize the unique character of established urban neighborhoods and the provision of alternative parking options nearby the following zoning districts shall have parking requirements exempted or reduced as described below a oih district residential development on substandard lots as set forth in chapter 9 article 5 of the
