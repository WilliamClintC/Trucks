secondary affects on the areas surrounding these types of business uses that these types of uses are consistently and strongly associated with perceived decreases in the value of both residential and commercial properties and that they facilitate illicit and undesirable and in some cases criminal activities that are detrimental to the town and to its inhabitants such adult business establishments can often be incompatible with surrounding uses particularly where a number of these types of uses are concentrated within a limited geographical area or are located in close proximity to residential

negative secondary affects of such adult use establishments tm of 515200 art 42 purpose the requirements and regulations of this article are directed to controlling negative secondary affect of adult

location in proximity to other types of uses that are incompatible including but not limited to those uses listed in section 10402 above these regulations performance standards and licensing requirements are necessary and appropriate to minimize the negative secondary affects identified in section 10402 above to protect incompatible uses from exposure to adult use establishment operations

equipment so as to provide adequate visibility and increased safety for pedestrians and vehicles while making the most efficient use of energy with minimal expenditure by providing an adequate level of illumination and uniformity of distribution along roadways satisfactory visibility and lighting patterns can be achieved that will aid vehicle and pedestrian travel and minimize potential conflict between the two lighting also promotes the visual appeal of a community and creates an environment that pedestrians feel safe accessing during the night too much light cast by overhead streetlights creates glare for vehicles and pedestrians alike and obscures the aesthetics of a nighttime downtown environment creating a streetscape that can appear dreary and empty sufficient street lighting provides a necessary amount of light and contributes to an environment that pedestrians feel comfortable accessing at night ornamental and streetscape lighting has demonstrated an improved visual appeal for the town of lisbon along main and village streets properly installed ornamental lighting creates an environment that is aesthetically pleasing and inviting to nighttime use by pedestrians the town of lisbons street lighting standards as promulgated in this policy account for factors such as traffic volume nighttime pedestrian activity crime prevention light pollution and energy conservation it is understood that while vehicle headlights are the preferred method of illumination for vehicles street lighting is particularly useful in areas of potential vehicle and pedestrian conflict such as intersections and other pedestrian crossing locations additionally along routes with high vehicle travel volume the pattern of poles and street lighting can provide guidance to motorists it is also understood that ornamental and streetscape lighting is the preferred method of lighting for pedestrian travel and safety overhead street lighting creates downwardcast shadows while properly designed streetscape lighting illuminates the faces of pedestrians and creates an inviting ambiance for pedestrians based on studies of the relationship between street lighting and crime it can be concluded that streetlights will not reduce the likelihood that crimes will take place  however properly located lighting reduces the perceived fear associated with crime increasing the likelihood that pedestrians will access the center and falls at night thus contributing to an effect of more eyes on the street lighting levels for roadway street lighting is generally based on illuminating engineering society of north america ies recommendations contained in ies publication rp800 roadway lighting ies guidelines are based on geometric operational and environmental factors and suggest average roadway luminance and uniformity ratios to reduce traffic accidents although the ies standards are desirable to attain for roadways with high traffic volumes the ies standard do not easily translate to rural and residential roadway lighting applications where traffic flow and speed are not the primary concern the standards recommended by the ies would be best applied to lisbon on roadways where traffic flow speed and the potential pedestrian conflicts are of primary concern such as sections of main street in lisbon falls and village street in lisbon center the standards and ordinances for streetlight that were referenced in the development of this policy include 1 american national standard practice for roadway lighting illuminating engineering society of

policy of the town of lisbon to encourage the use of open space subdivisions in order to preserve a sense of space provide for agriculture and forestry as well as recreational land preserve other resources identified in the town of lisbon comprehensive plan and harmonize new development with the traditional open wooded agricultural and village landscapes this standard is intended to implement that policy by providing incentives that afford flexibility to a subdivider in road and lot layout and design placement of residential structures and road frontage requirements and by allowing the planning board to waive or reduce certain otherwise applicable standards and provisions of this chapter and zoning if the subdivider commits to the permanent preservation of important open space resources it shall not be construed as granting variances from dimensional standards when the planning board grants waivers provided for in this section as allowed for in 30a mrsa  43534c these incentives are designed to encourage greater flexibility and more innovative approaches to housing and environmental design that will promote the most appropriate use of land and will preserve as permanent open space agricultural or forestry land important natural features wildlife habitat water resources ecological systems and historic and scenic areas for the benefit of present and future residents b a open space subdivision achieves the purposes of this performance standard by reducing the lot size frontage and setback requirements as contained in modifying the road design standards and clustering housing and uses in those areas where they have the least impact on identified environmental agricultural and other open space resources these resources are then permanently preserved

worumbo site this area is proposed to be rezoned from commercial to village village zoning would allow for more mixed uses including residential which is not allowed in commercial and has more flexible dimensional standards such as setbacks and lot coverage which may help with the redevelopment of the waterfront area the commercial zone also allows some potentially incompatible land uses in the village such as warehousing truck terminals electricalplumbingcontractor yards or manufacturing none of the existing land uses would become nonconforming by rezoning to village  cm of 6212016 v

the title of division 2 to read as herein set out purpose the mapped sand and gravel aquifers should be capable of providing substantial quantities of water for existing and potential uses both public and private by nature they are sensitive to pollution the purpose of the aquifer protection overlay district is to protect the towns sand and gravel aquifers and public drinking water supplies from adverse development or land use practices that have the potential to reduce the quality and quantity of groundwater that is now and in the future will be available for use by the municipalities individuals and industries in order to protect existing public water supply sources and provide for potential future sources the lisbon water department has mapped areas that contribute groundwater to the towns supply wells and identified aquifer areas that may serve as future supplies for private or public uses cm of 8162011 v 2011153  cm of 10212014 v 2014220 establishment and delineation 1 for the purposes of this division there is hereby established the aquifer protection overlay district consisting of sand and gravel aquifers and which is divided into three zones requiring varying degrees of protection the aquifer protection overlay district and each of the zones are delineated on the official zoning map entitled zoning map of lisbon maine this map shall be deemed an integral part of this division and shall be filed at the town office wellheads aquifers and aquifer recharge areas are defined in part by emery & garrett 1993 the cost of no wellhead protection in maine and by standard geologic and hydrologic investigations which may include drilling observation wells performing pumping tests water sampling and geologic mapping new areas identified by any of these methods may be added to this chapter by amendment due to the limitations of hydrogeological techniques exact boundaries of aquifers have some uncertainty provisions are made for applicants to provide information on the location of the district boundary as pertains to a particular parcel of land or development a aquifer protection overlay zones  there are three zones to the aquifer protection overlay district as follows 1 zone 1 immediate wellhead recharge zones zone 1 extends from each public water supply wellhead to the 200day groundwater timeoftravel boundary 2 zone 2 primary recharge zones zone 2 extends from the outer boundary of zone 1 to the 2500day timeoftravel boundary zone 2 also includes an area within the aquifer located in the northwesterly portion of town and adjacent to the androscoggin river a test well was done there and a portion of the aquifer was identified hydrogeologic evaluation as a potential new municipal well location zone 2 standards shall be applied to that area within the aquifer centered at the test wellhead and having a radius of 1500 feet a any test well created in any other area of the town that is identified by the board of water commissioners as viable for development as a source of municipal water and certified by a qualified hydrogeologist or equivalent may also be considered part of zone 2 where it is located and within a circle having a radius of 1500 feet from the test well head however a test well may only be considered part of zone 2 if it is identified as viable for development as a source of municipal water and action to include the new wellhead area within zone 2 is pursuant to section 707 of this chapter 3 zone 3 sand and gravel aquifer zones zone 3 includes the remainder of the sand and gravel aquifers and aquifer recharge areas zone 3 areas may provide secondary longterm recharge to public water supply wellheads or serve as potential sources of significant quantities of groundwater for future private and public uses mapping of these areas coincides with sand and gravel aquifer maps produced by the maine geological survey and united states geological survey 2 pursuant to section 707 the delineation of the aquifer protection overlay district and zones may be revised by the town council as the extent of the wellheads aquifers and recharge areas are more accurately defined 3 where the bounds as delineated are in doubt or in dispute the burden of proof shall be upon the applicant disputing the boundary of the land in question to show where the bounds should properly be located the applicant disputing the boundary shall engage a professional geologist or a professional hydrologist to determine more accurately the location and extent of an aquifer or recharge area the consultant to be engaged shall be approved by the planning board the cost of the investigation shall be completely borne by the applicant disputing the boundary 4 where there is conflict between the provisions of this

purpose  the route 196 design standards along with the accompanying design guidelines have been developed to support the vision of the route 196 corridor master plan adopted by the lisbon council in october 2013 the purpose of design standards and guidelines is to provide a tool for the town of lisbon to improve the visual character of the route 196 corridor these standards and guidelines are meant to ensure that new development and redevelopment is designed and constructed with desired character in terms of architecture scale site layout and aestheticvisual effect they are meant to ensure that property owners developers contractors and other professionals understand the community values ie those values expressed by the comprehensive plan and route 196 master plan which their designs must satisfy to be acceptable to the town because the design standards and guidelines cannot anticipate the unique conditions or opportunities present on individual properties there may be occasions where a specific standard or guideline may not apply in such cases it is incumbent upon both the applicant and those charged with reviewing and approving the proposed project to arrive at solutions that are still in keeping with the spirit and intent of the larger principals of the standards and guidelines 2 goals  the town of lisbon has several existing ordinances which address design issues such as land use and zoning dimensional standards impacts on neighboring properties and uses environmental or engineering design requirements etc the route 196 design standards and accompanying design guidelines are meant to supplement those ordinance regulations with more emphasis on the visual and aesthetic character of the route 196 corridor therefore the goals include a establishing a

iv  mailbox policy mailboxes for convenience and practicality mailbox installations have been allowed within the rightofway of maines public highways  however it is important to recognize that such installations have two very important conditions 1 the mailbox must be installed in accordance with applicable standards to ensure that mail can be delivered and that the mailbox does not create an obstacle or safety hazard to those that use or maintain the highway  and 2 the mailbox is installed entirely at the owners risk in other words if the mailbox incurs damage during any sort of highway operations or maintenance the property owner is not entitled to replacement or compensation in fact if the mailbox was not installed in accordance with the applicable standards as stated above the owner may even be held liable for injuries or damages that may have been incurred as a result mailbox design and installation standards are available from several sources and mailbox owners are expected to consult this information prior to undertaking any mailbox installation or replacement the following standards have nationwide relevance and were developed in cooperation with one another  the united states postal service usps mailbox guidelines the usps defines the standards for mailbox construction as well as the placement tolerance that must be met to accommodate postal operations specifics may be obtained from your local post office or online at   american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto roadside design guide the aashto roadside design guide erecting mailboxes on streets and highways deals with the safety and construction of privately owned mailboxes mailbox supports and mailbox turnout designs and is less focused on postal operations this publication may be obtained online aashto bookstore at  in addition if the mailbox is to be installed in an area with sidewalks it is important to recognize that the sidewalks must continue to comply with ada requirements  american disabilities act ada the most current version of the ada standards for accessible design set forth the minimum requirements to ensure facilities are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities  the municipality has developed this policy to promote compliance with these national standards and to help further clarify the expectations and responsibilities of maine mailbox owners such compliance helps us ensure that we continue to provide safe efficient and accessible highways for all the following pages further specify the details associated with mailbox height location offset and post type to minimize the potential hazards and conflicts associated with mailbox installations and to reduce the opportunities for damage to mailboxes mailbox installation standards general location whenever possible your mailbox should be located after your driveway opening this location placement improves visibility minimizes the amount of snow that comes off the snow plow and improves the approach for your mail carrier the diagram below further clarifies this preferred placement mailbox support design in many cases it is best to use an extended arm type of post with a freeswinging suspended mailbox this allows snowplows to sweep near or under boxes without damage to supports and provides easy access to the boxes by carrier and customers the following picture shows a freeswinging suspended mailbox in addition note the strategic placement of the red reflector on the point closest to the road this will help your local snowfighter see and avoid your mailbox during winter storms offset mailboxes should be set back from the edge of the shoulderregardless of whether the shoulder is gravel or paved in other words the face of the mailbox should be at least one foot 1 back from the edge of the normally plowed surface of the highway or the face of curb greater offset distances are encouraged whenever possible to allow the mail carrier to get further out of traffic and to further minimize potential damage to your mailbox the following picture shows a mailbox with a reasonable offset mailboxes in sidewalk areas should leave at least 36 behind the back of the box or the post whichever is located the furthest from the road height according to usps standards a mailbox must be installed with the bottom of the mailbox located between 41 and 45 high above the surface of the highway shoulder we recommend that this height be closer to the 45 measurement to minimize conflict with the height of the plow truck wing when snow is being pushed back during or between winter storms the following picture further clarifies the height considerations post size type and embedment mailbox posts must be sturdy enough to hold up the mailbox in all types of weather conditions however they cannot be so rugged that they present a hazard to vehicles that inadvertently leave the road if a mailbox support is struck by a vehicle it must easily break away therefore the following types of posts are deemed acceptable  4 x 4 wooden posts embedded 2 feet into the ground larger wooden posts 4 x 6 or 6 x 6 may be used only if the post is drilled an appropriate spade bit to create a shear plane the following diagram indicates the necessary holes and spacing  1 to 2 round diameter steel or aluminum pipe or standard uchannel post embedded 2 feet into the ground  unacceptable mailbox supports include anything that is filled with concrete masonry and stone structures heavy steel structures and most objects that were intended for other uses eg antique plows ibeams and various other household tools and objects notice mailboxes attachments or support systems not consistent with this policy are considered deadly fixed objects aka dfos and are in violation of 23 mrsa  1401a on state and state aid roads on local roads they can be considered as obstructions and a number of statutes relate to these obstructions as such when these installations are recognized by the municipality the owner will be informed of the hazard and immediate removal will be requested if the property owner does not comply with this request the municipality may elect to remove the installation and seek reimbursement from the property owner for all costs incurred  cm of 5172016 v 2016118  policy for disposition of townowned real
