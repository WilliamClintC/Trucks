pretreatment regulations requiring all publicly owned treatment works potws with approved pretreatment programs to develop and implement an enforcement response plan erp to provide guidance to control authority personnel in identifying documenting and responding to pretreatment violations  1365  the clean water act cwa sets forth basic requirements to regulate the nature and quantity of industrial wastes discharged to potws  regulations such as 40 cfr  403 the us epa has revised part 403 pursuant to sections 307b and 402b 8 of the cwa the most recent revision to part 403 resulted in the promulgation of a final rule on  contained within part 4038f 5 is a list of minimum requirements for the development of an erp the elements of the erp identified below describe a process to identify document and respond to pretreatment violations in a timely and equitable manner consistent with relevant state and federal law and with the legal authority contained in title 13 water and sewer also known as the sewer use ordinance suo the goal of the erp is to describe the manner in which the city of douglas city enforces its pretreatment program to meet federal and state pretreatment program requirements the key elements of the erp meet the requirements of federal regulations at 40 cfr 4038f5  describe how the potw will investigate instances of noncompliance   describe the types of escalating enforcement responses the potw will take in response to all anticipated types of industrial user violations and the time periods within which responses will take place   identify by title the officials responsible for each type of response  and  adequately reflect the potws primary responsibility to enforce all applicable pretreatment requirements and standards as detailed in 40 cfr  4038f 1 and 2 food service establishments fses within the city of douglas service area are subject to the fse enforcement response guide fseerg which exists as a separate document the fseerg ensures a consistent response to all food service establishments that cause or have the potential to cause interference obstruction sanitary sewer overflows bypasses or storm water inflow to the city sanitary sewer collection system and wastewater treatment plants fses are nondomestic users and are monitored by the city under its fats oils and grease fog control program this fseerg is intended to be used for food service establishments and users that contribute fog to the citys sanitary sewer system refer to the citys suo and fog management policy for additional information on the citys fog control program to investigate noncompliance methods used by the potw to investigate the compliance status of the industrial user user include but are not limited to the following 11 field inspections field inspection is an onsite presence of trained personnel to gather data for immediate fact determination or evaluation of compliance the types of data gathered include documents statements and observations physical evidence and information may also be collected as evidence that may lead to enforcement 12 surveillance sampling surveillance sampling is performed by obtaining a representative sample of a discharged substance in accordance with regulatory requirements typically surveillance samples of discharge from user operations are taken by pretreatment personnel 13 document review document review includes the analysis of data that relates to the compliance status of a user such as user  1366  correspondence selfmonitoring report forms and baseline monitoring reports 14 meetings meetings both formal and informal with a user are utilized to obtain and share information which relates to any aspect of the pretreatment program meetings may be used to investigate technical issues laboratory analysis sampling procedureslocations application of regulations etc or concerns about the compliance status of a user or to gather facts concerning alleged violations 15 increased monitoring increased monitoring by submission of samples andor records may be required of the user to provide further data to demonstrate the compliance status 16 technical evaluationresearch in making the determination of a users compliance status when substantial technical considerations exist an evaluation of the best available scientific and technical information will be made this evaluation may include the assistance of technical resource people industrial or regulatory subject matter experts or documents from research pilot studies etc 17 interaction with other agencies review of local and state files communication with the state and local departments of environmental quality the southern arizona environmental crimes task force and the citys attorneys office is utilized to further investigate the compliance status 18 other methods other methods to establish the compliance status may be used as the need arises on a casebycase basis types of escalating responses this section describes the range of available enforcement actions the enforcement philosophy is progressive  that is problems are addressed at the lowest level and with the least formality possible consistent with the specific program however it should be remembered that the severity of the enforcement action is not dependent upon the completion of any less formal procedures and depending upon the factual scenario presented a formal procedure may be needed for the initial action listed below are available enforcement actions 21 deterrents to enforcement actions 21a annual public notice in accordance with the requirements and definition of significant noncompliance snc in the citys suo a list of users who are in snc at any time during the previous year is published in a newspapers of general circulation that provide meaningful public notice within 120 days of the end of the calendar year 22 preenforcement 22a request for information a request for information to determine if noncompliance is occurring can be verbal or written 22b regulatory compliance assistance meetings are held for users to discuss compliance questions and to assist the user in understanding the requirements of the permit and to identify available resources 22c verbal warnings an attempt to make contact is made by telephone to a users authorized representative explaining the nature of the discrepancy the user is encouraged to return to compliance 22d written warning a written warning may be sent to a users authorized representative explaining the nature of the discrepancy and seeking further information in determining noncompliance 23 enforcement 23a notification of violation nov  1367  a notification of violation states the violations may require submittal of information and requires the user to take any corrective action necessary to prevent the recurrence of the violations an nov may include but is not limited to  an order of corrective action this order requires the user to carry out a corrective plan of action to prevent the recurrence of noncompliance the user has ten 10 days to respond in writing from the time of receipt of the letter explaining reasons for the violations and detailing a plan of corrective action  an order to respond an order to respond requires the user to respond in writing to allegations of noncompliance  a compliance schedule a compliance schedule may be made part of an enforcement order the deadline dates are subject to civil penalties and are as enforceable as a discharge limit  an order to show cause an order to show cause is an action to allow the user the opportunity to show cause why the city should not request the city of douglas attorney to petition the courts to impose assess and recover a sum not to exceed one thousand dollars $100000 for each day in which the violations has occurred the user has ten 10 days to respond in writing explaining the reasons for the violations and detailing a plan of corrective action  an order to cease discharge an order to cease discharge orders the user to cease discharge of industrial waste to the potw by a specified time as provided in the order and to carry out a corrective plan of action to prevent the recurrence of noncompliance to enable the lifting of the cease discharge order in addition a show cause meeting is scheduled the user is required to respond within ten 10 days in writing to the nov a meeting between the user and the potw will occur at the earliest convenience of the user but no later than the date specified in the order  intent to suspend intent to suspend establishes a performance standard which must be demonstrated within a specific time limit failure to comply invokes permit suspension  permit suspension permit suspension states the violations informs the user of permit suspension and outlines the corrective actions the user must carry out before the permit is reactivated and the city manager or director reallows discharge in addition a show cause meeting may be scheduled the user has ten 10 days to respond in writing to the nov  permit revocation permit revocation informs the user of permit revocation and discharge prohibition and outlines corrective actions the user must carry out before the user can apply for a new permit the user has ten 10 days to respond in writing to the nov  other orders the city manager or director may issue additional orders determined appropriate additional orders and changes to a suspension or revocation may follow the initial order at the discretion of the city manager or director or as additional information becomes available 23b sewer service termination sewer service termination is authorized when it is necessary to cease a discharge from a user that could present a hazard to public health safety or welfare environment or the potw 23c emergency authority the use of emergency authority is authorized when a violation presents an immediate hazard to public health safety or welfare environment or to the potw any of the  1368  enforcement action options can be used in the event of the need for emergency authority invocation including judicial actions consisting of temporary restraining orders or preliminary or permanent injunctions 23d judicial actions whenever the city manager or director finds that a user has violated any of the provisions of the citys suo the city of douglas attorney may be requested to take appropriate legal action this legal action may include but is not limited to  prohibitive injunctions   mandatory injunctions for corrective action and cleanup   civil penalties pursuant to ars  49391   criminal penalties pursuant to ars  11 2515  ars  132311 fraudulent schemes and practices  ars  131201

filed with superior court becomes final the city shall provide a period of thirty 30 days for public comment ars  49391c criminal prosecution the city of douglas attorney has authority pursuant to ars  11 25105 under state law for criminal prosecution of users who violate provisions of the ordinance and other state laws the city may seek criminal prosecution when there is evidence of willfulness negligence or bad faith shown by the user for  violations of the    violations of industrial wastewater discharge permits such as discharges in excess of permit limits or failure to submit selfmonitoring reports   violations of orders for corrective actions issued to implement pretreatment requirements such as orders to cease discharge or show cause orders   failure to notify the control authority of unauthorized discharges such as slug loads   falsification of records  or  tampering with monitoring equipment violations which continue for more than one day shall be deemed separate and distinct offenses for each day the epa guidance document for developing control authority enforcement response plans suggests that bad faith is typically demonstrated by a lack of cooperation and incompleteness of corrective measures in a timely manner 24 alternative conflict resolution conflicts can also be resolved by alternative methods agreed upon by both the user and the city on a casebycase basis as not to conflict with state statutes examples of actions include the pollution prevention school pps used to educate nonsignificant users in lieu of assessing a penalty and negotiated settlement agreements 24a pollution prevention school pps purpose to educate users in lieu of assessing a pretreatment penalty who for the first time have one violation related to sampling monitoring and submission of reports with respect to their industrial wastewater discharge permits and the industrial wastewater attendance may be required when there is a violation of the

negotiated settlement agreements are appropriate when the user has not previously entered into an administrative or civil consent decree or been found liable in a state or federal court for similar violations pursuant to ars  49 391c before a negotiated settlement becomes final the city shall provide a period of thirty 30 days for public comment as provided in c below penalty amount the proposed settlement will be determined using the procedures of setion 6 considering the penalty evaluation list and the penalty amounts sections 24c supplemental environmental project sep introduction the term supplemental environmental project sep refers to a project that may serve in addition to and in some cases in lieu of a monetary penalty as the basis for the settlement of an enforcement action in the settlement of a pretreatment violation the city may require the alleged violator to achieve and maintain compliance with federal state and local pretreatment regulations and to pay a civil penalty to further the citys goals to protect and enhance public health and the environment one or more seps may be included in a settlement agreement the following is a statement of policy by which the city will consider to accept an sep as part of or all of the settlement of an administrative enforcement action the city believes these projects provide a useful environmental benefit beyond what can be secured solely orders guidance for discretion the ultimate decision as to the settlement of an administrative enforcement action rests with the city of douglas city council the policies and procedures in this document are intended for the guidance of the city criteria for seps a judgment as to the appropriateness of an sep in a particular action will generally be made in accordance with the following criteria 1 benefit to the environment from sep seps will be allowed only when the city is satisfied that an sep will benefit the environment or promote public health or safety 2 planned completed or required activities an sep may not be allowed for projects which the violator has initiated prior to discovery of the violation projects that have been committed to or started before the identification of a violation or  1370  initiation of enforcement resolution discussions may mitigate the penalty in other ways 3 relationship to monetary penalty an sep may not replace damages a monetary penalty may still be necessary in order to assure that the citys enforcement actions are effective in deterring future violations by the violator or others in the regulated community penalties maintain a level playing field by ensuring that violators do not obtain an unfair economic advantage over their competitors who made the necessary expenditures to comply penalties encourage companies to adopt pollution prevention and recycling techniques so that they minimize their pollutant discharges and reduce their potential liabilities under the following circumstances the city may

the city determines there is a direct relationship between the nature of the violations and the environmental benefits to be derived from the sep alternatively the city council may approve an sep which while lacking a direct nexus to the violation either furthers the citys statutory mission or reduces the likelihood of future violations similar to those at issue the city prefers seps with a direct nexus to constitute a direct nexus the sep must 1 improve the environment injured by the violation  2 reduce the total risk posed to public health or the environment by the violation  3 result in the restoration of natural or manmade environments from the actual or potential damage resulting from the violation  or 4 protect natural environments from actual or potential damage resulting from the violation an indirect nexus may be consistent with this policy if it substantially furthers the citys statutory mission or reduces the likelihood of future violations similar to those at issue 6 initiation the proposal to do an sep may be initiated by either the violator or by the city the burden of developing the sep and convincing the staff of its benefits and likelihood of success are the responsibility of the violator an sep proposal may be made at any time during an enforcement action although the city should consider both the status of the action and the resources that have been

median & streetscape areas medians within commercial cores will be allowed a higher percentage of plant coverage with the plant materials for the area in which they are located 2 downtown and urban areas the downtown and urban classification is given to the areas of the city in which pedestrian comfort is a primary consideration when designing these areas concentration should be on elements such as arcaded walkways shade decorative paving and landscaping so that a comfortable setting can be created for this useintensive area the balanced use of plant material with decorative paving stamped concrete exposed aggregate pavers etc shall be effectively practiced to minimize the exposure of decomposed granite 3 suburban areas the suburban area applies to areas of the city where compatibility should be achieved between pedestrians and transportation routes within a medium density development pattern using trees that are native andor desert adapted and which achieve a broad dense canopy is encouraged for the main theme of the streetscape separating pedestrians from vehicular traffic can be accomplished areas and sidewalk alignment the use of decomposed granite exposed aggregate and grouted riprap in place of decorative paving shall be practiced with plant palette being used to incorporate more aridtype materials and desert adaptability 4 transitional arid areas for areas of the city where the development pattern is medium to low and the streetscape serves as a buffer between traffic and adjacent land uses the transitional arid classification is applied landscape materials should include native plants or plants compatible with a desert environment special care should be given to protect existing vegetation and natural features that can be incorporated into the design handset riprap and decomposed granite shall be the primary inorganic materials with plant palette consisting of indigenous and desertcompatible materials 5 natural areas a goal of the natural streetscape designation is to keep the streetscape compatible with the natural desert for this reason the design should use plants that are native to the upper sonoran desert and match densities to the existing and adjacent desert environment native stone and indigenous decomposed granite shall be primary inorganic materials with plant palette consisting of indigenous materials only and shall conform to the native distribution patterns densities and maturity 97 6 blending of abutting areas where two different landscape areas join a blending of the two categories should occur to prevent a marked difference between opposing sides of streets these guidelines apply to all landscaped areas within the public rightsofway areas between the rightsofway and building setback lines are encouraged to use the guidelines as well transitional areas which abut the natural areas should use native plants as the primary selection in order to strengthen the tie to the natural desert and to prevent the spread of invasive nonnative species into the natural areas b landscape guidelines all streetscape designs must meet the following minimum requirements based upon the citys ordinances 1 maintenance

median & streetscape areas medians within commercial cores will be allowed a higher percentage of plant coverage with the plant materials for the area in which they are located 2 downtown and urban areas the downtown and urban classification is given to the areas of the city in which pedestrian comfort is a primary consideration when designing these areas concentration should be on elements such as arcaded walkways shade decorative paving and landscaping so that a comfortable setting can be created for this useintensive area the balanced use of plant material with decorative paving stamped concrete exposed aggregate pavers etc shall be effectively practiced to minimize the exposure of decomposed granite 3 suburban areas the suburban area applies to areas of the city where compatibility should be achieved between pedestrians and transportation routes within a medium density development pattern using trees that are native andor desert adapted and which achieve a broad dense canopy is encouraged for the main theme of the streetscape separating pedestrians from vehicular traffic can be accomplished areas and sidewalk alignment the use of decomposed granite exposed aggregate and grouted riprap in place of decorative paving shall be practiced with plant palette being used to incorporate more aridtype materials and desert adaptability 4 transitional arid areas for areas of the city where the development pattern is medium to low and the streetscape serves as a buffer between traffic and adjacent land uses the transitional arid classification is applied landscape materials should include native plants or plants compatible with a desert environment special care should be given to protect existing vegetation and natural features that can be incorporated into the design handset riprap and decomposed granite shall be the primary inorganic materials with plant palette consisting of indigenous and desertcompatible materials 5 natural areas a goal of the natural streetscape designation is to keep the streetscape compatible with the natural desert for this reason the design should use plants that are native to the upper sonoran desert and match densities to the existing and adjacent desert environment native stone and indigenous decomposed granite shall be primary inorganic materials with plant palette consisting of indigenous materials only and shall conform to the native distribution patterns densities and maturity 97 6 blending of abutting areas where two different landscape areas join a blending of the two categories should occur to prevent a marked difference between opposing sides of streets these guidelines apply to all landscaped areas within the public rightsofway areas between the rightsofway and building setback lines are encouraged to use the guidelines as well transitional areas which abut the natural areas should use native plants as the primary selection in order to strengthen the tie to the natural desert and to prevent the spread of invasive nonnative species into the natural areas b landscape guidelines all streetscape designs must meet the following minimum requirements based upon the citys ordinances 1 maintenance
