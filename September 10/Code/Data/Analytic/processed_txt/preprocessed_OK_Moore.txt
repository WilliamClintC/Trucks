nature of the community and it is important how the individual subdivisions fit together to make up the community that is much of the reason for communitywide planning for physical features such as land use circulation systems community facilities and public utilities quality design of subdivisions is also important to the private economic sector because good design helps to sell developments in a competitive market saves development costs and increases profits because these areas have been considered in the processes that led to the general plan and the land use plan it shall be necessary for each subdivision to be designed in accordance with the principles of design established in the general plan and the land use plan and in accordance with the following general principles 1 it is intended that the city urban area should be designed as a group of integrated residential neighborhoods and appropriate commercial and industrial and public facilities the neighborhood a planning unit is intended as an area principally for residential use and of a size shopping facilities to serve the residents of the neighborhood should be provided and designed as an integral part of each neighborhood a each subdivision shall provide for the continuation of all arterial streets and highways as shown on the major street plan arterial streets should be located on the perimeter of the residential neighborhood  b minor streets shall be designed to provide access to each parcel of land within the residential neighborhood and within industrial areas and in a manner that will discourage use by they should be planned so that future urban expansion will not require the conversion of minor streets to arterial routes  c collector streets should be designed to provide a direct route from other minor streets to the major street system  d ingress and egress to residential properties should be provided only on minor streets  e pedestrian ways should be separated from roadways used by vehicular traffic sidewalks should be designed to provide all residential building sites with direct access to all neighborhood facilities including the elementary schools parks and playgrounds churches and shopping centers  and f minimum standards for development are contained in the zoning regulations however the general plan expresses policies which are intended to achieve optimum quality of development in the urban area if only the minimum standards are followed as expressed by the various ordinances regulating land development a standardization of development will occur this will produce a monotonous urban setting subdivision design should seek a quality to carry out the purpose and spirit of the policies expressed in the general plan and in these regulations rather than be limited to the minimum standards required herein 2 the size of lots and blocks and other areas for residential commercial industrial and public uses should be designed to provide adequate light air open space landscaping and offstreet parking and loading facilities 3 the arrangement of lots and blocks and the street system should be designed to make the most advantageous use of topography and natural physical features tree masses and large individual trees should be preserved the system of sidewalks and roadways and the lot layout should be designed to take advantage of the visual of the area 4 access to residential lots should be arranged from local streets if a development is platted with no lots having frontage orientation onto a collector street and with restrictive covenants prohibiting driveway access onto a collector street then the surface width of the collector street may be reduced to 32 feet ldc 199  12551  02 1222002 street design standards a conformity to comprehensive plan the arrangement character extent width grade and location of all streets shall conform to all of the elements of the comprehensive plan and shall be designed in accordance with the following provisions 1 major streets shall be planned to conform with the major street plan  2 whenever a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street the planning commission may require service streets reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line deep lots or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of arterial and local traffic  3 where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad rightofway or limited access highway rightofway the planning commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such rightofway at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of intervening land such distances also shall be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separation structures  4 reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where their control is placed in the city under conditions approved by the planning commission and acceptable to the subdivider  5 where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned or intended for development by the subdivider a tentative plan of a proposed future street system for the unsubdivided portion may be required by the planning commission  6 where a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or parcels such lots or parcels shall be arranged to permit the logical locations and opening of future streets and appropriate resubdivision with provision for adequate utility easements  7 no street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets street names shall be subject to the approval of the planning commission  8 minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by arterial traffic will be discouraged  9 streets shall intersect at approximately right angles b street jogs street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 200 feet shall be avoided c street rightofway widths street rightofway widths shall be in accordance with the land use plan and the general plan and where not designated therein shall conform with the following requirements the paved width of all streets shall be adequate to serve the existing and future estimated traffic load for the facility and shall

determination of stormwater runoff a general the rational method will be accepted as adequate for drainage areas up to 640 acres for larger areas other methods may be used the methodology developed by the us geological survey titled techniques for estimating flood discharges for oklahoma streams will be acceptable as adequate for drainage basins in excess of 640 acres other hydrographic models or methods may be approved by the city engineer the rational method is based on the following assumptions 1 the peak rate of runoff at any point is a direct function of the average rainfall intensity during the time of concentration to that point 2 the frequency of the peak discharge is the same as the frequency of the average rainfall intensity 3 the time of concentration is the time required for the runoff to become established and flow from the most remote part of the drainage area to the point under design the latter assumption applies to the part most remote in time not necessarily in distance in the rational method average intensities have no time sequence relation to the actual rainfall pattern during the storm the intensity duration curve is not a time sequence b rational method of runoff computation the rational formula is defined as follows q   cia where q   runoff volume in cubic feet persecond cfs a   area to be drained in acres ac c   runoff coefficient i   rate of rainfall over the entire drainage area in inches per hour based on the time of concentration 1 runoff coefficient c it should be noted that the runoff coefficient c is the variable of the rational method which is least susceptible to precise determination its use in the formula implies a fixed relation for any given drainage area which in reality is not the case a reasonable coefficient must be chosen to represent the integrated effects of infiltration detention storage evaporation retention flow routing and interception all of these affect the time distribution and peak rate of runoff

particular drainage basin or subbasin and is selected on the basis of design rainfall duration and design frequency of occurrence the design duration is equal to the time of concentration for the drainage area under consideration intensity duration curves for this region are included herein a the time of concentration used in the rational equation is the critical time of concentration for the point of interest the critical time of concentration is the time associated with the peak runoff from the watershed to the point of interest the time of concentration to any point in a storm drainage
