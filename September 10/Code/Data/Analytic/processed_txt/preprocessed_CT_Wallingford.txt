transform into a retail environment that offers a distinctive experience for consumers 3 to encourage smart growth and lowimpact development 4 to promote the development of a transitoriented pedestrianfriendly downtown community within walking distance to the wallingford stop on the springfieldnew haven commuter line it is recommended that the platform be located toward the northern end of the ihz to avoid traffic congestion on quinnipiac street and hall avenue during train stops 5 to assist the town of wallingford in complying with the state zoning enabling act connecticut general statutes  82 by adopting zoning regulations that promote housing choice and economic diversity including housing for moderate income households 6 to ensure high quality site planning architecture and landscape design that is consistent with the surrounding residential neighborhoods and the distinct visual character of the historic structures in downtown wallingford 7 to establish development standards that ensure contextsensitive design and creative site planning in the reuse of existing buildings and construction of new buildings 8 to benefit from the financial incentives provided by connecticut general statutes 813m et seq b location the boundaries of this ihz overlay district are shown on the wallingford zoning map the ihz overlay district is further divided into three subdistricts as shown on the map downtown core north cherry street and meadow street c applicability the regulations and design standards in this 423 shall apply to any proposed incentive housing development within the ihz overlay district 1 because the ihz overlay district is an overlay zone the provisions of the underlying zoning district shall not apply to a proposed incentive housing

includes 40 parcels with 40 existing buildings not including sheds and similar structures on 1001 acres of developable land as defined in general statutes  813m3 now or previously used for retail office industrial or residential this area has seen significant disinvestment in recent years and many buildings are in need of attention or have become obsolete many buildings in this area are single story creating a spread out land use pattern that is not conducive to pedestrian traffic by encouraging the use of vertical space in this compact area the vitality and livability of the downtown will be enhanced drawing more customers for businesses and increasing the tax base to that end the following principles shall be utilized for developing and reviewing incentive housing development proposals within the downtown core a promote a mix of uses with retail on the street level and office and residential uses above street level an increase in residential units providing round the clock population will help to reinvigorate the downtown core with activity including retail office and passive recreation b coordinate development with and encourage use by residents of the rail line stop that is located within the overlay district c maintain a design form in placement of buildings that will encourage walkability by placing buildings at or close to the edge of sidewalks that will with architecture and window displays at the street level promote visual interest d coordinate infrastructure and streetscape enhancements with the public sector and other developments within the district new development shall propose improvements to the public infrastructure including traffic controls sidewalks crosswalks street lighting underground utilities street trees and landscaping including window boxes and modest planters a welldesigned streetscape will contribute to a sense of safety and of the walkability of the area safe and convenient sidewalks leading to parking areas and other

subdistrict this area of the ihz includes three parcels with six existing buildings on 429 acres of developable land as defined in general statutes  813m3 all of which are industrial uses or are abandoned moving the train station platform to the north a sufficient distance from quinnipiac street and hall avenue to eliminate crosstown traffic congestion created by stopped trains would be beneficial therefore the intent of this subdistrict is to allow transit uses  primarily a new train platform and station which would serve the needs of the commuter rail as well as existing amtrak service  and to encourage residential uses and office and limited retail uses development on the west side of north cherry street is primarily residential and the goal is to create a neighborhood that provides a transition between those residential uses and the nonresidential uses to the east including the commuter rail facility the following principles shall be utilized for developing and reviewing incentive housing development proposals within the north cherry street subdistrict a promote a form of building placement and site design that creates a landscape that is somewhere between a village and an urban setting the three largest existing buildings in this subdistrict have the potential for adaptive reuse into residential units and applicants shall make use of the existing buildings to the extent practicable to the extent feasible new development shall be designed with setbacks consistent with shall not be located between the building and the street b coordinate

along the west side of the street in this subdistrict and any project within this subdistrict shall include construction of a sidewalk on the east side crosswalks street lighting and street trees a welldesigned streetscape contributes to an improved sense of safety and walkability which is critical in this subdistrict given the rail facility safe and convenient sidewalks leading to the train station as well as any other public spaces shall be part of the design for all projects and shall include ample lighting and landscaping where applicable wayfinding signage shall be installed that coordinates with an overall district wayfinding system to assist pedestrians and drivers in locating their destinations and public transit c promote creativity and variety in development the ihz design standards are meant to promote creativity and variety in building design given the limited size of this subdistrict a variety of building styles is not practical but if the three largest buildings are retained diversity will occur new development shall be designed to complement but not mimic the adjacent properties including the properties on the west side of north cherry street d promote sustainable and energyefficient design and construction sustainable construction techniques and materials shall to the extent applicable be incorporated into new construction and to the extent practicable renovation and rehabilitation projects energy efficiency shall be a central formatted indent left 15 first line 0 114 goal in selection of lighting windows materials insulation and hvac

developable land as defined in general statutes  813m3 there are currently nine units in the four residential buildings within this subdistrict and no other uses the parcels directly across meadow street and church street from this subdistrict are residential and the intent of this subdistrict is to maintain a residential character to that end nonresidential uses are not permitted under the ihz overlay zoning in this subdistrict the following principles shall be utilized for developing and reviewing incentive housing development proposals within the meadow street subdistrict a maintain a

picket fences are appropriate parking facilities shall not dominate the streetscape and such facilities shall have as little impact on the streetscape as possible b coordinate infrastructure improvements with the public sector as in the other subdistricts create an environment that is conducive to walking a sidewalk already exists along the street frontages in this subdistrict and any

this subdistrict to incorporate multiple building designs incorporate a variety of architectural details within the building design to add visual interest appropriate to a dense residential neighborhood d promote sustainable and energyefficient design and construction sustainable construction techniques and materials shall to the extent practicable be incorporated into new construction

due to site constraints a garage can only 142 reasonably be located adjacent to the street  in such case setbacks may be increased by the commission to allow for trees to be planted to provide visual
