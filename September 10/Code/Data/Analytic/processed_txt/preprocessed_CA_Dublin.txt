imposed amount of tax exemptions determination of land use collection use of tax proceeds appropriations limitation untimely or unpaid taxes administrative interpretation refundsimproved parcels refundsgrounds not specified  title this chapter shall be known as the ems tax of the city of dublin part  findings athe city council of the city of dublin does hereby determine that the cost to provide emergency medical services at a level required to provide for the health safety and general welfare of its residents exceeds the amount of funds and revenues generated from all other sources of income available for such purpose the city council does further determine that the imposition of an emergency medical services tax on occupants of real property throughout the city as set forth below is necessary to maintain an adequate level of emergency medical services bthe imposition of an emergency medical services tax will allow the city to provide a higher level of service than would otherwise be available to occupants of real property throughout the city currently the first unit to respond to a call for emergency medical services typically is a fire engine company or fire truck company staffed with personnel who have been trained as emergency medical technicians emts the emts can provide basic life support but cannot provide more advanced life support such as administering drugs or administering endotracheal intubation the average response time is currently ten 10 minutes before an ambulance with a paramedic who can provide advanced life support arrives on the scene the emergency medical services tax will enable the city to train and provide sufficient fire personnel as firefighterparamedics so that there will be a minimum of two firefighterparamedic companies on duty twentyfour 24 hours a day firefighterparamedics can provide advanced life support including administration of drugs and endotracheal intubation which emts are not authorized to perform by providing a minimum of two 2 firefighterparamedics on duty twentyfour 24 hours a day the city will reduce the average response time from ten 10 minutes to five 5 minutes before ambulance personnel who can provide advanced life support arrive on the scene cthe council recognizes that occupants of different categories of property use differing amounts of emergency medical services the tax rates established by this chapter are intended to be proportional to and based on estimates of typical use of and benefit from such services the rates are not tailored to individual use within categories of property both because such tailoring is not administratively feasible and because the city must make emergency medical services available to all occupants of property equally dthe tax is based on a benefit unit with different land uses assigned a different number of benefit units the weighted land use classification system was developed in 1983 by the alameda county emergency medical services district ems district and the alameda county assessor under this classification system benefit units were assigned to various land use types based on a countywide survey of the demand for service generated by the land use a singlefamily unit is one benefit unit because multiple family units in dublin have lower occupant densities than singlefamily units dublin general plan table 21 32 personsunit single family  20 personsunit multiple family the city finds it is appropriate to modify the weighted classification system developed in 1983 by the ems district and the assessor the tax on multiple family units is sixty 60% percent of the tax on a singlefamily unit which reflects the lower occupant densities of multiple family units nonresidential uses are assigned benefit units based on use ranging from two 2 to seven 7 eindividual occupants typically do not choose whether or when to avail themselves of emergency medical services which are relied on in emergencies or unexpected circumstances the value of such services is in their availability to all residents and it would be unfair to charge their costs only to those persons who actually use the services feach occupant of property derives value from the availability of emergency medical services even if such services are not presently used by an occupant they may be used in the future and in any event their availability benefits each occupant such services enhance the health safety welfare and environment of all occupants of property in dublin and improve their quality of life both directly and indirectly gparcels which are unimproved contain no occupants who may avail themselves of emergency medical services accordingly the council has determined that owners of unimproved parcels are not subject to the tax hparcels which are improved but vacant contain no occupants who may avail themselves of emergency medical services accordingly the council has determined that owners of vacant improved parcels may receive a refund of the tax if they can prove that the parcel was vacant for more than six 6 months iapproximately sixtynine percent 69% of dublins residential units are owneroccupied and approximately sixtysix percent 66% of all parcels are occupied by the property owner because these percentages are so high the overall tax impact is not significantly different if the tax is imposed on occupants as opposed to owners however nothing in this chapter is intended to preclude owners from recovering the tax from the occupant whether the occupant is charged depends solely on the occupancy agreement moreover nonpayment will not be a lien on the property but a personal obligation of the occupant or owner jit is not feasible for dublin to collect the tax from the nonowner occupants on whom it is imposed because the records available to the city do not include the names of nonowner occupants therefore the only practical way to collect a tax imposed on occupants is to collect it from the owners of the occupied properties kthe tax imposed by this chapter is a tax on the privilege of using and the use of emergency medical services it is not a tax on real property nor is it any other kind of tax on property or the ownership of property it is not a transaction or sales tax on the sale of real property finally because the tax proceeds are deposited in a special fund and the fund is restricted for emergency medical services the tax is a special tax part  definitions as used herein the following definitions shall apply emergency medical services shall mean and include salaries including benefits equipment and training required to provide basic and advanced life support to persons suffering medical emergencies occupant shall mean the person or persons who rent lease reside in or otherwise occupy the real property to which emergency medical services are available owner shall mean the owner or owners of the real property to which emergency

of the council be collected by alameda county in conjunction with and at the same time and in the same manner as the countys collection of property taxes provided that nothing herein shall be

affordable units if fees were paid in lieu of creating affordable units the credit may only be used to satisfy that portion of the obligation under the thencurrent inclusionary zoning regulations that may be satisfied by payment of fees in lieu of creation of affordable units by way of illustration if at the time a 40unit rental project was constructed the inclusionary zoning regulations required 5% of the units in the project to be affordable and the developer paid fees in lieu of constructing one affordable unit and built a moderateincome affordable unit to meet the projects obligations under the inclusionary zoning regulations then upon the event of a conversion of the 40unit project the converter would be entitled to a twounit credit against its inclusionary zoning obligations thus if the thencurrent inclusionary zoning regulations require that 125% of the units be affordable and provide that at least 75% of the units must be constructed then the converters inclusionary zoning obligation would be 3 units which is 5 units minus the twounit credit one unit of credit would be associated with the moderateincome affordable unit that would remain affordable as the other unit of credit was created by the payment of inlieu fees and is equal to 25% of the total units in the project only one unit of the remaining inclusionary obligation of 3 units could be satisfied payment of inlieu fees pursuant to the incomelevel allocations and rounding conventions set forth in section b the projects 3 affordable units are required to be distributed to the three income categories as

have been established for use by hazardous waste facility project proponents in locating and designing suitable facility sites and appropriate facilities and by the city in evaluating proposed sites and facility projects the purpose of the criteria is to reduce public health and environmental risks and governmental costs associated with development of offsite hazardous waste facilities aprotect the residents of alameda county and the city of dublin 1distance from residentially designated property all facilities treatment storage or transfer facilities handling ignitable explosive reactive or acutely hazardous wastes must provide a minimum buffer zone of at least 2000 feet between the nearest residential designated property and the facility site unless the developer can demonstrate by risk assessment and as part of the local permitting process that a smaller buffer zone provides adequate protection for the public in the event of an accident for other facilities including recycling transfer or storage of other types of hazardous wastes a buffer zone of at least 500 feet is required between the operational area within the facility site and the nearest residential designated property again unless the developer can demonstrate by risk assessment and as part of the local permitting process that a smaller buffer zone provides adequate protection for the public in the event of an accident 2distance from immobile populations all facilities facilities shall comply with city minimum zoning code setbacks unless a greater buffer distance from other uses is deemed necessary based on a required health and safety assessment larger buffer zones are required between a transfer station storage or treatment facility and any immobile populations where evacuation in the event of an accident at the facility is likely to be difficult or inadvisable this is especially true for facilities handling ignitable explosive or reactive waste a minimum buffer zone of 5000 feet between a facility site and any site with an immobile population is therefore required unless the developer can demonstrate by risk assessment and as part of the local permitting process that a smaller buffer zone provides adequate protection for the immobile population bensure the structural stability of the facility 1floodplains all facilities facilities must be designed constructed operated and

various uses in order to provide a mechanism to buffer potential negative visual impacts to determine the type of screening required type a b or c find the use in the developing use column which is similar to the proposed use to be developed and follow that line across the page to its intersection with the type of uses that adjoins the property to be developed for each intersecting square that contains a letter the developer is required to install the level of screening indicated 3types of screening the three basic types of screens that are required by table 721 are as follows aopaque screen type a a screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least six feet with intermittent visual obstruction trees or large plants from the opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet an opaque screen may be composed of a wall fence or densely planted vegetation compliance of planted vegetative screens will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation the opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year at maturity the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than 10 feet wide suggested planting patterns are shown in figure 721 bsemiopaque screen type b a screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of 3 feet with intermittent visual obstruction trees or large plants from above the opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet the semiopaque screen is intended to partially block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of the separation of spaces the semiopaque screen may be composed of a wall fence landscaped earth berm or planted vegetation compliance of planted vegetative screens will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation at maturity the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than 15 feet wide suggested planting patterns are shown in figure 721 cbroken screen type c a screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions from the ground to a height of at least 20 feet the broken screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces it may be composed of a wall fence landscaped earth berm planted vegetation or existing vegetation compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation the screen may contain deciduous plants suggested planting patterns are shown in figure 721 dinterpretation the screening requirements set forth in this section may be interpreted with some flexibility by the director of community development in the enforcement of standards it is recognized that because of the wide variety of types of developments and the relationships between them it is neither possible nor prudent to establish inflexible screening requirements therefore minor deviations may be granted to allow less intensive screening or requirements for more intensive screening may be imposed whenever such deviations are more likely to satisfy the intent of this separation of zoning districts where the side or rear yard of a use in a commercial or industrial zoning district abuts a residential zoning district those side or rear yards shall be screened from uses in that residential zoning district with an opaque screen type a 5separation of nonconforming uses whenever a residential lot is occupied by a nonconforming commercial or industrial use the side and rear yards shall be screened with an opaque screen type a table 721 screening requirements adjacent existing or permitted use  developing
