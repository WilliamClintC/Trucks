watercourses streets curbs and gutters and underground storm sewers manholes catch basins and culverts this systems purpose is to lessen or eliminate inconveniences and safety and health hazards associated with frequent storms except where indicated otherwise design criteria and requirements of this chapter are directed to the minor drainage system b a major drainage system for ensuring that stormwater runoff which exceeds the capacity of the minor drainage system has a route to follow that will not cause any loss of property or any loss of life it must be recognized that the major drainage system exists even when it is not planned and whether or not physical facilities are intelligently located in respect to it b rate of runoff 1developers are required to design improvements

detection and elimination program is to detect and eliminate illicit connections and illegal discharges to the storm drainage system illicit of improper connections to the storm drain system from industrial facilities commercial establishments and even residential property have been detected in many municipalities often illicit discharges are found in older industrial commercial and residential structures and buildings with the property owner unaware that sanitary wastewater is being improperly discharged into the storm drain occasionally these illicit connections are intentional illegal discharges via direct discharge or runoff to the storm sewer from industrial facilities commercial businesses and residents can be a significant source of water pollution for example illegal discharges may include chemical spills that flow to a gutter or creek the dumping of motor oil into the street or gutter or the discharge of wash water from restaurants to storm drains bthe objectives of the citys illicit discharge detection and elimination program are to 1detect and eliminate illicit connections to the storm drain system by conducting periodic field investigations and sampling 2correct conditions where sanitary sewer or storm drain piping has deteriorated causing seepage and infiltration into these systems 3detect and eliminate the illegal disposal of wastes to the storm drain system program that combines education alternative disposal options and enforcement cthis program is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance rule regulation or other provision of law the requirements of this program are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance rule regulation or provision of law where any requirement of this program imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance rule regulation or provision of law whichever requirement is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control passed 12505  5302 program elements the illicit discharge detection and elimination program includes the following elements afield investigation measures which includes but is not limited to spill and illegal discharge response storm drain outfall monitoring television tv camera inspections and dye testing  bline repairs and rehabilitation  ccorrective measures and enforcement procedures passed 12505  5303 field investigation measures afield investigation measures 1field investigations will be used to detect illicit connections and discharges site inspections and spill and illegal discharge response will be the primary methods used the city may also use tv camera inspections to help detect illicit detections other measures such as dye testing will be used in special circumstances or on an individual case basis 2city inspectors inspect all new and remodeled facilities during construction and upon completion in the inspection process inspectors ensure that all drains and pipes have been installed correctly and that all sanitary wastes are plumbed to the sanitary sewer bspill and illegal discharge response 1the city responds to all reports and complaints of spills and illegal discharges to the storm drain system as soon as possible field inspections and investigations will be conducted as a result of any of the following acomplaints received from the general public  bstaff observations of suspicious activities  cline blockages leaks or breaks  dphysical indications that a spill or illegal discharge has occurred 2storm drain inspections are generally conducted after a complaint or tip is received from a resident business or city staff occasionally storm drain inspections are conducted when city staff is working in the field and a suspicious discharge is noticed storm drains are checked in order to detect illegal discharges and track them back to their source these inspections may include visual inspection of storm drain outfalls drainage channels manholes and catch basins for signs of an illicit connection or discharge signs of an illicit connection may include but is not limited to adry weather flows  bexcessive wet weather flows  codors oil and grease or other pollutants  dunusual or unexplainable pipes or connections to the citys storm sewer system 3an illicit discharge inspection sheet is completed after each field investigation if a source of an illicit connection or discharge is identified the city will require termination of the violation and possibly corrective actions cstorm drain outfall monitoring the city periodically inspects creeks and drainage areas for any types of illicit discharges if levels of coli form bacteria are suspected the city will contact the hamilton county health department the health department will test and with the assistance of the citys stormwater utility and building departments try to determine the source of the contamination dtelevision tv camera inspection tv camera inspection is an excellent method used to assess the condition of underground pipes and to detect the presence of illegal connections periodically portions of the storm water system are inspected with a tv camera in specific situations such as when a road failure has occurred or there is a suspected problem in the pipes in these cases the underground photos are scrutinized for the presence of illegal connections to the storm drain system edye testing dye testing is a simple and lowcost method to determine which direction a sanitary or storm sewer line flows it may be used to determine if a drain flows to the storm drain or sanitary sewer typically a yellowred dye with running water is added to the drain in question and city staff monitor the downstream storm drain outlets or manholes for the appearance of dyed water sanitary sewer manholes are also opened to check for the dyed flow dye testing is generally conducted on an individual case basis use of this method is sometimes limited if the nearest accessible discharge point is far from the drain in question dye testing can require a high volume of water to carry the dye pipes passed 12505  5304 line repairs and rehabilitation deteriorating or leaking pipes in the sanitary or storm drain system may contribute to the urban runoff pollution in the citys waterways sanitary sewer and storm drain pipelines are often laid in close proximity to each other making them particularly susceptible to infiltration infiltration of sewage and other pollutants into the storm drain system occur as the underground pipes age developing cracks leaks and breaks pipes may also have structural failures which are repaired by the city or metropolitan sewer district as soon as they are detected a break in a sewer lateral or main can result in a direct discharge to a creek if a sanitary sewer line is suspected of leaking and infiltrating the storm system the metropolitan sewer district will be notified of the leak if a repair is needed to the storm sewer line the repair will be scheduled by the citys stormwater utility department passed 12505  5305 corrective measures and enforcement procedures aviolations of the storm water are placed in one of two categories 1illicit connections to the storm drainage system  2illegal dumping or discharges bif the city determines that a violation has occurred the city will contact the responsible party about the violation the responsible party or facility is then required to take appropriate corrective measures to eliminate any illicit connections or to cease the illegal discharge as soon as possible if the responsible party is a resident or private home the staff informs them about the storm water explaining why illegal discharges may be harmful to the environment the city prefers to focus on educational efforts to correct residential pollution problems rather than issuing written enforcement actions cthere are a wide variety of enforcement actions that may be taken by the city which include but are not limited to the following 1warning a warning specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred may consist of a verbal notice or a written informational letter to the property owner 2administrative action  notification of violation and citation a notification of violation is a written notice to the property owner or manager stating the nature of the violation of the code and a description of the corrective actions to necessary to restore compliance with this code in general violation letters state a date by which time the noncompliance must be corrected and may include a statement warning of additional enforcement actions including fines if the problem is not corrected 3administrative action  emergency termination the city may take steps to prevent or terminate an illegal discharge if the discharge presents an imminent threat of substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment any person notified of an emergency order under this action shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge in the event the discharger fails to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order the city may take steps necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the ms4 or waters of the united states andor endangerment to persons or to the environment 4summary abatement of certain nuisances a nuisance which is a menace to public health safety and welfare may be summarily abated or restored at the violators expense passed 12505  5306 program implementation this

stormwater utility department is primarily responsible for implementing the illicit discharge detection and elimination program the city will provide training for each employee who is directly involved in the program bthe public works department is responsible for maintaining the storm drain system the public works department crews spend a majority of their time in the field and therefore are valuable eyes for the program the crews may also investigate the cause of an illegal or suspicious discharge these illegal or suspicious discharges are reported to the stormwater utility department or fire department passed 12505  5308 right of entry for inspection athe citys inspector may request inspection of a facility whenever the director or any authorized representative of the city wishes to ascertain whether an industrial or commercial facility or a property owner is complying with the purposes and requirements of this program or has cause to suspect that a nuisance exists
