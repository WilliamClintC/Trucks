general offenses seven  business and taxation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  health and sanitation thirteen  planning and zoning fifteen  fire prevention seventeen  building and housing s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes chapters articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is self identifying as to code article and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the article number is 305 or the 5th article within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and article numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the article number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the article number is 113 or the 13th article within code 1 and the section number is10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes chapters and articles initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation articles are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains

concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 cfr 4036c bwhen the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the general manager may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users c when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the general manager shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr 4036e d a ciu may obtain a netgross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this section 1categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this section any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the south charleston sanitary board upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the requirements of paragraph 2 of this section are met 2criteria aeither i the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or ii the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters bcredit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere ccredit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this section dcredit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the south charleston sanitary board may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result e when converting such limits to concentration limits the general manager will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by see 40 cfr 4036d in addition the general manager will document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass limits or vice versa and make this information publicly available see 40 cfr 4036c7 f once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this   in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived g many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or 4day average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and

general manager within two 2 business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the
