fact a the flood hazard areas of santa fe are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage 3 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this section to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control

providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and g insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area 4 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this section uses the following methods a restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood

shall not be replaced the costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator vi unreasonable delays in allowing the city manager or hisher designee access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this a person who is the operator of a facility with a npdes or tpdes permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this vii if the city manager or hisher designee has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged and heshe is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this or that there is a need to inspect andor sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this or any order issued hereunder or to protect the overall public health safety and welfare of the community then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction 10 requirement to prevent control and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices the city will adopt policies identifying best management practices for any activity operation or

of the provisions of this article shall become liable to the city by reason of such violation of   c erosion and sediment control 1 introductionpurpose a during the construction process soil is the most vulnerable to erosion by wind and water this eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causes the silting of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of waterways in addition clearing grading during construction causes the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat and to provide a healthy living environment for citizens of the city b the purpose of this is to safeguard persons protect property prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in the city 2 permits it shall be unlawful for any person to conduct any land disturbing activity without a permit issued by the city manager or hisher designee i no person shall be granted a permit for land disturbing activity which would require the uncovering of one 1 acre or more without the approval of an erosion and sediment control plan by the city manager or hisher designee ii an erosion and sediment control plan is not required for the following activities a any emergency activity immediately necessary for the protection of life property or natural resources  or b existing nursery and agricultural operations conducted as a permitted main or accessory use iii each application for a permit to allow land disturbing activities shall include a statement that any land clearing construction or development involving the movement of earth shall be in accordance with the erosion and sediment control plan and that a site operator shall be on site on all days where construction or grading activity takes place 3 review and approval the city manager or hisher designee will review each erosion and sediment control plan to determine its conformance with the provisions of this local regulation the city manager or hisher designee shall in writing i approve the plan  ii approve the plan subject to such reasonable conditions as may be necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this regulation and issue the approval subject to these conditions  or iii disapprove the plan indicating the deficiencies and the procedure for submitting a revised application andor submission 4 design requirements grading erosion control practices sediment control practices and waterway crossings shall be adequate to prevent transportation of sediment from the site to the satisfaction of the city manager or hisher designee 5 modifications to the plan major amendments of the erosion and sediment control plan shall be submitted to the city manager or hisher

written authorization to the permittee 6 clearing and grading clearing and grading activities shall not be permitted except when in compliance all other chapters of this techniques that retain natural vegetation and retain natural drainage patterns shall be used to the satisfaction of the city manager or hisher designee 7 inspection a the city manager or hisher designee shall make inspections as hereinafter required and shall either approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee that the work fails to comply with the erosion and sediment control plan as approved plans for grading stripping excavating and filling work bearing the stamp of approval of the city manager or hisher designee shall be maintained at the site during the progress of the work b the permittee or hisher agent shall make regular inspections of all control measures in accordance with the inspection schedule outlined on the approved erosion and sediment control plans the purpose of such inspections will be to determine the overall effectiveness of the control plan and the need for additional control measures all inspections shall be documented in written form and submitted to the city manager or hisher designee at the time interval specified in the approved permit c the city manager or hisher designee shall enter the property of the applicant as deemed necessary to make regular inspections to ensure the validity of the reports filed under the above mentioned section 8 stop work order  revocation of permit in the event that any person holding a site development permit pursuant to this violates the terms of the permit or implements site development in such a manner as to materially adversely affect the health welfare or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood or development site so as to be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood the city manager or hisher designee may suspend or revoke the site development permit in addition to any other penalty provisions contained in this of   d post construction stormwater runoff 1 general provisions a findings of fact it is hereby determined that i land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition  ii this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants  and iii stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites therefore the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation it is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety b purpose the purpose of this is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction this seeks to meet that purpose following objectives i minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding silting increases in stream temperature and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels  ii minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality  iii minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the predevelopment hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable  and iv reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution wherever possible management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety c applicability this shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan applications unless eligible for an exemption by the city manager or hisher designee under the specifications of this the also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules in addition all plans must also ensure that established water quality standards will be maintained during and after development of the site and that post construction runoff levels are consistent with any local and regional watershed plans i to prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff the city has developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new development sites these standards apply to any construction activity disturbing one or more acres of land the following activities may be exempt from these storm water performance criteria a additions or modifications to existing single family structures  b developments that do not disturb more than one 1 acre of land provided they are not part of a larger common development plan  or c repairs to any stormwater treatment practice deemed necessary by the city manager or hisher designee ii when a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a redevelopment project as defined in this decisions on permitting and onsite stormwater requirements shall be governed by special stormwater sizing criteria found in the current engineering design specifications manual this criterion is dependent on the amount of impervious area created by the redevelopment and its impact on water quality final authorization of all redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the city manager or hisher designee d engineering design specifications manual the design specifications manual includes a list of acceptable stormwater treatment practices including the specific design criteria and operation and maintenance requirements for each stormwater practice the manual may be updated and expanded from time to time at the discretion of the city based on improvements in engineering science monitoring and local maintenance experience stormwater treatment practices that are designed and constructed in accordance with these design and sizing criteria shall meet the minimum water quality performance standards 2 permit procedures and requirements a permit required no landowner or land operator shall receive any of the building grading or other land development permits required for land disturbance activities without first meeting the requirements of this prior to commencing the proposed activity b application requirements unless specifically excluded by this any landowner or land operator desiring a permit for a land disturbance activity shall submit to the city manager or hisher designee a permit application on a form provided for that purpose 3 exemptions to stormwater management requirements exemptions for providing stormwater management are as follows a every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required by this unless a

requirements for stormwater management may be waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant provided that at least one of the following conditions applies i it can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this   ii alternative minimum requirements for onsite management of stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater management plan that has been approved by the city manager or hisher designee and the implementation of the plan is required by local ordinance  iii provisions are made to manage stormwater by an offsite facility the offsite facility is required to be in place to be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by onsite practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for longterm operation and maintenance of the stormwater practice  or iv nonstructural practices will be used on the site to reduce a the generation of stormwater from the site b the size and cost of stormwater storage and c the pollutants generated at the site these nonstructural practices will be explained in detail in the stormwater design manual and the amount of credit available for using such practices shall be determined by the city manager or his designee c in instances where one of the conditions above applies the city manager or hisher designee may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these stormwater management provisions as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided however to be eligible for a variance the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city manager or hisher designee that the variance will not result in the following impacts to
