construction during the fiscal year the application is made  2 the subject of an executed contract for the commencement of construction during the fiscal year the application is made  3 included in the capital improvements element of the city county or the state for the period set in the comprehensive plan  or 4 provided for in an enforceable development agreement approved by the city council d facilities 1 transportation the los shall be determined from table 1 appended to the annual capacity report if traffic count data is not given in table 1 for roadways impacted by the development an appropriate traffic count for that roadway link shall be prepared by the applicant in a manner approved by the planning director the traffic count will be subtracted from the capacity at los d or los c for i10 as shown in the table to determine available capacity the estimated number of trips generated by the proposed development shall be subtracted from the available capacity shown in table 1 to determine whether the roadway capacity is adequate to support the development and whether the final development order can be issued following each approval of a development order the cumulative total must be entered onto table 1 projects shall be listed in the order of approval dates of the application as shown on table 1 during the fiscal year the impact on the roadway network at the nearest point of connection to the system shall be determined by using the trip generation standards set forth in the institute of transportation engineers ite trip generation manual fourth edition set both in chapter 5 of the comprehensive plan and foundation document for nonresidential or mixed use developments a 100 percent buildout and occupancy will be assumed ite also provides a formula for passerby capture as a percentage of total trips on the pertinent roadway the total number of captured trips from all adjacent roadways shall not exceed 25 percent of the subject propertys total external trip potential any capture of trips from passing traffic in excess of these percentages and internal capture rate must be justified with supporting documentation to the satisfaction of the city planner the 1985 highway capacity manual and the 1988 florida department of transportation generalized level of service tables shall be used to determine maximum service flow rates and levels of service these may be found in chapter 6 of the foundation document notwithstanding the above for the purpose of issuing development orders if the number of trips generated by the development as determined by the above calculations would degrade the level of service by a roadway listed in table 1 then a detailed traffic study may be required by the planning director to determine if the impact will be significant the impact of a proposed development shall be determined insignificant if the number of trips generated on a roadway is a less than 25 average daily trips on a road segment  b if the development has its first point of contact with a roadway within onequarter mile of the deficient roadway or a potentially deficient road segment and would generate less than one percent of the total capacity of any such road segment a deficient roadway is one that is operating at or above 95 percent of the maximum service volume a failing roadway is one that is operating at a service level of f as determined by the fdot transportation generalized level of service  or c if the proposed development has its first point of contact with a roadway beyond onequarter mile of a deficient road segment or a potentially deficient road segment and would generate less than five percent of the capacity of any such road segment  d in any case where a deficient roadway is degraded from a service level of d to a service level of f all development shall be considered significant and prohibited until capacity is restored to the adopted level of service for the roadway involved 2 potable water

establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors to be known as the proportionate fairshare program as required by and in a manner consistent with fs  16 b applicability 1 the proportionate fairshare program shall apply to all developments in the city that have been notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency on a transportation facility in the city cms including transportation facilities maintained by fdot or another jurisdiction that are relied upon for concurrency determinations pursuant to the requirements of section 102106c 2 the proportionate fairshare program does not apply to a developments of regional impact dris using proportionate fairshare under fs  12 b developments exempted from concurrency as provided in section 102102g and section 102105d1 of these regulations andor fs   regarding exceptions and de minimis impacts c transportation improvements required for public safety onsite roadway improvements or offsite improvements otherwise required by these regulations for nondeficient roadway segments as determined by a traffic analysis c general requirements 1 an applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fairshare contribution pursuant to the following requirements a the proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations b the fiveyear schedule of capital improvements in the city cie or the longterm schedule of capital improvements for an adopted longterm cms includes a transportation improvements that upon completion will satisfy the requirements of the city transportation cms the provisions of section 102106c2 may apply if a project or projects needed to satisfy concurrency are not presently contained within the local government cie or an adopted longterm schedule of capital improvements 2 the city may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency proportionate fairshare program by contributing to an improvement that upon completion will satisfy the requirements of the city transportation cms but is not contained in the fiveyear schedule of capital improvements in the cie or a long term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted longterm cms where the following apply a the city adopts by resolution or ordinance a commitment to add the improvement to the fiveyear schedule of capital improvements in the cie or longterm schedule of capital improvements for an adopted longterm cms no later than the next regularly scheduled update to qualify for consideration under this section the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the city and determined to be financially feasible pursuant to fs  16b1 consistent with the comprehensive plan and in compliance with the provisions of this section financial feasibility for this section means that additional contributions payments or funding sources are reasonably anticipated during a period not to exceed ten years to fully mitigate impacts on the transportation facilities b if the funds allocated for the fiveyear schedule of capital improvements in the city cie are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the cms the city may still enter into a binding proportionate fairshare agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fairshare is calculated if the proportionate fairshare amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will in the opinion of the governmental entity or entities maintaining the transportation facilities significantly benefit the impacted transportation system the improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fairshare component must be adopted into the fiveyear capital improvements schedule of the comprehensive plan or the longterm schedule of capital improvements for an adopted longterm concurrency management system at the next annual capital improvements element update 3 any improvement project proposed to meet the developers fairshare obligation must meet design standards of the city for locally maintained roadways within the municipality those of the county for countymaintained roadways and those of the fdot for the state highway system d intergovernmental coordination pursuant to policies in the intergovernmental coordination element of the city comprehensive plan and applicable policies in the county the city shall coordinate with affected jurisdictions including fdot regarding mitigation to impacted facilities not under the jurisdiction of the local government receiving the application for proportionate fairshare mitigation an interlocal agreement may be established with other affected jurisdictions for this purpose e application process 1 upon notification of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency the applicant shall also be notified in writing of the opportunity to satisfy transportation concurrency proportionate fairshare program pursuant to the requirements of section 102106c 2 prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fairshare agreement a preapplication meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility application submittal requirements potential mitigation options and related issues if the impacted facility is on the sis then the fdot will be notified and invited to participate in the preapplication meeting 3 eligible applicants shall submit an application to the city that includes an application fee of $35000 and the following a name address email and phone number of owners

certify that the application is sufficient and complete within 15 business days if an application is determined to be insufficient incomplete or inconsistent with the general requirements of the proportionate fairshare program as indicated in section 102106c then the applicant will be notified in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies within 30 business days of submittal of the application if such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the written notification then the application will be deemed abandoned the city council may in its discretion grant an extension of time not to exceed 60 days to cure such deficiencies provided that the applicant has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure 5 pursuant to fs  16e proposed proportionate fairshare mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the sis requires the concurrency of the fdot the applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between the applicant and the fdot for inclusion in the proportionate fairshare agreement 6 when an application is deemed sufficient complete and eligible the applicant shall be advised in writing and a proposed proportionate fairshare obligation and binding agreement will be prepared by the city or the applicant with direction from the city and delivered to the appropriate parties for review including a copy to the fdot for any proposed proportionate fairshare mitigation on a state road no later than 60 days from the date at which the applicant received the notification of a sufficient application and no fewer than 14 days prior to the city council meeting when the agreement will be considered 7 the city shall notify the applicant regarding the date of the city council meeting when the agreement will be considered for final approval no proportionate fairshare agreement will be effective until approved by the city council 8 a public hearing shall be required for any proportionate fair share improvement that is suggested for addition to the capital improvement program f determining proportionate fairshare obligation 1 proportionate fairshare mitigation for concurrency impacts may include without limitation separately or collectively private funds contributions of land and construction and contribution of facilities 2 a development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fairshare the fair market value of the proportionate fairshare mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation 3 the methodology used to calculate an applicants proportionate fairshare obligation shall be as provided for in fs  12 as follows the cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being approved divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume msv of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted los multiplied by the construction cost at the time of developer payment of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted los or proportionate fairshare   s{development trips sub sub sv increase sub sub   cost sub sub } where development trips sub sub    those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment i and have triggered a deficiency per the cms  sv increase sub sub    service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment i per section e  cost sub sub    adjusted cost of the improvement to segment i cost shall include all improvements and associated costs such as design rightofway acquisition planning engineering inspection and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred 4 for the purposes of determining proportionate fairshare obligations the city shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the cie the mpotip or the fdot work program where such information is not available improvement cost shall be determined using one of the following methods a an analysis by the city of costs by cross section type that incorporates data from recent projects and is updated annually and approved by the city council  or b the most recent issue of fdot transportation costs  as adjusted based upon the type of crosssection urban or rural  locally available data from recent projects on acquisition drainage and utility costs  and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events cost estimates for state road improvements not included in the adopted fdot work program shall be determined using this method in coordination with the fdot district  or in order to accommodate increases in construction material costs project costs as determined from florida dot or local agency construction cost estimates shall be adjusted based on the following formula cost n   cost 0  cost growth 3yr n where cost n   the cost of the improvements in year n  cost 0   the cost of the improvement in the current year  cost growth 3yr   the growth rate of costs over the last three years  n   the number of years until the improvement is constructed the threeyear growth rate is determined by the following formula cost growth 3yr   cost growth 1 + cost growth 2 + cost growth 3 3 where cost growth 3yr   the growth rate of costs over the last three years  cost growth 1   the growth rate of costs in the previous year  cost growth 2   the growth rate of costs two years prior  cost growth 3   the growth rate of costs three years prior 5 if the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the applicant then the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section 6 if the city has accepted rightofway dedication for the proportionate fairshare payment credit for the dedication of the nonsite related rightofway shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 115 percent of the most recent assessed value by the county property appraiser or at the option of the applicant by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city the applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a warranty deed at no expense to the city if the estimated value of the rightofway dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the city estimated total proportionate fairshare obligation for that development then the applicant must also pay the difference prior to purchase or acquisition of any real estate or acceptance of donations of real estate intended to be used for the proportionate fairshare public or private partners should contact the fdot for essential information about compliance with federal law and regulations g impact fee credit for proportionate fairshare mitigation 1 proportionate fairshare contributions shall be applied as a credit against impact fees to the extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fairshare mitigation is used to address the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by the local governments impact fee ordinance 2 impact fee credits for the proportionate fairshare contribution will be determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development impact fees owed by the applicant will be reduced per the proportionate fairshare agreement as they become due per the city impact fee ordinance if the applicants proportionate fairshare obligation is less than the developments anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee amount to the city pursuant to the requirements of the city impact fee ordinance 3 major projects not included within the local governments impact fee ordinance or created under section 102106c2 a and b which can demonstrate a significant benefit to the impacted transportation system may be eligible at the local governments discretion for impact fee credits 4 the proportionate fairshare obligation is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed development at a specific location as a result any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate fairshare contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other location unless provided for within the local impact fee ordinance h proportionate fairshare agreements 1 upon execution of a proportionate fairshare agreement agreement the applicant shall receive a certificate of concurrency approval and all trips attributable to the development shall be considered vested and shall be added to the concurrency management tracking system for the impacted facilities should the applicant fail to be approved by the city council for a development order within 12 months of the execution of the agreement then the agreement shall be considered null and void the trips shall be removed from the cms and the applicant shall be required to reapply 2 payment of the proportionate fairshare contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be nonrefundable if the payment is submitted more than 12 months from the date of execution of the agreement then the proportionate fairshare cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment pursuant to section 102106f and adjusted accordingly 3 all developer improvements authorized under this section involving dedications to the city must be completed prior to final acceptance of the improvements and receipt of a defect security or as otherwise established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements 4 all developer improvements authorized under this section not involving dedications to the city must be completed prior to recording of the plat for residential developments or prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for nonresidential development 5 dedication of necessary rightofway for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fairshare agreement must be completed prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat 6 any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order may be subject to additional proportionate fairshare contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic that would require mitigation 7 applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fairshare agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement the application fee and any associated advertising costs to the city will be non refundable 8 the city may enter into multiparty proportionate fairshare agreements for selected corridor improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility i appropriation of fairshare revenues 1 proportionate fairshare revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the city cie or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fairshare agreement at the discretion of the local government proportionate fairshare revenues may be used for operational improvements prior to construction of the capacity project from which the proportionate fairshare revenues were derived proportionate fairshare revenues may also be used as the 50 percent local match for funding under the fdot trip 2 in the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the cie then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridor or sector that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of section 102106c2b 3 where an applicant constructs a transportation facility that exceeds the applicants proportionate fairshare obligation calculated under section 102106f the city shall reimburse the applicant for the excess contribution using one or more of the following methods a an impact fee credit account may be established for the applicant in the amount of the excess contribution a portion or all of which may be assigned and reassigned under the terms and conditions acceptable to the city b an account may be established for the applicant for the purpose of reimbursing the applicant for the excess contribution with proportionate fairshare payments from future applicants on the facility c the city may compensate the applicant for the excess contribution or some combination of means acceptable to the city and the applicant j proportionate share program for tceas tcmas and mmtds  if the city has implemented the concept of transportation concurrency management areas as described in fs  7 or multimodal transportation districts as described in fs  15 or transportation concurrency exception areas as described in fs  5 then the city may establish a proportionate fair share assessment within said districts based on the expected costs and transportation benefits of all the programmed improvements within that district and based on the expected trip generation of the proposed development k cross jurisdictional impacts 1 in the interest of intergovernmental coordination and to reflect the shared responsibilities for managing development and concurrency the city may enter an agreement with one or more adjacent local governments to address cross jurisdictional impacts of development on regional transportation facilities the agreement shall provide for application of the methodology in this section to address the cross jurisdictional transportation impacts of development 2 a development application submitted to the city subject to a transportation concurrency determination meeting all of the following criteria shall be subject to this section a using its own concurrency analysis procedures the city concludes that the additional traffic from the proposed development would use five percent or more of the adopted peak hour los maximum service volume of a regional transportation facility within the concurrency jurisdiction of the adjacent local government impacted regional facility  and b the impacted regional facility is projected to be operating below the level of service standard adopted by the adjacent local government when the traffic from the proposed development is included 3 upon identification of an impacted regional facility pursuant to 102106k2a or b the city shall notify the applicant and the affected adjacent local government in writing of the opportunity to derive an additional proportionate fairshare contribution based on the projected impacts of the proposed development on the impacted adjacent facility a the adjacent local government shall have up to 90 days in which to notify the city of a proposed specific proportionate fairshare obligation and the intended use of the funds when received the adjacent local government must provide reasonable justification that both the amount of the payment and its intended use comply with the requirements of fs  16 should the adjacent local government decline proportionate fairshare mitigation under this section then the provisions of this section would not apply and the applicant would be subject only to the proportionate fair share requirements of the city b if the subject application is subsequently approved by the city the approval shall include a condition that the applicant provides prior to the issuance of any building permit covered by that application evidence that the proportionate fairshare obligation to the adjacent local government has been satisfied the city may require the adjacent local government to declare in a resolution ordinance or equivalent document its intent for the use of the concurrency funds to be paid by the applicant 4 where an impacted regional facility has been designated as a regionally significant transportation facility in an adopted regional transportation plan as provided in fs   the city may coordinate with other impacted jurisdictions and agencies to apply proportionate fairshare contributions and public contributions to seek funding for improving the impacted regional facility under the fdot trip such coordination shall be ratified by the city interlocal agreement that establishes a procedure for earmarking of the developer contributions for this purpose  10906 secs 102107102115  reserved article vii  land use type density intensity zoning and regulatory controls

permitted are correlated with the districts shown on the future land use map  101496 land use districts density and intensity land use categories and adopted densities and intensities are as described below density is the number of residential dwelling units permitted per acre  intensity is a measurement of how much of a building site can be utilized by structures in nonresidential developments density is determined by dividing the total number of dwelling units by the total site area less rightofway intensity is determined by calculating floor area ratios far far is the relationship between the total floor area of a proposed structure or building and the gross area of the building site maximum fars are obtained by subtracting setback parking and landscaping requirements from a building site net area and then dividing this number by the gross area of the building site an example of calculating far is found in the future land use chapter of the foundation documents ldr means low density residential development up to and including 60 dwelling units per gross acre mdr means medium density residential development up to and including 150 dwelling units per gross acre hdr means

performance standards density and intensity bonuses a generally innovative arrangements of development are encouraged to achieve more efficient densities and intensities provided the arrangement is compatible with the established character of a community planned development units puds for example are usually land areas where development is planned as one integral whole with a mix of housing commercial and institutional land uses designed in such a manner as to maximize open space techniques and combine living shopping and working space puds and other innovative land development technique approaches to mixed use development are therefore promoted and encouraged policy 7a82 developers who wish to obtain density and intensity bonuses may so qualify if the application submitted for a
