monopoles on the county rightofway over the past year many of the cities that we represent have been approached by communication companies seeking to locate cell towers on the rightofway in the county as previously stated the georgia general assembly and the united states congress have attempted to restrict the regulation of these communication facilities by local governments while the ability to regulate these facilities is limited should you have no ordinance at all communication companies would be free to place these facilities where ever they liked consequently the county should consider this ordinance as soon as practicable thank you for your consideration of this important matter i look forward to discussion of this matter with you and members of the commission in the coming weeks
