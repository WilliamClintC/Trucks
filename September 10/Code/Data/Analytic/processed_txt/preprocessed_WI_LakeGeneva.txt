public safety and there is a need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law near schools and daycare facilities the city finds and declares that in addition to schools and daycare facilities children congregate or play in a number of other public places including public parks and other facilities for children b the city council is aware that sex offenders have dramatically higher recidivism rates than any other type of violent felon and according to 1997 and 2003 reports by the united states department of justice sex offenders are the least likely to be cured and the most likely to reoffend and prey on the most innocent members of our society and more than 2 3 of the victims of rape and sexual assault are under the age of 18  and c the city council knows that the united states supreme court has recognized that the risk of recidivism posed by sexual offenders is frightening and high and when convicted sex offenders reenter society they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault smith v doe 538 us 84 123 sct 1140 155 led 2d 164 2003 and mckune

providing in part the record does not support a conclusion that the iowa general assembly and the governor acted biased merely on negative attitudes toward fear of or a bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group citation omitted sex offenders have a high rate of recidivism and the parties presented expert testimony that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk for individuals to reoffend even experts in the field could not predict with confidence whether a particular sex offender will reoffend whether an offender convicted of an offense against a teenager will be among those who crossover to offend against a younger child or the degree to which regular proximity to a place where children are located enhances the risk for individuals to reoffend against children one expert in the district court opined that it is just common sense that limiting the frequency of contact between sex offenders and areas where children are located is likely to reduce the risk of an offense citation omitted the policymakers of iowa are entitled to employ such common sense and we are not persuaded that general provisions 271 definitions as used in

and intensity regulations purpose the purpose of this to indicate the maximum permitted density for residential projects and maximum permitted intensity for nonresidential projects of development on any given site within the jurisdiction of this see  the development potential of any site is determined by a variety of factors including but not limited to 1 the area of the site  2 the proportion of the site not containing sensitive natural resources  3 the zoning districts in which the site is located  4 the development options the site is developed under  and 5 the uses considered for development rationale this the development potential of all property within the jurisdiction of this designed to ensure the implementation of many goals and objectives of the city of lake geneva comprehensive master plan see also of this  many of these are extremely difficult to address using conventional zoning techniques particularly those which rely on minimum lot area requirements to establish maximum permitted residential densities and maximum floor area ratios to establish the character of nonresidential developments such approaches provide for a minimum flexibility of site design options which in turn results in land use inefficiencies forced site planning andor the needless destruction of sensitive natural resources the approach employed by this relying on maximum gross densities mgds and minimum green space ratios gsrs for residential development and minimum required landscape surface ratios lsrs in combination with maximum permitted floor area ratios fars for nonresidential development both in conjunction with a variety of development options available in every zoning district results in a very high degree of site design flexibility and the protection and implementation of desired community character and adopted community goals how to use this the standards which determine the maximum amount of development permitted on any given site prior to using the provisions of this determine the development potential of a given property the guidelines provided by 1 though 3 should be reviewed this inherent differences between residential and nonresidential

other land use activities these resources include floodways floodplain areas floodfringe shorelands wetlands drainageways lakeshores steep slopes and woodlands these resources are fully defined in  these resources serve important functions which are lost when these areas are subject to development andor other land use activities in the absence of correct mitigation approaches in many instances these functions cannot be provided by other natural or manmade features specific broad categories of such functions include the protection and enhancement of air surface water and soil quality  habitat provision and diversification  aesthetic diversification  and buffering effects 2 mitigation in certain instances natural features can accommodate development andor other land use activities

should be compared with the required resource protection area rpa required on the subject property as determined under the natural resource site evaluation in step c above if the area of the site containing sensitive natural resources exceeds the area of permanently protected landscape surface required then more floors may have to be used in order to approach maximum development potential on the site in other words if the rpa from c is greater than the lsr the use of more floors may permit the development of more floor area on the subject property d determine maximum floor area ratio

environmental functions which woodlands provide see landscaping requirements for bufferyards 1 purpose this the landscaping and width requirements for bufferyards on lots developed after the effective date of this chapter see  a bufferyard is a combination of distance and a visual buffer or barrier it includes an area together with the combination of plantings berms and fencing that are required to eliminate or reduce existing or potential nuisances these nuisances can often occur between adjacent zoning districts such nuisances are dirt litter noise glare of lights signs and incompatible land uses buildings or parking areas rationale one of zonings most important functions is the separation of land uses into districts which have similar character and contain compatible uses the location of districts is supposed to provide protection but in the city of lake geneva this is not the case since zoning districts permitting uses as diverse as singlefamily residential and industrial uses were located next to one another long before the effective date of this chapter bufferyards will operate to minimize the negative impact of any future use on neighboring uses 2 required locations for bufferyards bufferyards shall be located along and within the outer perimeter of a lot wherever two different zoning districts abut one another bufferyards may be located in required setback areas in such instances the onehalf of the bufferyard requirements of this be used instead of the street frontage landscaping required in if such requiremetns fo this greater in such instances the width of the rightofway may be counted as constributing to the width requirements for a bufferyard however the minimum width required along the street frontage by shall be provided in all cases bufferyard plantings or structures shall not be located on any portion of any existing dedicated or officially mapped rightofway 3 determination of required bufferyard the determination of bufferyard requirements is a twostaged process first the required level of bufferyard opacity is determined using table 986104a opacity is a quantitativelyderived measure which indicates the degree to which a particular bufferyard screens the adjoining property the required level of opacity indicated by this table is directly related to the degree to which the potential character of development differs

development of which signs are a primary contributor so as to be respectful of the reasonable rights of other advertisers and business entities whose messages are also displayed in such areas

purposes for which the regulation was initially imposed each zoning regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and the general public each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable potential negative impact a sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured without careful analysis of the regulation and the end toward which it is directed it is understood that there may be other public purposes underlying the interpretation which are not explicitly articulated b articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations permitting flexibility in design and prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public rationale there is a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use and an interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use or which allows a use to be enlarged or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in the freedom is to be encouraged while a lowering of the standards of this to be prohibited c determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected by that persons land use proposal rationale if an interpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from the one expressly stated or permitted and if it would result in a same or greater degree of protection to any affected party either the adjoining landowners the public at large andor a future property owner or renter such an interpretation may be appropriately made any interpretation which would result in any identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this any interpretation which would either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the regulation was adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this interpretation which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted shall only be
