following floodplain management ordinance art 1  a 91409 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city of mayfield are subject to periodic inundation which result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity and by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage art 1  b 91409 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other areas art art 1  c 91409 objectives the objectives of this article are to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of

extent possible art 5  g 91409 appeals and variance procedures a nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this article would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this article are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b designation of variance and appeal board the city council of the city of mayfield shall establish an appeal board consisting of the board of zoning adjustments c duties of variance and appeals board 1 the appeal board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this article and appeals of decisions or determinations made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article 2 any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local district court as provided in kentucky revised statutes d appealsvariance procedures in passing upon such applications the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors all standards specified in other sections of this article and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility  5 necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront in the case of functionally dependent facility  6 availability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected height velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water systems streets and bridges e conditions for variances upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article 1 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 2 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this article for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 3 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard in the instance of an historical structure a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure 4 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant as defined in this article  and c a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height additional threats to public safety cause extraordinary public expense create nuisance as defined in the definition section under public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization of the public as defined in the definition section or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 5 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation 6 the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency fema and the federal insurance administration fia upon request 7 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsection 463d111 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance f variance notification any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the city of mayfield recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 3 the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in the communitys biennial report submission to the federal emergency management agency g historic structures variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures see definition upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure h no impact certification within the floodway variances shall not be issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result art 6 91409 secs 461469  reserved article

iv  adult entertainment division 1  generally findings declaration of public policy and purpose a the council finds it has been the experience of other communities as well as this one that certain adult entertainment activities which are located near areas zoned for residential use near schools and public parks and near malls and similar open spaces that cater to use by family groups and children adversely affect the viability of such nearby properties for their described purposes b local governments in mayfield the commonwealth of kentucky and the united states government have spent millions of dollars on community development and neighborhood enhancement projects within the recent past to eliminate blight and to prevent the further deterioration of mayfield neighborhoods c the

city clerk freedom and justice center for prostitution resources minneapolis minnesota based on cases and reports such as these the council finds 1 sexually oriented adult entertainment businesses as a category of commercial uses are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including but not limited to personal and property crimes prostitution potential spread of disease lewdness public indecency obscenity illicit drug use and drug trafficking negative impacts on property values urban blight pornographic litter and sexual assault and exploitation 2 sexual acts including masturbation oral and anal sex sometimes occur at unregulated adult entertainment businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths rooms or cubicles for view films videos or live sexually explicit shows which acts constitute a public nuisance and pose a risk to public health spread of sexually transmitted diseases 3 adult entertainment businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses and should be separated from other certain uses such as other sexually oriented businesses and establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent a concentration of sexually oriented businesses and such uses 4 each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the council has a substantial government interest in abating andor preventing in the future e adult entertainment activity tends to attract an undesirable clientele which discourages neighboring residents from undertaking civic improvements causes residents and businesses to move elsewhere and frustrates attempts to attract new residences and businesses to come into an area all of which factors contribute to a diminution of property values and to a general deterioration of neighborhoods f the small closetlike rooms or booths at adult amusement arcades in mayfield and other communities have encouraged persons to loiter for the purposes of engaging in unlawful often anonymous sexual conduct and have encouraged lewd conduct in public places thereby creating public nuisances and generally unsanitary and unhealthful conditions that create dangers to the public health welfare and safety g the concentration of sexually explicit movies and books and sexual paraphernalia in adult entertainment establishments which also house sexually explicit movies as well as hotel rooms rented by the hour to couples afforded free sexually explicit movies in the hotel room have provided prostitutes an appealing and visible meeting place to ply their trade and have created public nuisances in otherwise respectable neighborhoods h children the family environment and residential neighborhoods suffer injury from the deleterious effects and harmful consequences resulting from the distribution of and exposure to certain sexually explicit items and devices this is particularly so when such items and devices are permitted to leave a businesss premises and litter the immediate family environment neighborhood and certain areas where children are likely to be i the noise generated by patrons coming and going from adult entertainment establishments causes a substantial disruption to nearby residents and modest curtailment of the hours during which entertainment is offered to patrons of such establishments would afford some relief to persons living in those nearby residences without significantly interfering with the availability of adult entertainment j nationally there is extensive involvement of organized crime in the business of adult bookstores and the disclosure of persons who own as well as the names of those persons who operate adult bookstores and other adult entertainment establishments will aid law enforcement officials in the enforcement of the federal racketeer influences and corrupt organizations act rico and the enforcement of the laws of the commonwealth of kentucky among others prohibiting the distribution of obscene matter the use of minors to distribute obscene matter the

sexual performance by a minor the promoting of material portraying a sexual performance by a minor and the advertising of material portraying a sexual performance by a minor and the use of minors to

deterioration of the neighborhoods of mayfield protect property values promote the return of residents and businesses to the neighborhoods protect children from the deleterious effects of exposure to
