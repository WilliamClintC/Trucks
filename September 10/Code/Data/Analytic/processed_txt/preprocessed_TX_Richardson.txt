uses vulnerable to flood including public facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction 3 control the alteration of natural floodplains their protective barriers and stream channels 4 prevent the construction of barriers which will divert floodwaters and subject other lands to greater flood hazards 5 control development which would cause greater erosion or potential flood damage such as grading dredging and excavation 218 objectives the objectives of this chapter are 1 to protect human life and property exposed to the hazards of flood 2 to ensure that potential property owners are notified if property is in a special flood hazard area 3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public 4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions 5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas 6 to minimize expenditure of future public money for costly flood control projects 7 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas 219 lands to which this chapter applies this chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city 221 basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard the areas of special flood hazard identified by the federal emergency management agency in the scientific and engineering reports entitled the flood insurance study dallas county texas and incorporated areas with accompanying flood insurance rate maps dated  and the
