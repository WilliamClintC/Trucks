 special uses purpose the development and execution of this chapter is based upon the division of the city into districts within which districts the uses of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform it is recognized however that there are special uses which because of their unique characteristics cannot be properly classified in any particular district without consideration in each case of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location such special uses fall into three categories 1 uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest  and 2 uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities 3 a special use is a use which is requested by the public welfare but which is incompatible with the uses normally permitted in the zoning districts established herein it shall be deemed and determined by the planning and zoning commission and as further defined in this article it is declared the policy and purpose of this chapter to employ the special use as a flexible means of permitting certain exceptions to the districts established and the rules and regulations

selfsupportive tower tower is designed to collapse at the north leg at approximately 65 feet at grade level the remaining tower above 65 feet at grade level falls 130 feet out thus the tower would fall approximately up to 130 feet away from the centerline of the tower 2 guyed lattice towers typically fail at the guy wire anchoring system and in this case these fall like a tree the height of the tower is the collapse zone for this type of structure to ensure safety add ten percent of the overall height to the calculation and no development should happen within this area example a tower 300 feet above grade level with failure on a set of guy wires will fall in the opposite direction add ten percent equals to 30 feet total collapse zone 330foot radius 3 monopole towers are steel cylinder welded or molded to a base plate that is bolted to a concrete foundation in high winds ice loading and overloading of the structure itself with antennas and equipment the failure typically happens at the joint at the ground level and base plate example 150foot monopole falls it will fall at the base and thus the danger area would be 150 feet in a radius from the base a factor of safety of ten percent is typically added for safety in this example the overall collapse area is 150 feet plus 15 feet equals 165 feet federal communications commission fcc means an independent federal agency
