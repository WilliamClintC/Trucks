estuaries adopted 6302008  36045 interim regulations amended 2102009 purpose the findings of a statewide estuary investigation indicate that a substantial portion of the towns saltwater estuaries are in jeopardy from the longterm buildup of nitratenitrogen primarily from the subsurface discharge of sewage effluent these findings have caused the massachusetts department of environmental protection to establish total maximum daily loads tmdl for nitrogen for the watershed areas of these estuaries watershed is defined as the area of land from which water flows downhill into a particular body of water in these nitrogenimpaired estuaries the tmdl will require an actual reduction in the amount of nitratenitrogen discharged into these embayments since most of the nitratenitrogen in these watersheds is from subsurface discharge of sewerage effluent into the groundwater that flows to these embayments and since it is likely that a plan for corrective action will take years to formulate and implement the board is adopting the following interim regulations to mitigate the adverse impact to these estuaries from such discharges the town has long recognized the need to protect its water resources and has imposed discharge limits on subsurface disposal of sewage in other nitrogensensitive areas the restrictions proposed herein are similar to those imposed by town ordinance andor board of health regulation in other nitrogen sensitive areas in the town these regulations are temporary and will be in effect only until the town adopts and implements a comprehensive plan to address the nitrogen reduction required in these estuary systems by the proposed tmdl 1 to date final reports have been produced for popponesset bay three bays and the centerville river watersheds all three of these estuary systems will require a reduction in total nitrogen discharge in order to meet the statemandated tmdl further reports are expected on lewis bay and barnstable harbor 2 a restrictions no permit for the construction of an individual sewage disposal system on any building lot shall be granted within the watersheds for the estuaries that have been identified as requiring a reduction in the current tmdl of nitratenitrogen as identified by the map entitled massachusetts estuary project zones of contribution to saltwater estuaries town of barnstable  unless the following standards are met the maximum allowable discharge of sanitary sewage based on the sewage design flow criteria listed in 310 cmr  title 5 1 b  36045 massage establishments  36045  of the state environmental shall not exceed 440 gallons per 40000 square feet of lot area with the following exceptions for approved building lots on which no building currently exists and that are less than 30000 square feet in area the maximum allowable sewage discharge shall be 330 gallons a for parcels with existing buildings the maximum allowable flow shall be either 440 gallons per 40000 square feet except as described in 1a above or whatever is currently permitted whichever is greater b nothing in this regulation shall prohibit the approval by the board of health of any application involving the maintenance repair or alteration of an existing individual sewage disposal system provided that said application does not involve an increase in design flow as defined by existing board of health regulations where an increase in design flow is involved the applicant must demonstrate compliance with this regulation 2 variances a variance from this regulation may be granted by the board of health only if the applicant can demonstrate that 1 connection to town sewer is not available  and 2 that enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice  and the alternative proposal will provide the same degree of environmental protection as a design in full conformance with this regulation this standard shall be met by a siteseptic design which results in equilibrium concentrations of nitratenitrogen at the downgradient property line not exceeding five ppm utilizing the cape cod commission formulas found in its technical bulletin 91001 final in undertaking this calculation the applicant may utilize offsite lands located elsewhere in the estuaries contribution area as defined by the map entitled massachusetts estuary project zones of contribution to saltwater estuaries town of barnstable  provided that the existing nitrogen loading for the offsite property is included in the calculations  and a a deed restriction limiting the offsite property to the current nitrogen loading as stated

items in the operating budget the capital improvements plan cip and the capital improvements budget should be developed following steps selection of projects forecasting of resources and determining the financing method determining worthwhile projects a public investment is desirable when the present value of its estimated flow of benefits discounted at the communitys cost of capital exceeds or equals its cost a public investment is also desirable when the project rates highly with community values the latter criteria may include but not limited to a preservation of capital  b legal conformance  c town goals and objectives  d health safety general welfare  e cost effectiveness  f environmental quality  g quality of life  h economic development  i financial leverage  and j special needs of the community 1 forecasting fiscal resources these resources should be projected in terms of normally anticipated sources of revenues normal 2 f  40127 wells  40127   40128 accounting reporting and auditing these policies and procedures are based on the premise that good accounting provides timely information as to when expenses will exceed budget plans when capital funds are diverted to operations when expenditures are outpacing revenues and when the local government is incurring financial obligations beyond its fiscal capacity expenditures and existing debt service obligations future revenues may be projected by studying past data on existing revenue sources projections should be based on existing tax rates and applied to a forecast of the growth of the existing tax base as with expenditure trends questions should be posed about significant deviations from past trends to learn whether special factors are likely to affect expenditure patterns in the future then the capital improvements budget should be formulated by detailing the costs of the selected projects for the next five years and should be summarized in a table including the following a a complete list of major capital improvements  b estimates of the total cost of each improvement  outside sources of financing such as state or federal grants and private gifts  and c d the scheduling of construction starts and annual expenditures determine financing method the next step in capital budget preparation is to develop a financial plan and its effects on the tax structure the plan should outline financing needs and recommended sources eg bonding fees grants etc 3 accounting standards standards for accounting are guided by gaap and are described by a subcommittee of the fasb as

and shellfisheries wildlife habitat erosion and sediment control and recreation construction maintenance and use of piers can have adverse effects on resource areas and on the use of these areas for recreational purposes further piers destroyed by storm pose a threat to nearby properties by increasing waterborne debris c turbulence such as caused by jetdrive boats and propeller dredging generated by boat use associated with piers significantly increase turbidity levels high turbidity levels attenuate light light is necessary for photosynthetic process responsible for the primary productivity and oxygen regeneration of the water the suspended sediments settle on shellfish beds smothering existing shellfish and altering the quality of the benthic environment essential for spat mollusk larvae settlement resuspension of bottom sediments causes redistribution of sediments alteration in sediment grain size distribution and causes changes in bottom topography relief elevation and grade including creation of depressions in the bottom settlement of sediments into depressions can create deep pockets of highly fluidlike sediment which may not be able to physically support shellfish or which can become anoxic and therefore not support shellfish disturbance of sediments during the period of shellfish larval settlement hinders or prevents the effective settlement of shellfish larvae boat traffic generated from piers will add to this disruption and may cause erosion of banks and marshes d construction of piers and subsequent boat activity causes resuspension of nutrientladen sediment particles which may cause a release of sedimentbound nutrients to the water column resulting in a bloom of vegetation release of nutrients to the water column leads to eutrophication and anoxic bottom conditions anoxic sediments and anoxic bottom conditions create adverse impacts on benthic resources including shellfish and fisheries e while pier construction is typically the least environmentally destructive method of crossing a marsh it may adversely affect the physical characteristics and functional value of marsh marsh plants provide the major energy flow detritus food chain between the autotrophic and heterotrophic levels in a marshestuarine system many species of sport and commercial fish and shellfish are dependent upon this system plants adapted to high ambient light intensity such as marsh grasses are illadapted to the shaded conditions created by a pier shading may result in the loss of vegetation biomass decreased plant height population density and leaf

construction setbacks from wetlands 35 feet and mhw in coastal areas and inland great ponds 50 feet by extending potential regulatory jurisdiction over proposed activity within the resource areas themselves and also within a onehundredfoot buffer zone landward of such areas when activity may elicit a deleterious resource area impact the foregoing statute regulations a  7035 barnstable code  7040  and ordinances provide the conservation commission with a meaningful set of tools for protecting the longterm integrity of areas under its jurisdiction prevention of pollution the role that a protective buffer zone plays in the maintenance of viable wetland resource areas has been frequently discussed in the scientific literature omernik 1977 thoroughly documented the dramatic increase in nitrogen and phosphorous loading to wetlands and waterbodies as their adjacent watersheds are cleared water quality it was demonstrated can be better maintained if protective buffer strips are preserved along stream edges 1 as surface runoff from developed sites flows toward a wetland resource area the buffer zone can provide a site where eroded sediments settle where nutrients from fertilizers are adsorbed onto soil elements and where transition zone vegetation can uptake unbound nutrients preventing nuisance algal blooms in adjacent waters harris and gosselink 1989 2 nutrients are by no means the only pollutant which may degrade wetland resource areas surface runoff from developed sites carries a diverse and potent pollution load hydrocarbons lawn chemicals metals bacteria and viruses are common constituents diamond and nilson 1988 while it has been demonstrated that wetlands can play an effective role in cleansing pollutant loads nickerson 1978 little is known of the assimilative capacity of wetland systems in accommodating the broad spectrum of nonpoint pollutants in a given watershed indeed evidence of our swamping of the natural thresholds for wetland resiliency abound 3 b wildlife the transitional assemblage of trees shrubs and ground cover containing both wetland and upland elements frequently found in buffer zones has been found significant to the support of a greater number of native and specialist wildlife species in the interior of resource areas which they border put another way similar habitats provide a gradual transition zone that is not as inhospitable as an abrupt habitat edge harris 1984b it seems that the relationship between the width of the transitional buffer zone along a bordering marsh for example and the provision of optimum wildlife habitat for its native marsh fauna is a proportional one on the other hand more common edge species including many opportunistic exotics and generalists may find their habitat proportionately diminished c cumulative effects cumulative effects are defined and discussed in wetlands protection of the the town of barnstable cumulative effects result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time council on environmental quality 1978 while provides that the commission may deny any project that will have a significant d  7040 roller skates and skateboards  7040  cumulative effect on a wetland or its values our permitlevel activities ie site disturbance are difficult to measure on the scale of cumulative impacts ie watersheds gosselink and lee 1989 thus techniques employed for individual permit review are not robust enough to resolve potential significant cumulative impacts even though it may be clear that the collective impact of many such proposals could adversely affect or imperil a wetland resource area a reasonable hedge against the cumulative impact is the ascription of a flanking undisturbed buffer of suitable width storm damage preventionflood control the town of barnstables 100 miles of coastline have long provided an active interface for the power of the sea and the buffering capacity of its coastal land forms marshes beaches dunes and banks 1 the concern for continued efficacy of the foregoing resource areas in buffering storing or containing floodwaters has recently been elevated in the face of predictions for sea level rise in the next century due to an increasingly warm atmosphere a rise in mean sea level of 20 cm to 40 cm has been predicted by the year 2100 oerlemans 1989 however other projections find mean sea level will increase by 66 cm in the same period steward 1989 however it is important to note that only the relative rate of increase in sea level is being debated not the tendency to sustained increase in the centuries ahead the effect of an accelerated rise in sea level will be an appreciable acceleration in coastal erosion processes and their notable manifestations land erosion storm damage flooding and loss of coastal wetlands 2 additionally impacts to coastal resource areas may be incurred as a result of site development rill erosion of coastal banks and sedimentation of salt marshes may result from lack of appropriate drainage conveyance systems or erosion control practices for surface flows in the face of the scientific concern over the acceleration of the rate of sea level rise and so that uplandinduced impacts to coastal resource areas may be minimized the imposition of a flanking undisturbed buffer zone of suitable width is found both advisable and necessary respectively 3 e how wide a buffer the massachusetts audubon society has recommended the imposition of threehundredfootwide natural undisturbed buffers in those areas that directly abut critical resource areas projects proposed for prohibition within the buffer zone include both nonwaterdependent activities building construction sewage disposal systems and waterdependent activities bulkheads revetments brady and buchsbaum 1989 minimum buffer zone widths as mandated by other northeast states for areas of critical environmental concern range from 200 feet in rhode island to up to 300 feet in maine maryland and new jersey f  7040 barnstable code  7040   7041 applicability pursuant to the regulation of activity under wetlands protection town of barnstable in the onehundredfoot buffer zone to resource areas note for purposes of this regulation land subject to coastal storm flowage shall not be treated as a resource area listed in 310 cmr 1002 1a and in  the following regulations shall apply conclusion the conservation commission finds that the uniform provision of an undisturbed buffer zone width of 50 feet will serve to insulate wetland resource areas from adverse impacts stemming from development elsewhere in the buffer zone in cases where the slope of an undisturbed buffer exceeds 18% or in any instance where the scope or nature of the project is likely to require a greater spatial offset to wetland resource areas the commission reserves the right to increase buffer zone width to a more suitable dimension g literature cited

barnstable as a seaward face or elevated landform other than a coastal dune which resides at the landward side of a coastal beach land subject to tidal action or other coastal wetland a coastal bank must have a slope greater than 18% compare figures 1 and 3150 a coastal bank may serve as a vertical buffer to floodwater or as a sediment source  7052 comparison of dep and town policy coastal bank policy loosely parallels deps bank policy 921 but important differences exist  7053 methods for determining slope in contrast with dep to be regulated a coastal bank must have a slope greater than 18% the toe of bank is that point where the slope first exceeds 18% the top of bank is that point where the slope diminishes to 18% or less figures 3 and 4 observe that the top of bank may occur below figure 4 or above figure 3 the fema onehundredyear coastal floodplain 1 a slope less than or equal to 18% is not a coastal bank under although it may be under dep policy figure 1 2 under dep policy a coastal bank may arise anywhere the fema onehundredyear coastal floodplain occurs as long as the slope criteria are met thus a dep coastal bank may occur at a seemingly interior location removed from the shoreline itself but where the topography is low and the landscape prone to coastal flooding under a regulatable coastal bank must necessarily reside adjacent to a tidal waterbody 3 a in common with dep multiple or tiered coastal banks may reside at the same site figure 5 1 a coastal bank may extend above the fema onehundredyear coastal floodplain only when the toe of bank is located below the floodplain figure 3 that is a bank originating beyond the fema onehundredyear coastal floodplain is presumed insignificant to storm damage prevention and flood control interests and is not regulated figure 2 2 b 150 editors note figures 1 and 3 are included at the end of this chapter  7047 coastal banks  7053  abutter notification general references wetlands protection  see ch 237  7061 request for determination of applicability rda notice of intent noi and amended order ao slopes of potential coastal banks shall be determined by employing one or more linear transects depending on the banks profile view where the slope is relatively uniform figure 3 the transect shall extend from the toe of bank to the fema onehundredyear coastal floodplain or velocity zone should no a zone be indicated the derived runup slope must exceed 18% to qualify as regulatable 1 where the slope is variable figure 5 the transects shall be fitted so that the steepest portions of the bank are analyzed employing a single transect that includes both steep and gently sloping portions of the bank would serve to average the runup slope and shall not be considered appropriate 2 a the top of coastal bank may be determined by either sighting the first observable break in the greater than 18% slope or by using the transect method to quantify the point at which the slope diminishes to 18% or less b observe that as this policy and methodology are independent of their dep counterparts different local and state banks may exist at the same site c slopes which are clearly less than 18% shall require no demonstration that they are not regulatable where slopes are clearly greater than 18% a regulated coastal bank may simply be conceded by the applicant without detailed analysis otherwise slopes for notice of intent filings shall typically be determined from field survey spot elevations transect locations shall be shown in plan view with spot elevations and runup slope indicated as a rule

resource values of storm damage prevention fin and shellfisheries wildlife habitat erosion and sediment control and recreation construction and use of shore outhauls can have adverse effects on resource areas and on the use of these areas for recreational purposes further shore outhauls destroyed by storms pose a threat to nearby properties by increasing waterborne debris c turbulence such as caused by jetdrive boats and propeller dredging generated by boat use with shore outhauls significantly increase turbidity levels high turbidity levels attenuate light light is necessary for the photosynthetic process responsible for the primary productivity and oxygen regeneration of the water the suspended sediments settle on shellfish beds smothering existing shellfish and altering the quality of the benthic environment essential for spat mollusk larvae settlement resuspension of bottom sediments causes redistribution of sediments alteration in sediment grain size distribution and causes changes in bottom topography relief elevation and grade induding creation of depressions in the bottom settlement of sediments into depressions can create deep pockets of highly fluidlike sediment which may not be able to physically support shellfish or which can become anoxic and therefore not support shellfish disturbance of sediments during the period of shellfish larval settlement hinders or prevents the effective settlement of shellfish larvae boat traffic generated from shore outhauls will add to this disruption and may cause erosion of banks and marshes d construction of shore outhauls and subsequent boat activity causes resuspension of nutrientladen sediment particles which may cause a release of sedimentbound nutrients to the water column resulting in a bloom of vegetation release of nutrients to the water column leads to eutrophication and anoxic bottom conditions anoxic sediments and anoxic bottom conditions create adverse impacts on benthic resources including shellfish and fisheries e propeller turbulence near or in areas of submerged aquatic vegetation such as eel grass or salt marsh damages vegetation thereby increasing the rate at which organic detritus is produced if this organic detritus does not completely decompose aerobically then anoxic bottom conditions will ensue which adversely impact shellfish and fisheries f cumulative
