projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety b purpose the purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction this article seeks to meet that purpose following objectives 1 minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding siltation river bank erosion  2 minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality  3 minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the predevelopment hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable  4 reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution wherever possible management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety c applicability this article shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan applications unless eligible for an exemption or a waiver in accordance with section 38194 the article also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules to prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff the city has developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new development sites these standards apply to any construction activity disturbing one acre or more of land the following activities may be exempt from these stormwater performance criteria 1 developments that do not disturb more than one acre of land provided they are not part of a larger common development plan 2 repairs to any stormwater management practice deemed necessary by the stormwater coordinatorinspector when a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a redevelopment project decisions on permitting and onsite stormwater requirements shall be governed by special stormwater sizing criteria found in the postconstruction stormwater manual this criteria is dependent on the amount of impervious area created by the redevelopment and its impact on water quality final authorization of all redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the planning and development director d compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements this article is not intended to interfere with abrogate or annul any other ordinance rule or regulation statute or other provision of law the requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements
