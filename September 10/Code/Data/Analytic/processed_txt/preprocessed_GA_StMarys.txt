to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the city of st marys georgia does ordain as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city of st marys georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  2 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  3 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion  4 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and 5 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  objectives the objectives of this chapter are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  3 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  4 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  5 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  6 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  and 7 to ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area  general provisions a lands to which this chapter applies this chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city of
