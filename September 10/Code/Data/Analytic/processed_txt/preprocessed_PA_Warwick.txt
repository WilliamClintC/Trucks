management and grading  statement of conditions the warwick township board of supervisors enacts this chapter upon direction of the pennsylvania department of environmental protection which has determined that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development and redevelopment throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and floodreduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitats and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens c a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater is an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project designs that maintain the natural hydraulic regime and sustain high water quality groundwater recharge stream base flow and aquatic ecosystems the costeffective and environmentally advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is project design that minimizes impervious surfaces and sprawl avoids sensitive areas ie stream buffers floodplains and steep slopes and considers topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime  1571 speedtiming devices  1572   1573 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health safety and welfare within the township by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime and by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in this chapter designed to e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential
