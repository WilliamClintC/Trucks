the economic policy institutes august 2000 issue guide higher wages lead to more efficient service provision payment of higher wages is associated with greater business investment in employee training higher productivity and lower employee turnover and this chapter is intended to promote better quality and reliability of services procured for the city or provided to city inhabitants by contractorvendors and grantees by promoting higher productivity and retention of employees working on city contracts and grants  2 this chapter is adopted pursuant to the citys spending and procurement powers as set forth in the city charter and provided under of the 1963 constitution and provides for payment of living wages only to employees of covered employers  further this chapter

accept city grants falling within this chapters coverage 3 the michigan league for human services found in its october 1998 report economic selfsufficiency a michigan benchmark that a family of 3 required at that time on average $272400 a month to pay for housing food child care health care transportation clothing household supplies a telephone and taxes and this was at the time equivalent to an hourly wage of $1583 for households with a single worker and $792 for households with 2 workers  4 the michigan county social services association found in its 2000 market basket survey that a minimal needs budget for a family of 3 in michigan required $1522200 per year not including anything for health care benefit costs and assuming rent of only $46500 a month according to the us department of housing and urban development the fair market rent for a 2bedroom apartment in ann arbor metropolitan statistical area for 2000 was $71700 a month and the fair market rent for a 3bedroom apartment was $94000 a month this means that a family of 3 requires at least $1824600 a year to meet a minimal needs budget in the ann arbor area not including health care this converts to an hourly wage of $877 for a fulltime fullyear employee  5 federal and state minimum wages currently set at only $515 an hour mean that a fulltime fullyear minimum wage employee earns only $20600 a week or $1071200 a year while the 2000 united states department of health and human services federal poverty guideline was $835000 for a single person $1125000 for a 2person family $14150 a year for a 3person family and $1705000 a year for a 4person family  and income near the poverty level is not a desirable standard of living sufficient to meet the subsistence needs of a family in ann arbor and its

designated as a new ch 32 to read as herein set out see the table for a detailed analysis of inclusion   findings and purpose 1 the city council finds that the further development of cable communications may result in great benefits for the people of the city cable technology is rapidly changing and cable plays an essential role as part of the citys basic infrastructure cable television systems permanently occupy and extensively make use of scarce and valuable public rightsofway in a manner different from the way in which the general public uses them the city council finds that public convenience safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers vested in the city to protect the public and to ensure that any franchise granted is operated in the public interest 2 further it is recognized that cable systems have the capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to the citys residents but can provide a variety of broadband interactive communications services to institutions and individuals many of these services involve city agencies and other public institutions 3 in light of the foregoing the following goals among others underlie the provisions set forth in this chapter a cable should be available to as many city residents as possible b a cable system should be capable of accommodating both present and reasonably foreseeable future cablerelated needs and interests of the city and its residents c a cable system should be constructed and maintained during a franchise term so that changes in technology may be integrated to the maximum extent possible into existing system facilities d a cable system should be responsive to the needs and interests of the local community and shall provide diverse programming e a cable operator should pay fair compensation to the city for the occupation and use of the local public rightsofway 4 the city council intends that all provisions set forth in this chapter be construed to serve the public interest and the foregoing public purposes and that any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter be construed to include the foregoing findings and public

that women of childbearing age and children under age 15 should not eat more than 1 meal per month of these fish  6 several states and cities around the world have demonstrated that removal of mercurycontaining products such as mercury thermometers from the waste stream is an effective way to reduce mercury contamination the u s environmental protection agency the american hospital association and the american public health association are currently implementing programs to eliminate mercury waste  7 mercury thermometers are not currently used or dispensed at either the

significant portion of this district coincides with the east william historic district and for this reason preservation of the integrity of these resources is a high priority as is the retention of the overall sense of scale while increased building mass can be accommodated in this district it is the intent to maintain the traditional scale and rhythm of residential buildings 4 east huron 1 the east huron 1 overlay district is located on the north side of east huron street including north fifth avenue and south state street on a major transportation corridor the address of many civic buildings institutions and wellknown landmarks of the downtown skyline most of its properties have freestanding buildings surrounded by open space or have front courtyards or plazas several of which are open to the public there is a significant contrast between the massing and scale of the structures within this character district and the residential scale of the structures within this character district and the residential scale of the adjacent historic neighborhoods which surround the district on the north east and west sides east huron 1 lies between the old fourth ward division street and ann street historic districts and a business loop this context is its defining feature and therefore calls for a higher degree of sensitivity in design and massing to strike a balance between the downtown core and adjacent historic residential neighborhoods 5 east huron 2 the east huron 2 overlay district is located on the south side of east huron street between south division and north state

district is for infill development that preserves historic buildings assets supports downtown activities and provides nonmotorized connections of a system of public and common open spaces new development along the allen creek floodplain should be sited to provide green space on site and be located in such a way that it will connect with green space on abutting properties c applicability

commissioner and the commissioners office are referred to as wcwrc purpose a the city council recognizes and is concerned that excessive quantities of soil are eroding from certain areas that are undergoing development for nonagricultural uses such as housing developments industrial areas recreational uses and roads this erosion makes necessary costly repairs to gullies washed out fills roads and embankments the resulting sediment clogs storm sewers and road ditches muddies watercourses and siltsin lakes and reservoirs and is considered a major water pollutant which degrades the natural environment within its jurisdiction and is costly to remedy b water quality and quantity within the water resources of the city is a public concern as the city is developed natural vegetation is removed and replaced with impervious surfaces as a result the hydrology of watercourses ponds and wetlands is changed these changes in quantity speed and timing of water runoff transform ann arbors watercourses as the volume and speed of water increases so does the erosive action of runoff on hillsides stream banks and bottoms as more soils are transported down waterways and as more damage occurs to stream banks and bottoms natural systems are destroyed or diminished throughout the watershed urban activity also contaminates the lands surface contaminants are carried with runoff into all aquatic habitats where they poison wildlife and contribute to the decline of aquatic resources for people the combination of these effects diminishes the quality of drinking water inhibits healthy fisheries reduces recreation and lessens scenic beauty the city recognizes the relationship between land use and water quality  and by doing so desires to control nonpoint source water pollution

guidelines and requirements for mitigating important natural features which cannot be excluded from development endangered species habitats endangered species are most likely to be found in the midst of natural areas described in this section as highest concern when a rare threatened or endangered species is found careful assessment should be made of the species and the area in which it is found these organisms and their habitat may be intolerant of change caused by a development such as change in hydrological conditions even if the habitat itself is outside the limits of soil disturbance for a project these species and their habitats are important to the city for the richness and diversity of species they offer a identification within ann arbor the areas most likely to contain endangered species are sandy wet bottom lands and wetlands along the huron river along its tributaries and in the many small pocket wetlands in native forest fragments many of these areas can be quite small in size rare and unusual endangered species of ferns bryophytes orchids grasses etc may also be found on disturbed ground including along shorelines and streambanks flooded areas old farmed fields borrow pits eroding slopes burned areas embankments along railroads and roads in cemeteries old settlement areas and farmsteads etc b protection priorities the protection of endangered species and their habitats are regulated by the state of michigan department of natural resources mdnr in cooperation with the us fish and wildlife service the city will work in coordination with state and federal

conditions are very important to protect from development they involve native floodplain development standards 523 natural features|  floodplains 100year effective date   forest fragments extremely rare or native sedge or fen meadows rare and important natural areas potentially habitats for rare species in the city these areas not only are rich biologically but provide floodplain function these floodplains of highest concern should be preserved as part of any development proposal which means not only is there no disturbance to soils but there is no disturbance to surface and subsurface hydrological regimes in cases where these habitats exist and are being invaded by exotics every reasonable effort should be taken to restore the habitat as part of a development proposal where enhancement of capacity and function can be done it should be 2 midlevel concern forested floodplains dominated by exotics including black alder several willows and floodplain meadows dominated by cattails or purple loosestrife are of midlevel concern even with the presence of exotics forested floodplains are vital to the continued functioncapacity of the floodplain whenever possible these areas should be left undisturbed restoration of these areas with native plants is usually useful in enhancing its function appearance and wildlife value floodplains of midlevel concern should not be built upon in any case the floodplains function and capacity should not be diminished where enhancement of capacity and function can be done it should be 3 lowlevel concern floodplains characterized by paving or turf or otherwise cleared land are of low level concern they can further be developed or redeveloped as necessary a key concern to guide such decisions should be whether there are flooding and water quality problems in the watershed and what opportunity exists for mitigation to address these problems proposed development or redevelopment c protection measures 1 soil erosion on any construction site in any floodplain should be minimized to the maximum extent practicable special effective soil erosion and flood protection techniques should be devised and required in each instance during construction and for as long afterward as it takes for vegetation to become very well established and for soils to be stable during stormflooding events these techniques and devices need careful design and maintenance to protect against washout in storm events and damage to water resources 2 barrier fencing shall be installed at the limits of soil disturbance including any floodplain barrier fencing shall be a minimum of four feet in height and shall remain in place in good condition until authorized to be removed no filling excavating or storage of materials debris or equipment shall take place within the fenced area development standards 523 natural features|  woodlands effective date   d mitigation floodplain areas shall be mitigated to provide no net loss of flood storage capacity and shall comply with any conditions of a valid permit from the michigan department of environment quality in accordance with the michigan natural resources and environmental protection act 1994 pa 451 as amended to date if mitigation is proposed offsite it shall be located in the same watershed as the development site disturbed areas to be reestablished shall be planted with species native to michigan and characteristic of the plant communities of the area before disturbance the density and coverage of vegetation except trees shall be such that it will approximate the density and coverage before disturbance within three years of planting e guidelines for best mitigation practices 1 where the actual volumeland area of a floodplain is affected by a proposed development the volumeland area of the floodplain lost should be restored elsewhere on the site or in the watershed 2 where paved surfaces are proposed in a floodplain they should be minimized to the fullest extent possible the area of paved surface on a site in a floodplain should be mitigated by new floodplain with native floodplain species installed elsewhere on the site or elsewhere in the watershed or it should be mitigated by a landscape design for the site that enhances floodplain function 3 where forest fragments fen and sedge meadows are removed or disturbed they should be mitigated to replicate equally valuable natural features on the site or in some other location in the watershed 4 lesser quality plant communities should also be replaced but the level of diversity of the mitigation may be less using native associations is more desirable 5 to the fullest extent possible regardless of existing conditions landscape design for a project proposed in a floodplain should avoid turf and use preferably native associations of plant materials that can become effective on the site as healthy floodplain plant communities 6 alternate mitigation when these procedures are not possible could include management of other natural features on the site or restoration work on floodplains elsewhere on the site or within the watershed they might include addition of storm water control facilities beyond other code requirements woodlands the citys woodlands are of two primary types either planted and volunteer or naturally regenerating native forest whether planted volunteer naturally regenerating native forest or a grove of old trees woodlands are important to the scenic and biological quality of life of the city development standards 523 natural features|  woodlands effective date   a identification 1 native forest fragments native forest fragments are visible on early low altitude aerial photographs of the city before the invasion of exotic woody plants these fragments are typified by their unfarmed soils and by the combination of plants constituting an ecosystem association recognizable as dating back to 1824 these fragments can be floodplain forests black and silver maples red ash hickories wooded mesic or wetland forests red oak and red maple dry forests on the tops of sand and gravel filled moraines and kames white oak hickories and white ash to mesic forests on moister upland soils sugar maple red maple and american beech a very wide variety of species existed as part of these associations and can be present in the regenerating fragments 2 urban woodlands urban woodlands are areas which have the density necessary to meet the definition of woodland used by the city but which are not native forest fragments groves of planted trees often of pines or spruces are found throughout the city volunteer trees may come into an area so densely as to create a woodland under the definition some people may plant and cultivate trees densely enough to qualify these landscapes do not function as selfsustaining ecosystems but they can function as valuable wildlife habitat can provide great scenic resource do influence the climate and make life in the city more enjoyable for people 3 pioneer woodlands pioneer woodlands are those which arise on disturbed soils such as soils which have gone period of cultivation in the european monocultural style or soils which have been overturned moved or graded to the extent that seed and the related beneficial soil microflora for regenerating the ecosystem is destroyed or greatly diminished pioneer woodlands are usually found on abandoned farm fields or waste sites of various sorts these woodlands are often dominated by invasive exotic shrubs and are impoverished wildlife sites in some cases native forest fragments are colonizing into fields once farmed adjacent to them these areas are rich wildlife habitats and should be treated with care along with the native forest fragments b protection priorities 1 highest concern native forest fragments particularly those that still have a wide diversity of native species at all levels woody and herbaceous plants are the most important sites to protect from development and from the impact of development many of these sites have been and are being rapidly invaded by exotic species of shrubs primarily and need active care as well as protection to sustain them the highest quality among these fragments should not be built upon these fragments should be retained as public land and development standards 523 natural features|  woodlands effective date   managed as natural areas effort should be made to preserve and protect all remaining native forest fragments to the fullest extent possible further fragmentation is not desirable 2 midlevel concern ann arbors urban woodlands are directly derived from peoples planting activities as the city developed woods and trees involved in these settings very likely have considerable importance to people who live near them 3 lowlevel concern generally speaking pioneer woodlands that are now developing in the city are often dominated by exotic trees and shrubs with an occasional large native tree that a farmer retained in his field new well designed and well planted built landscapes would be more appealing and more valuable in the long term than protecting these woodlands vegetation must be removed in order to return it to a more natural and pleasing landform landmark trees and other valuable features may exist on the site if so they would be key concerns in the design of development for these areas rare endangered species can also exist on disturbed sites c protection measures 1 native forest fragments excluded from development should be defended from all intrusions during development by wellmaintained barrier fencing 2 where native forest fragments are to be built in but not completely removed then those areas to be excluded from development should be clearly fenced during the process grading roads walkways utility lines and all other aspects of soil disturbance should be minimized to the fullest extent that sound design and public safety will allow 3 clearing for buildings should be strictly minimized to the least area needed to work around buildings excavated spoils from basements and other needed grading should not be spread on the site in the native forest fragment area very careful handling of trees near the building envelope should be undertaken to the fullest extent possible 4 where management of retained native forest fragments is undertaken these activities should be conducted according to the principles and techniques described in a welldeveloped management plan advice from qualified natural area managers should be sought and included in such plans a key element of these plans should be the control of invasive species which threaten natural areas throughout the city 5 the most effective way to save trees is by planning ahead for their protection four steps will help accomplish this a delineate areas with severe limitations and stay away from them provide barriers development standards 523 natural features|  woodlands effective date   b design the site to minimize gradingsoil disturbance in the vicinity of retained trees c provide for adequate and effective storm water management d design landscape installations to complement and honor retained trees 6 in addition to protective fencing at the critical root zone a number of other construction techniques can help save trees these include placing utilities under pavement instead of under trees  tunneling utilities under trees instead of trenching  using granular material when placing minimum amounts of fill over roots  excavating by hand  and keeping heavy equipment and vehicle traffic away from the critical root zone grading changes should not either increase or decrease moisture conditions in the critical root zone 7 any

practices 1 when native forest fragments must be taken in whole or in part they should be mitigated by the installation of replacement trees or by the creation of an area planted with a comparable plant association trees understory trees shrubs herbaceous plants  not including exotics on the site or elsewhere in the city 2 where a valuable native forest fragment must be partly destroyed by development the balance of the fragment should be actively managed as a natural area to sustain it into the future this includes the important task of controlling invasive exotics 3 urban woodlands may also have considerable value to city residents development in them should be handled as sensitively as possible tree replacements for trees taken from such a woodland should be replaced on the site in a manner that complements the character of woodland landscape design of the site should also complement the character of the woodland and should be sensitive to screening and otherwise providing affected neighbors with pleasant views into the site 4 care should be taken during the development process to conserve topsoils which must be disturbed on site and to install plant materials into optimum conditions compacted soils placed by heavy machines are not suitable for successful establishment of many types of plants retained topsoils can be used in new planting zones to great benefit 5 alternative mitigation plans which could be negotiated could include management or restoration of comparable natural features on the site or on public lands elsewhere in the city or donation of trees to the city to be planted on public land donation of time and materials to assist the city in managing valuable natural areas on public land valuable wetlands on the site or elsewhere could be enhanced storm water retention capacity could be increased and floodplain capacity and function could be improved  each beyond that already required by code landmark trees large old picturesque

concern the most important landmark trees to protect are ones which are rare unusual old or historically significant certain trees may play a special role in the visual resources of a site or an area if the trees are native to ann arbor known to have grown here in 1824 they are particularly important to protect 2 midlevel concern trees which are mature late succession species provide wildlife habitat or visual screening represent good diversity of species have interesting flowers or other features or are in proximity to a native forest fragment and are related to it 3 lowlevel concern pioneer species of woody plants arising on sites with highly disturbed soils trees and shrubs not native to the region and known to be invasive seeding prolifically and naturalizing into the neighborhood or into natural areas generally speaking a fine quality planted landscape can be more valuable in the long term and more appealing to more people in the short term than many pioneer woodlands in the city d protection measures 1 all tree roots are vulnerable to disturbance and some species are more so than others all construction activity including the effects on soil moisture and drainage of grading changes in the area should be excluded from the critical root zone of trees to be preserved according to submitted plans these activities should be avoided to prevent and minimize

project design replacement requirements include using species native to michigan and a diversity of species in a range of sizes where trees are taken from a natural area it is the natural area which should be replaced or restored at some other location involving much more than just tree planting trees which go into such a project may need to be smaller in size to find enough of the species needed to make a viable start to creating an ecosystem 2 replacement trees need a chance to become as great as the trees they replace genuine concern for soils and cultural needs of new plants should be a part of the design process many species of trees will never thrive in compacted fill soils or in conditions not suitable for their optimum growth recognition of these realities is critical to successful replacement 3 where it is not possible to install the number of trees required alternate mitigation plans may be developed  including active management or restoration of natural areas on the site planting of trees on public land elsewhere in the city additional storm water controls beyond that required and of help with flooding conditions on the site or in the watershed donation of public land on the site or elsewhere etc steep slopes steep slopes in ann arbor are found on the sides of moraines kames and ravines and the eroded valleys of waterways steep slopes are prone to erosion if the vegetation on them is disturbed or if surface runoff is directed toward them or down them as a result disturbed slopes often result in deposition of soils in watercourses and on the land below hydrologic functions such as infiltration frequency and volume of discharges and impacts of the proposed development upon water resources on and off site must be considered the citys steep slopes still often retain on them or adjacent to them various wetlands prairiesavannas rare species floodplains watercourses and the citys largest areas of native forest fragments steep slopes with native forest fragments or other overlapping natural features have high natural and scenic value scenic values are measurable each site can be quantified for its relative overall scenic value as viewed from vista points off the site steep slopes especially those in the huron river valley still covered by native forest fragments are the most important natural scenic assets of the city vistas of unbroken native forest tree canopy visible on steep slopes and moraine tops are vital to maintain across the city a identification 1 steep slopes are naturally occurring landforms with a vertical

contour lines they were identified on the map of steep slopes of ann arbor 2004 most steep slopes in the city occur in the huron river corridor or along its tributaries 2 also shown on the map are zones 3000 feet each way from the centerline of the huron river and zones 500 feet each way from the centerlines of the tributary streams in the city these zones encompass the great majority of steep

lowlevel concern a steep slopes not within 3000 feet of the huron river or within 500 feet of its open or historic tributaries are of lowlevel concern b development on steep slopes requires special techniques to prevent soil erosion and to protect water resources a study of ground and surface water flows of the site may be required to understand possible on and offsite impacts of a proposed development on the water resources landscape work on these sites should be designed to restore native ecologies to reduce storm water runoff to enhance infiltration to increase flood storage capacity to allow only clean water to exit the site and to honor natural linkages and natural areas and adjacent water features soils must not be permitted to wash from these sites under any circumstances c the sites design should incorporate the slopes so that the development complements the character of the landforms vegetation and topography any development must meet all the standards for any other natural features of the site c protection measures 1 barrier fencing shall be installed at the limits of soil disturbance adjacent to steep slopes barrier fencing shall be a minimum of four feet in height and shall remain in place in good condition until it is authorized to be removed no filling excavating or storage of materials debris or equipment shall take place within the fenced area 2 protection measures must be in place before landform or vegetation disturbance to prevent any offsite damage any damage to waterways or offsite locations from erosion must be promptly repaired to the fullest extent practical using best management techniques a heavy rain event is not an excuse for such damage to occur collateral damage during and after construction to canopy trees on scenically important sites must be scrupulously avoided it will take 150 years to replace any unintended losses plans presented for development on steep slopes must reflect sound analysis of scenic values must show very serious concern for soil erosion controls and have very carefully crafted limits of disturbance lines and must indicate procedures whereby all contractors subcontractors owners and inspectors are fully and continuously informed of the values on the site that must be protected without errors 3 great attention should be exercised in the approval and inspection process regarding

along them drainage should be directed to inlet structures and not be permitted to flow down slopes during and after construction 4 the primary goal in protecting steep slopes is to prevent erosion and subsequent damage to natural features on and off the site underground utilities should not be located in steep slopes and should not run lengthwise along them drainage should be directed to inlet structures and not be permitted to flow down slopes during and after construction 5 protection measures for other natural features placed at risk by intrusion onto a steep slope should be designed and implemented in such a way that risk of damage to the natural features involved is the minimum possible these provisions may need to be significantly more strenuous than those which might be implemented for the same natural features on flat ground d mitigation disturbed areas of steep slopes shall approximate the natural terrain and be planted with native vegetation at the completion of construction no new drainage may be directed over areas of disturbed slope disturbed areas to be reestablished shall be planted with species native to michigan and characteristic of the plant communities of the area before disturbance the density and coverage of vegetation except trees shall be such that it will approximate the density and coverage before disturbance within three years of planting e guidelines for best mitigation practices 1 if any portion of a high or midlevel concern steep slope must be disturbed as part of an approved project then the balance of the steep slope area must be protected from disturbance during construction and it must be managedrestored as a natural area thereafter this means considerable attention will be paid to herbaceous understory and canopy flora the built landscape around any approved buildings shall use minimum impervious surface and shall be very complementary to the adjoining natural area roof water on the site and other surface rainwater drainage systems on the site are to be designed to infiltrate to groundwater where possible in such a way as to approximate infiltration on the site prior to the project runoff from roads may need cleaning first the use of green roofs are encouraged to reduce runoff the design of the building and its location on the site should not diminish the views of or character of the views of the site ie removal of a closed native forest canopy 2 change to any natural features on a steep slope site must meet the mitigation standards for those natural features replacement development standards 523 natural features|  watercourses effective date   materials techniques and longterm maintenance routines required as mitigation should serve to restore the visual character of the site 3 followup monitoring may be required in some instances for a period of time related to the duration of the restoration work or recovery from damage watercourses the preeminent natural feature in the city is the huron river its tributaries and the glacial landforms and topography which embrace them these watercourses bring water to and property and together create vital wildlife corridors city they are key components of scenic beauty and of outdoor attraction for people in the city and on many individual properties they also serve the practical function of providing drinking water either directly the citys main water supply intakes are in barton pond or indirectly by the primary conduits of ground water recharge the huron river is the main watercourse city other watercourses in the city are tributaries and subtributaries of the huron river many parts of streams and some entire streams no longer exist above ground they have been placed underground in storm pipes eg allen creek most of the remaining tributaries are in poor condition because they have been overwhelmed by the increased runoff generated by development of the city construction of structures in watercourses and bottomlands of lakes and ponds is regulated by state statute under permits issued by the department of environmental quality the purpose of state requirements are to minimize dredging and filling in watercourses and in bottom lands to minimize negative impacts which result from necessary activities of this sort and in the case of wetlands which are associated with these projects replace the lost resources a identification many streams and bodies of water qualifying as watercourses and bottomlands will be visible on aerial photographs and maps many small ponds and the uppermost reaches of some streams may not these features are readily identifiable in the field watercourses are clearly delineated on floodplain maps in the upper reaches of watersheds too small for those maps to have been done watercourses can and should be identified as the top of the bank of the channel carrying water or as the ordinary high water mark line of a pond streams in the city may cross relatively steep terrain and are likely to be combined with other valuable natural features including valuable woodlands wetlands and floodplains b protection priorities it is in the citys best interest to protect watercourses in as natural a condition as possible and to control storm water in watersheds in such a way that watercourses are not damaged and eroded during storm events while storm water is also regulated by this chapter the design of many elements on each site directly determines the way water is handled and what impacts it will have both on and off the site development standards 523 natural features|  watercourses effective date   1 highest concern watercourses with natural areas around them wetlands or native forest fragments watercourses integrated into steep terrain and watercourses still flowing in natural channels should be preserved as part of any development proposal crossing locations should be kept to the minimum necessary to provide access wide buffers should be provided to maintain a corridor for wildlife along stream ways where streams in these conditions exist on a site they are likely the most important design element of the site the design should capitalize on the value of these features and sustain them 2 midlevel concern urbanized aboveground watercourses are ones that no longer have much of a natural character but have not been placed into a storm drain beneath the ground whenever possible development should restore these watercourses and associated natural features and take advantage of them as a design amenity effort to control erosion sedimentation and contamination problems is strongly encouraged as is the connection of natural corridors across properties 3 lowlevel concern where watercourses are already underground floodplain capacity and function are the main concern restoration of the surface watercourse is encouraged particularly if the effort can assist in storm water control c protection measures 1 a natural feature buffer area within a line measured 25 feet horizontally from the ordinary high water mark of a watercourse shall be provided adjacent to a watercourse and maintained in relation to the entire watercourse as a natural feature unless and to the extent it is determined to be in the public interest not to maintain such area under the standards provided in  prohibited and permitted activities

guidelines for best mitigation practices watercourses should be crossed at the location where there is the least physical scenic and biological impact upon the watercourse and its surrounding natural features if surrounding natural features must be disturbed to facilitate the crossing they should be mitigated as prescribed in this section and by other code requirements wetlands a purpose 1 preservation and enhancement of wetlands is essential to maintaining and improving the citys aesthetic character its ecological stability its economic wellbeing its educational opportunities and its quality of life 2 wetlands are protected to help reduce damage to aquatic resources from erosion turbidity siltation and contamination they are protected to minimize the loss of native plants and animals to help preserve biological diversity and to minimize the loss of wildlife habitat within the city and to sustain many benefits wetlands can help provide  including flood control stormwater storage and release ground water recharge and water quality improvement b identification wetlands may be visible in low altitude aerial photos particularly older ones prior to the invasion by exotic shrubs and trees a map of potential wetland areas is on file in the city planning department the boundaries of wetlands shall be determined by considering vegetation and soils in the field 1 the

shall be made using the same criteria as provided for of the natural resources and environmental protection act 1994 pa 451 and administrative rules as amended 3 to facilitate verification the boundary of the wetland shall be flagged in the field by the applicant prior to the application for a wetland use permit c protection priorities 1 highest concern large wetland complexes forested wetlands and wetlands along watercourses with native plant associations still intact or regenerating these habitats should be carefully protected from development and from effects of development no change in hydrology in general wetlands with important native ecosystems cannot tolerate use as retention basins for storm water runoff from developed areas a separate filter and retention system should be developed so that impacts upon the wetland are minimal development standards 523 natural features|  wetlands effective date   2 midlevel concern disturbed wetlands with underlying hydric soils such as on once farmed lands constitute genuine opportunity to restore some of the capacity and function and diversity of species removed from the city over the last 100 years maintaining and enhancing the biological and hydrological value and function of these wetlands should be the primary concern use of these wetlands as retention basins may be acceptable as long as there are separate filtration basins and as long as the volumes of water involved do not overwhelm the plant life which must be sustained in the wetland 3 lowlevel concern low quality wetlands are those that have been greatly damaged have been reduced to open water andor a few species of plants or are dominated by invasive species replacement or relocation of these wetlands is more acceptable if they must be taken for development in many cases these wetlands can be effectively repaired and used for storm water retention and filtration d protection measures 1 a natural feature buffer area within a line measured 25 feet horizontally from the boundary or edge of a wetland identified as provided above shall be required unless and of the extent it is determined to be in the public interest not to maintain such area under the standards provided in  prohibited and permitted activities for the natural feature buffer area shall be the same as the prohibited and permitted activities regulated or allowed in or on the wetland unless prohibited activity is determined to be in the public interest and authorization has been granted by the planning commission under the standards provided in  where wetlands are to be used as a part of a storm water retention system the rules of the washtenaw county water resources commissioner should be followed to minimize negative impacts on the wetland e protection of

other activity on the property for which the use permit has been issued conditions may be established by the city to ensure that the intent of this chapter is carried out the activity or use shall be conducted in such manner as to cause the least amount of disruption of the protected wetland including but not limited to the following requirements 1 prior to any development clearing filling or other activity for which a wetland use permit is required protective construction fencing intended to restrict access shall be erected between the protected area and the area subject to development

development if the conditions are designed to remove an impairment to the wetland benefits to mitigate the impact of a discharge of fill material or otherwise improve the water quality 2 the city shall consider a mitigation plan if submitted by the applicant and may incorporate the mitigation actions as permit conditions for the improvement of the existing wetland resources or the creation of a new wetland resource to offset wetland resource losses resulting from the proposed project financial assurances may be required to ensure that mitigation is accomplished as specified by the permit conditions the city shall when requested by the applicant meet with the applicant to review the applicants mitigation plan 3 in developing conditions to mitigate impacts the city shall consider

determines that it is practical to replace the wetland resource values which will be unavoidably impacted the city shall consider all of the following criteria when reviewing an applicants mitigation proposal a mitigation shall be provided onsite where practical and beneficial to the wetland resources b when subdivision a of this subsection does not apply mitigation shall be provided in the immediate vicinity of the permitted activity where practical to the wetland resources provided that mitigation shall be within the same subwatershed of the huron river within which the proposed wetland use is located ie the allen creek fleming creek honey creek malletts creek miller creek swift run drain or traver creek subwatersheds if the proposed wetland use is not within one of the foregoing subwatersheds then mitigation may be within the huron river direct discharge area provided that mitigation in the huron river direct discharge area shall be within the city limits or within one mile upstream of the city limits mitigation upstream of the proposed wetland use is preferred c only when it has been determined by the public services area administrator that subdivisions a and b of this subsection are inappropriate and impractical shall mitigation be considered elsewhere d any proposal shall assure that upon completion there will be no net loss to the wetland resources any
