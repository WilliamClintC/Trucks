smith     clerk    contents preliminary unit  comparative tables of special ordinances   codified ordinances of lordstown   part one  administrative three  traffic five general offenses seven  business regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen building fifteen fire prevention  editors note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the beat accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting ordinance which enacts the codified ordinances  the comparative is included to show the diaposition of every ordinance included in the codified ordinances it indicatea whether a given ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more sections cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter   comparative editors note source material for the codified ordinances of lordstown was either ordinances or resolutions enacted by council or new matter ordained by the adopting ordinance the codified ordinances without any history indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the adopting ordinance in the following

offense  bwhen the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense the fact that one subsection of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability c1when language defining an element of an offense that is related to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to

probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact ca person acts recklessly when with heedless indifference to the consequences the

negligent with respect to circumstances when because of a substantial lapse from due care the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such circumstances may exist ewhen the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices to establish an element thereof then recklessness knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element when recklessness suffices to establish

health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base additionally structures that are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss in order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth these regulations are adopted cstatement of purpose it is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4minimize prolonged business interruptions  5minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges
