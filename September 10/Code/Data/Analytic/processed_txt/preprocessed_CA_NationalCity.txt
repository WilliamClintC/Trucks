interest beginning with supplement no 24 municipal will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation during original codification the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of book publishing company under the direction of donald mclean jr city attorney the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 24 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a subjectmatter index with complete crossreferencing locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers

title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of

the city has created an urgency for the planning acquisition improvement and operation of public parks playgrounds and recreational facilities to serve the increasing population of the city and an urgency for additional revenues with which to finance such public facilities thus it is the intent of the city council that each builder of each dwelling unit to be constructed within the city shall prior to construction pay a fee as described in this chapter the payment of such fee is required and assessed pursuant to the taxing power of the city and is solely for the purpose of producing revenue further it is the intent of the council that all revenue generated by the payment of such fee shall be used for the acquisition improvement development and operation of park or recreational

this chapter shall be known as the transportation development impact fee tdif ordinance and may be cited as such  part 2008   authority this chapter is enacted pursuant to the mitigation fee act california government et seq  part 2008   intent and purpose the purpose of this chapter is to make provision for assessing and collecting fees as a condition of approval of a subdivision map or prior to issuance of a development permit including a building permit to defray the actual or estimated costs of constructing planned transportation facilities necessary to accommodate increased traffic generated by future development consistent with et seq of the california government mitigation fee act application of this fee will include but is not limited to development for residential commercial and industrial land uses this tdif does not replace normal subdivision map exactions or other measures required to mitigate site specific impacts of a development project including but not limited to

district proceedings benefit assessments or taxes the fees collected pursuant to this chapter are to fund identified transportation facilities or portions thereof that will provide increased road capacity necessitated by the cumulative impacts of future development the transportation facilities for which these fees are collected are identified as tdif facilities in the adopted transportation impact fee program report further studies including environmental review may show superior alternative facilities that also provide the needed increased capacity once such studies are completed fees collected under this division may be used to fund those superior alternative facilities  part 2008   findings the city council of the city of national city consistent with california government et seq of the mitigation fee act finds that a the further development of property within the city as detailed in the transportation impact fee program report will require the construction of additional transportation facilities in addition san diego association of governments sandag policy as expressed transnet extension ordinance and expenditure plan is that new development shall contribute towards the regional arterial system regional transportation congestion improvement program rtcip the rtcip has an impact fee component to achieve its goals included in the regional arterial system are certain roadways in the city of national city which are also part of the citys transportation impact fee program the tdif advances a legitimate public interest by enabling both sandag and the city of national city to fund improvements to transportation infrastructure required to accommodate new development b the fees established herein are based upon estimated costs of identified transportation facilities or portions thereof the costs of which have been based on relative vehicular volumes attributable to future development the tdif will fund expanded facilities identified in the transportation impact fee program report and would also include those facilities identified in the rtcip located within the city of national city all to serve new development costs for planned transportation facilities are identified in the transportation impact fee program report costs funded by the tdif may include project administration and management design and engineering rightofway acquisition and construction more detailed descriptions of planned facilities including their location to the extent known are shown in the transportation impact fee program report and other documents such as the citys general plan the list of planned improvements contained in the transportation impact fee program report may change to meet changing circumstances and needs as the city of national city deems necessary the tdif will not be used to correct existing deficiencies in the roadway system c there is a reasonable relationship between construction of identified transportation facilities or portions thereof and the additional vehicular trips attributable to future development the city of national city will restrict tdif revenues to capital projects identified on the transportation impact fee program report to serve new development in that report certain improvements are also part of the regional arterial system identified in the sandag rtcip improvements funded by the tdif will expand certain arterials within the city of national city making them accessible to the additional residents and workers associated with new development the projects identified in the transportation impact fee program report will expand the capacity of the portions of the regional arterial system located within the city of national city to accommodate the increased trips generated by new development thus there is a reasonable relationship between the use of fee revenues and the residential and nonresidential types of new development that will pay the tdif d there is a reasonable relationship between the need for identified transportation facilities or portions thereof and the future development new dwelling units and building square footage are indicators of the demand for transportation improvements needed to accommodate growth as additional dwelling units and building square footage are created the occupants of these structures generate additional vehicle trips and place additional burdens on the transportation system the need for the tdif is based on the sandag transportation model projections of growth that show an increase in vehicle hours of delay on the regional arterial system primarily as a result of new development even with planned improvements to that system the model estimated impacts from new development based on trip generation rates that varied by land use category providing a reasonable relationship between the type of development and the need for improvements e there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee and the cost of transportation facilities or portions thereof attributable to future development this reasonable relationship between the tdif for a specific development project and the cost of the facilities attributable to that project is based on the estimated vehicle trips the project will add to the regional arterial system the total fee for a specific residential development is based on the number and type of new dwelling units multiplied by the trip generation rate for the applicable residential land use category the fee for a specific nonresidential development is based in a similar manner on the amount of building square footage by land use category larger projects generate more vehicle trips and pay a higher fee than smaller projects of the same land use category thus the fee ensures a reasonable relationship between the tdif for a specific development project and the cost of the improvements attributable to the project f the imposition of tdif on all new development associated with the generation of new traffic within the city of national city is necessary in order to protect the public health safety and welfare and in order to assure effective implementation of national citys

partially destroyed for an unreasonable period of time or which have been damaged by fire or decay or otherwise and cannot be repaired so as to conform to the requirements of title 15 of this code

depreciates property values d the existence of vacant buildings which become unsightly because of deteriorated weathered chipped cracked or peeled paint creates an economic disincentive to the value of surrounding property paint that is loose or falling to the ground causes a potential health and safety violation due to possible leadbased paint that could be ingested by children causing sickness mental retardation and possibly death e unless corrective measures are undertaken to cure and prevent such public nuisances such serious threats to the public health safety and welfare will continue

health concern in california the san diego air basin is currently designated as nonattainment for the state and federal ozone standard and the states particulate matter standards air pollution can cause or aggravate illnesses such as acute respiratory infections asthma chronic bronchitis emphysema and lung cancer in addition to health impacts air pollution imposes significant economic costs and negative impacts on our quality of life nuisance b the purpose of this chapter is to reduce public exposure to diesel particulate matter and other air contaminates by limiting the idling and practice of parking maneuvers of diesel fueled commercial vehicles the purpose of this chapter is also to reduce such exposure especially to schoolage children c the air resources board identified diesel exhaust particulate matter as a toxic air contaminant particulate matter pm10 can collect in lungs where it can increase the number and severity of asthma attacks cause aggravated bronchitis and cause other lung diseases particulate matter can also exacerbate other illnesses ozone is a strong irritant which can restrict airways resulting in difficulty breathing and forcing respiratory and cardiovascular systems to work harder chronic exposure reduces lung capacity lower stamina and leaves people vulnerable to longterm respiratory problems ozone is especially harmful to children senior citizens and those suffering from asthma or existing heart and lung disease d public agencies can play an important role in improving air quality by limiting the amount of time engines are allowed to idle within their jurisdiction public agencies have the responsibility to lead the effort to improve air quality by adopting ordinances that are costeffective in reducing ozone precursor emissions and toxic air contaminants e a study of idling exhaust emissions conducted by the us environmental protection agency epa420r02025 october 2002 indicates that a typical 1980s2001 model year truck operating on diesel fuel emits one hundred fortyfour grams per hour of nitrogen oxide and eight thousand two hundred twentyfour grams per hour of carbon dioxide emissions and consumes about 082 gallons of diesel fuel per hour while idling f a limitation on engine idling is established by the city of national city to discourage the idling of engines in the city g the practice of commercial vehicles practicing repeated parking maneuvers near schools and residences contributes to the emission of toxic air contaminates in a manner similar to idling a limitation on practicing parking maneuvers near schools and residences is established to discourage the emissions of toxic air contaminates  part 2007   definitions the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or
