resolution stating the city has acted in good faith to keep any and all building structures out of zone a according to the airport master plan whereas gary mcrell 33007 820th avenue olivia minnesota has a 5 acre building site in the east half of the east half of the ne quarter troy township 115 the city of olivia was notified mr mcrell has made application to renville county planning and zoning to construct a miscellaneous storage shed on said parcel of property where a single family residential dwelling was constructed in spring of 1999 legal description attached whereas the city of olivia acknowledges renville county has building permit authority for this application but would like to express concerns relating to the proposed location of the building in proximity to the olivia regional airport it is noted the minnesota aviation guidelines have established that gary mcrells property lies both in zone a and zone b the airport master plan identifies restrictions on lands located in the designated safety zones the purpose of these zones are to protect the safety and well being of the airport aircraft and adjacent land owners whereas according to aviation restrictions no buildings shall be permitted or allowed@ to be placed in zone a however  buildings may be allowed and constructed in zone b with elevation restrictions according to mndot office of aeronautics the city of olivia risks future state and federal airport funding if any type of building structure is found to be located in zone a currently the city of olivia receives 60% state grant funds for airport improvement projects whereas after careful consideration by short elliot & hendrickson city engineers it appears the proposed buildingshed would penetrate zone a based on current information available it was the recommendation of seh that the propose building location be moved an additional 20 to the east in zone b whereas at the regular meeting of the olivia city council on  the council moved to recommend renville county planning & zoning grant a building permit to gary mcrell based on our city engineers recommendation to move the building 20 straight to the east in zone b  providing renville county verify the final location of the building which would bring the new structure in compliance with the citys airport layout plan therefore be it resolved that based on the new revised site plan submitted by gary mcrell dated  the city of olivia recommends that renville county approve the permit because based on the site plan the building is clearly to be constructedlocated in zone b which allows for structures zoning therefore be it further resolved that said resolution no 200074 shall be recorded with the gary mcrell property and the olivia airport layout plan said resolution no
