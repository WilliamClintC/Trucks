from a plumbing fixture or other customer sources into a public water supply system main due to a temporary low or subatmospheric pressure within the public water supply system see fig 1c  22925 batavia code  22925  example a hose is submerged in a laboratory sink a both buildings are connected to the same public water supply system c this main could develop a low pressure due to a main break elsewhere in the system the building on the right has installed a booster pump in the system the building on the right has installed a booster pump in the basement at 8 in order to augment available pressures the booster pump could deplete the water in main c thereby subjecting the customers water system to a pressure less than atmospheric thus causing a reversal of flow from the laboratory in the opposite building certified backflow prevention device tester  a person who is nys department of health certified and found competent for the testing of backflow prevention devices he or she shall

the premises charged with the responsibility of complete knowledge and understanding of the water supply piping within the premises and for maintaining the consumers water system free from cross connections and other sanitary defects as required by regulations and laws a whenever possible crossconnection control will be achieved by the containment method any user employing a device which will achieve control by any other method will make written application to the watersewer foreman to request such authorization the watersewer foreman and the genesee county department of health will be the final authority determining the applicability of any and all devices so used b the containment method 1 using the containment approach to crossconnection control results in totally isolating a facility with a potential hazard from the public water supply system each water service line to such a facility will be protected in a manner commensurate with the degree of hazard when any portion of a consumers water supply system is rated hazardous then the entire system receives the same rated degree of hazard that includes piping for potable as well as nonpotable water  22925 water  22926   22927 determining degree of hazard and protection  22928 type of protection the protective device required shall depend on the degree of hazard as tabulated below 2 under certain conditions fire sprinkler system connections to the public water supply system may warrant a separate evaluation of the type of protective device required a degree of hazard to achieve containment an acceptable backflow prevention device must be installed in every service connection where deemed necessary under this article by the watersewer foreman or his designee 1 criteria to be used for determining the degree of hazard are as follows a use toxicity and availability of containments b availability of a supplementary supply of water c firefighting system evaluation 2 based on these considerations a facility will be rated as hazardous aesthetically objectionable or nonhazardous 3 this crossconnection control program will enact a major emphasis on isolating those facilities that pose the greatest hazard in the most vulnerable portions of the distribution system b degree of protection 1 the degree of protection shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard a a hazardous facility must be contained use of a rpz or an air gap b an aesthetically objectionable facility must be contained use of dcv c nonhazardous facilities may be but are not mandated by these regulations to be protected plumbing control to ensure that plumbing crossconnections are adequately protected or eliminated 2 it is not possible to list every circumstance and facility type that may be encountered while evaluating all water users in the water system therefore while evaluating a facility the inspector will rely on these regulations good common sense and the genesee county health department engineer as needed to adequately ensure the basic protection desired by this program 3 internal plumbing control necessary for the protection of the onpremises user is not equivalent to containment but is a necessary adjunct to a totally protective program the water customer is responsible to prevent crossconnection within his facility  22926 batavia code  22928   22929 firefighting system evaluation a any premises on which there is an auxiliary water supply the public water supply system shall be protected by an air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device b at the service connection to any premises on which a substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health if introduced into the public water supply is handled so as to constitute a crossconnection the public water supply shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly c at the service connection to any premises on which a substance of unusual toxic concentration or danger to health is or may be handled but not under pressure the public water supply shall be protected by an air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device this device shall be located at or as near the point of entry into the facility as possible immediately downstream of the water meter and all piping between the water meter and receiving tanks shall be entirely visible d at the service connection to any premises on which any material dangerous to health or toxic substance in toxic concentration is or may be handled under pressure the public water supply shall be protected by an air gap separation the air gap shall be located as close as practicable to the property line and receiving tanks shall be entirely visible if these conditions cannot reasonably be met the public water supply shall be protected with an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device providing this alternative is acceptable to the water sewer foreman and genesee county department of health e at the service connection to any sewage treatment plant or sewage pumping station the public water supply shall be protected by an air gap separation the air gap shall be located as close as practicable to the property line and all piping between the water meter and receiving tanks shall be entirely visible if these conditions cannot be reasonably met the public water supply shall be protected with an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device f at the service connection to any premises not covered by subsections a above the public water supply shall be protected with an approved single check valve assembly at the discretion of the watersewer foreman or his designee a a separate evaluation of the firefighting system in use at a facility is required because of the number of variables involved in making the determination of adequate protection of the public water supply system the sprinkler system service connection is usually an independent connection to the public water supply and as such will be separately evaluated as to the hazard posed fire department connections are used to pump water into sprinkler system the quality of water pumped into the sprinkler system may be of concern b the following outlines the type of acceptable backflow prevention device required by class of sprinkler system used awwa manual no m14 backflow prevention and crossconnection control the device is the minimum needed to satisfy containment requirements and applies only to sprinkler systems connected  22928 water  22929  to public water supply water mains 1 class 1 direct connections from public water mains only  no pumps tanks or reservoirs  no physical connection from other water supplies  no antifreeze or other additives of any kind  all sprinkler drains discharging to atmosphere dry wells or other safe outlets 2 class 2 same as class 1 except that booster pumps may be installed in the connections from the street mains booster pumps do not affect the potability of the system it is necessary however to avoid drafting so much water that pressure in the water main is reduced below 20 psi 3 class 3 direct connection from public water supply main plus one or more of the following elevated storage tanks  fire pumps taking suction from aboveground covered reservoirs or tanks  and pressure tanks all storage facilities are filled with or connected to public water only the water in the tanks to be maintained in a potable condition otherwise class 3 systems are the same as class 5 4 class 4 directly supplied from public mains similar to classes 1 and 2 and with an auxiliary water supply on or available to the premises  or an auxiliary supply may be located within 1700 feet of the pumper connection 5 class 5 directly supplied from public mains and interconnected with auxiliary supplies such as pumps taking suction from reservoirs exposed to contamination or rivers and ponds  driven wells mills or other industrial water systems  or where antifreeze or other additives are used 6 class 6 combined industrial and fire protection systems supplied from the public water mains only with or without gravity storage or pump suction tanks c corresponding backflow protection recommended  awwa m14 1 class 1 none other than the check valve required by the national fire 2 class 2 none other than the check valve required by the national fire 3 class 3 will generally require minimum protection approved dcv to prevent stagnant waters from backflowing into the public potable water system 4 class 4 will normally require backflow protection at the service connection the type air gap rpz or dcv will generally depend on the quality of the auxiliary supply  will normally need maximum protection air gap or rpz to protect the public potable water system 5 class 5 will normally need maximum protection air or rpz to protect the public potable water system 6 class 6 protection would depend on the requirements of both industry and fire protection and could only be determined by a survey of the premises  22929 batavia code  22930   22930 penalties for offenses  22931 acceptable devices a notification of violation the watersewer foreman shall notify the owner or authorized agent of the owner of any building or premises in which there is found a violation of this article of such violation the watersewer foreman shall set a reasonable time for the owner to have the violation removed or corrected upon failure of the owner to have the defect corrected by the end of the specified time interval the watersewer foreman may if in his judgment an imminent health hazard exists cause the water service to the building or premises to be terminated andor recommend such additional fees or penalties to be invoked as herein may be provided b fines the owner or authorized agent of the owner responsible for the maintenance of the plumbing systems in the building who knowingly permits a violation to remain uncorrected after the expiration of time set by the watersewer foreman shall upon conviction thereof by the court be required to pay a fine of not more than $100 for each violation each day of failure to comply with the requirements of this article after the specified time provided under shall constitute a separate violation a determination of acceptability only three devices are applicable to the containment concept of crossconnection control these are the dvc the rpz and the air gap b which dcv or rpz are acceptable acceptance of a device is based on one of the following two evaluation procedures 1 a device will be placed on the new york state department of health list of acceptable devices when it has successfully passed both the laboratory and the field evaluation phases of the foundation for cross connection control and hydraulic research approval program and the manufacturer has been granted a certificate of approval 2 a device which has been evaluated against each of the following three standards by an independent testing laboratory and shown to comply will be placed on the new york state department of health list of acceptable devices a foundation for crossconnection control and hydraulic research manual of crossconnection control specifications of backflow prevention devices b american society of sanitary
