of the rewriting of this zone in july of 200 there were only 2 owners of this entire land area with griffin land resources owning all but approximately 32 acres the undeveloped nature of the property and the small number of owners provide the town with a unique opportunity to guide the development of this area to assure that it is compatible with the towns plan of conservation and development the ed zone has several important attributes it is strategically located geographically with direct access to route 10202 and easy access to route 189 the ed zone can be serviced by public water and public sewer and is linked to major electrical and communication services the area that comprises the ed zone has been set aside for nonresidential development since zoning was first established in granby in the 1950s this is the primary and only significant area remaining within the town with potential for the diversification of the towns tax employment and commercial service base it is the desire of the town of granby to have this area developed in a manner which accomplishes this diversification while preserving the towns fundamental values and rural atmosphere as outlined within the plan of conservation and development understanding the attributes of the ed zone as outlined above the town has an opportunity to encourage development within this area in a manner that can be a model of quality and success the development of the ed zone can demonstrate that preservation and growth are not mutually exclusive and that diversification of the towns tax employment and commercial service base while preserving the towns fundamental values and rural atmosphere can be achieved a variety of special regulations have been adopted to regulate development within this ed zone these

shall give serious consideration to the establishment of streetscape buffers as outlined within the regulations and in accordance with the criteria established therein as a large portion of the streetscape within this area is void of significant vegetation in determining the depth of the streetscape buffer the commission shall give added weight to the quantity and quality of any new vegetation proposed along the frontage of the of the site 3 open space as stated in the general purposes of this zone the area contains ample amounts of land providing an opportunity to create significant areas of open space within the ed zone undeveloped areas shall be set aside to create a park like setting in order to accomplish such a setting an effort shall be made and the commission may require open space areas that are comprehensively linked throughout the ed zone such areas of open space shall be designed to complement building placement and to enhance the working environment of the employees and others who frequent the commercial facilities by serving as recreational corridors public spaces and natural areas in lieu of the requirements of b all developments shall have a primary and contiguous open space area equal to the footprint of the proposed building or buildings this open space area shall be located to balance the developed areas serving the above stated purpose where a development fronts salmon brook street and or floydville road the open space requirement may be satisfied creation of the streetscape bufferopen space setback all developments shall be designed with consideration of a means of linkage with the farmington valley greenway this recreational and commuter corridor is located in east granby just east of the granby town line bisecting property currently owned by griffin land by connecting developments to the greenway the town and the developer will encourage the use of alternate means of commuting to the new business developments particularly by bicycle while providing increased recreational and social opportunities for the business employees greenway connectors may be designed to run adjacent to proposed roadways or be internally located meandering between buildings parking areas and open space greenway connectors will typically have a minimum paved width of 10 feet use districts 4 parking the size of the parking area is dictated by the required number of parking spaces outlined within of these regulations all parking lots shall be designed for the ease and clarity of traffic flow and as an aesthetic design element of the development safe pedestrian movement must also be provided within the parking lot large planting islands are encouraged within the parking areas to reduce visual and audio impacts and the impact of heat while aiding in drainage and snow removal parking areas that are designed in modules separated by landscaped islands are encouraged and will aid in conforming to the design recommendations outlined herein landscaped islands shall contain not less than 360 square feet 18x20 and shall provide a landscaped break between parking spaces as outlined within the commission may permit greater groupings of parking spaces when the size design and placement of the landscape islands demonstrate the desirability of such groupings landscaped islands shall be designed to accommodate plants shrubs and trees particularly maple trees of sufficient size and quantity to meet the above purposes in order to provide the landscape island with sufficient water necessary to support the plant life the applicant in designing the site shall consider recessing the landscape islands below the paved area rather than raised and surrounded with curbing the commission may require recessed islands where design and soil conditions warrant such requirements a portion of the surrounding paved area shall be pitched towards the recessed islands thereby directing storm water to these areas the overall parking lot drainage analyses shall outline the volume of storm water directed to landscape islands in addition to that which is directed into the structural drainage system no more than 50% of the parking area for the entire property shall be located between the front facade of the principal buildings and the primary abutting street the commission may modify this requirement based on the placement of the open space number and actual design of the adjacent streets the size of the parking lot the design of the building and the quality of the overall parking lot design 5 drainageaquifer protection area the ed zone is located within an aquifer protection area the drainage of the parking lots shall recognize the concerns for the aquifer and shall be designed accordingly use districts all parking lots shall discharge storm water to a retention or detention pond which shall be designed to mirror the functions of a natural wetlands in an effort to slow the cfs and to provide for the purification of the storm water before it enters the salmon brook or other drainage way all uses identified above shall be specifically reviewed for compliance with the aquifer protection overlay zone in the event of a conflict between the ed zone regulations and the aquifer protection overlay zone regulations the latter shall take precedence 6 retail development while retail development is permitted as a special permit use within the ed zone additional regulations have been established to promote the establishment of smaller retail operators that can more readily serve the employees and diverse users of the businesses within the ed zone individual business within the ed zone may occupy no more than 40000 square feet of retail space except that the commission may permit up to 75000 square feet when at least two thirds of the voting members vote in favor of the increase in determining whether or not to allow the square footage to exceed 40000 square feet the commission shall consider the building design the site characteristics the compatibility of the structure with surrounding buildings the quality of building materials and the quantity and quality of the landscape materials all of which can aid in reducing the visual bulk and mass of the building retail uses shall be limited to the hours of  am to  pm and the commission may further restrict the hours of the retail development based on the specific proposal for use while retail buildings may exceed 40000 square feet in overall area the design of the building shall be broken up in appearance in an effort to make the buildings appear to be of a much smaller scale this design will come about by using and applying the design guidelines outline in to prevent the ed zone from being dominated by retail uses a strict limit on the overall square footage for retail use is as follows the total square footage of retail use shall be limited to 4% of the total square footage of land area existing on any property or lot where the retail use is proposed for example a 10acre lot can accommodate no more than 17424 square feet of retail use 43560 x 10 acres   435600 square feet x 04   17424 square feet of retail use use districts 7 diversification of uses as stated in care must be taken to diversify the land uses within the ed zone in order to limit the impact of peak hour traffic volumes additionally the diversification of commercial uses is a goal of the towns plan of conservation and development the commission must be diligent in its consideration of special permit uses within the ed zone should the commission find that particular special permit uses are beginning to dominate the zone it must reject future such applications until a more adequate mix of uses begins to evolve 8 building design review the zoning regulations currently contain building design guidelines outlined within these regulations however based on a recommendation of the ed zone subcommittee the commission upon adoption of these regulations will begin the process of establishing a building design review board which will serve as an advisory board to the commission prior to the establishment of a permanent board the commission will establish a preliminary board of at least 3 members who are licensed design professionals these preliminary members shall prepare detailed operating and design guidelines for review and possible adoption by the commission upon adoption all buildings proposed within the ed zone shall be reviewed by the drb and the board shall provide the commission with appropriate recommendations until such time that a permanent drb is established together with all operating and design guidelines any proposed development within the ed zone shall be reviewed by the commission and the guidelines as outlined within the drb shall make recommendations to the planning and zoning commission concerning new development applications but shall not have any independent decisionmaking authority 9 site lighting site lighting shall be designed as the absolute minimum necessary to achieve the desired purpose light pollution and excessively bright or intrusive lighting is a concern in the town of granby lighting plans shall include the height and type of poles the design of the fixtures primarily those that provide full horizon shading the wattage and type of lighting and a written justification with citation to published standards by authoritive sources for the amount and type of lighting proposed lighting plans shall also include an illumination profile outlining the level of lighting in footcandles produced throughout the site lighting shall be a specific design element of the development comprehensively planned with uniformity of poles fixtures and lighting metal halide lighting shall be considered for use throughout the ed zone use districts 10 noise noise is a community concern and should be considered and measures taken to reduce its impact in the design of all developments the large and undeveloped nature of the ed zone provides the developer with the opportunity to locate buildings loading docks dumpsters and parking areas in a manner that will reduce the impact of noise on surrounding properties particularly residential properties care should be taken to buffer areas of potential noise by shielding such areas strategic placement of buildings earth berms or combination of these and other appropriate techniques 11 bufferingtransition of uses the town is concerned about the impact of future development on existing residential properties the requirements of the above sections will aid in reducing the negative impact of ed zone uses on residential properties the ed zone permitted uses and the uses outlined in 4 given proper site design are suitable to properly transition the ed zone use from the residential use this is less clear with a number of the other ed zone uses therefore developments that are to be within 1000 feet of a residential zone must be of a use and design chosen with consideration of the impact on the nearby residential properties more compatible ed zone uses such as offices shall generally be preferred within these areas to the more intense ed zone uses such as retail sales 12 outside storage no goods merchandise equipment or machinery shall be stored or displayed outside of a building unless the areas are specifically authorized by the commission as a part of a site plan or special permit approval parking spaces and landscaping areas shall not be used for sales storage display of

except for offstreet loading periodic sidewalk sales and other operations normally conducted outdoors and excepting other uses specifically authorized by the commission as part of a site plan or special permit approval 13 the provisions of of these regulations are incorporated by reference into this as if set forth in full herein use districts 14 in the ed zone lots may be established in accordance with f herein when lots are created on newly constructed town roads no lot may be approved under this section unless all of the lot lines that make up the parcel are set back a minimum of 500 feet from salmon brook street and floydville road the minimum criteria that follow are reductions in the requirements outlined within while the commission may approve lots that comply with the reduced criteria all subdivided lots must be in compliance with the subdivision regulations and all zoning regulations not specifically reduced herein minimum a lot area 50000 sq feet  b frontage 50

to avoid the development of small commercial establishments along route 10 elimination of an existing commercial strip zone the t1 zone encourages comprehensive development and the cooperation of individual landowners a primary goal of the zone is to avoid the establishment of commercial curb cuts along route 10 while requiring that new commercial buildings be placed at least 100 feet back from salmon brook street the t1 zone is designed to provide a transition of uses from high intensity commercial use to residential use this transition can be achieved by combining existing lots limiting new curb cuts along route 10 limiting the size of commercial buildings regulating the style and quality of construction and establishing buffer areas the objective is to create a unified commercial or mixed use area developed with an internal service road all applications for development within the t1 zone must take into account this concept for an internal roadway designs that will prevent the possibility of bringing this concept to fruition shall not be approved the transitional zone is created in recognition of the commercial growth that is occurring in this area the relocation of the canton road intersection the availability of public water and public sewer and the towns overall success in limiting curb cuts and managing traffic flow within the overall area use districts the following regulations and standards are designed to bring about the above goal  permitted uses the following uses are permitted 1 singlefamily dwellings  2 home occupations subject to

general welfare of its citizenry therefore the planning and zoning commission of the town of granby connecticut does ordain as follows  finding of fact the flood hazard areas of the town of granby are subject to periodic flood inundation which results in the loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damage uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains can adversely affect the community the town of granby has voluntarily participated in the national flood insurance program nfip since  the nfip is founded on a mutual agreement between the federal government and each participating community local state and federal governments must share roles and responsibilities to meet the goals and objectives of the nfip the communitys role is of paramount importance property owners are able to receive federallysubsidized flood insurance only if the community enacts and enforces the minimum floodplain regulations required for participation in the nfip  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this regulation to regulate floodplain development promote public health safety and general welfare and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed  to protect human life and health and prevent damage to property   to minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects   to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public   to minimize prolonged business interruptions and other economic disruptions   to minimize damage to public facilities infrastructure and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in the floodplain   to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas in such a manner as to minimize flood damage and flood blight areas   to insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area   to prevent increase in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners   to ensure that those who occupy the flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions  and  to discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity use or structure outside of the floodplain  objectives in order to accomplish its purposes this regulation includes objectives methods and provisions that a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to flood or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of barriers or obstructions which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  effective date of regulations the effective date of these regulations is  as amended to   definitions area of
