codified ordinances of harrison ohio  charter  part one  administrative three  traffic five  general offenses seven  business regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention s note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances   the comparative is included to show the disposition of every ordinance included in the codified ordinances it indicates whether a given ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more sections cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter  general index editors note references are to individual code sections as additional aids for locating material users are directed to athe comparative table which indicates in the codified ordinances the disposition of the ordinances or

offense bwhen the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense the fact that one subsection of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability c1when language defining an element of an offense that is related to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to

three 3 different building scale classifications to provide regulations to manage the scale of construction in the district in a way that preserves and protects the traditional urban fabric and scale of downtown harrison allows for architecture that responds to modern construction practices and maintains an inviting and functional pedestrian environment building scale applies to existing structures and infill development a small scale buildings are of the smallest scale have delicate proportions and often have side yards and small front yards architecture tends to relate strongly to the human or pedestrian scale and has many characteristics of or was built as a home these buildings contain intimate spaces b medium scale buildings are of a medium scale have bold proportions that are inviting for a pedestrian and relate strongly to civic and commercial architecture designed to draw people in while accommodating a variety of business uses gatherings and residential units c large scale buildings are of the largest scale have very bold and strong proportions that convey a presence within the district these proportions relate strongly to industrial warehousing office larger hotels or residential buildings they accommodate significant internal uses and spaces and may have limited pedestrian street presence d architectural standards for existing buildings 1 purpose the purpose of the architectural standards for existing structures is to provide guidance for the appropriate restoration and rehabilitation of contributing historic or established buildings in the downtown redevelopment district in accordance with the districts traditional function as the business and cultural hub of the city 2 applicability the following standards shall apply to all existing buildings in the downtown redevelopment district to account for the districts eclectic mix of architecture and uses standards are provided by styles as defined below for the rehabilitation of existing buildings that contribute to the intent of this district or are historically significant modifications which meet the requirements of the administration process to buildings identified as a

buildings identified in harrison as a registered ohio or national historic landmark or as a contributing structure to the historic district shall be subject to review by the state historic preservation office in addition to the planning commission 3 contributing existing building styles defined a commercialmixeduse style contributing commercialmixeduse buildings were designed to house retail business offices hotels restaurant theatres or other similar uses the style of commercialmixeduse buildings have transformed over generations but the proper style for the downtown redevelopment district is a multistory building often with a store front and upper stories to accommodate additional businesses or residential units most of these buildings were built from 1850 1930  however more modern buildings can also meet these qualifications the images in illustration a are examples of contributing commercialmixeduse style buildings in the downtown redevelopment district   images0003541jpg illustration a contributing commercialmixed use style building b industrial style structures contributing industrial style buildings were originally built to house manufacturing warehousing processing or to handle heavy equipment or automotive uses these buildings are typically large in scale and were designed for utilitarian purposes and handling of materials they may or may not include offices they are often more accessible by vehicles than pedestrian users most of these buildings were built from 1850 to 1940 the images in illustration b are examples of contributing industrial style buildings in the downtown redevelopment district   images0003547jpg illustration b contributing industrial style buildings re kaiser hardware building located in west harrison indiana is a good example of desirable architecture in harrison c residential style buildings contributing residential style structures are primarily building designed for occupancy as a home or homes some of these buildings in the downtown redevelopment district have been adapted and reused for commercial or civic purposes most were built before 1940 and exhibit a range of architectural styles popular in different eras of the 19th and early 20th century they are typically smaller in scale than commercial or industrial buildings with 2 3 stories common and usually exhibit features such as elevated front porches turrets and pitched roof forms the images in illustration c are examples of contributing residential style buildings in the downtown redevelopment district   images0003554jpg illustration c contributing residential style buildings d civic and institutional style buildings contributing civic and institutional style buildings are designed to accommodate gathering spaces or services that are provided by a public or private entity like governments or religious or educational institutions as their purpose is often between office and gathering spaces these buildings generally do not have storefronts at street level although they do have a monumental entry churches or places of worship have identifying features such as spires towers steeples or domes and can range from small to grand in scale the images in illustration d are examples of contributing civic or institutional style buildings in the downtown redevelopment district   images0003562jpg illustration d

element as closely as possible in size depth and material 2 the existing elements shall be carefully preserved they shall not be made larger or smaller or changed in shape except when all of the elements of the kind eg corbels must be replaced and then some modification from the original is acceptable 3 if the interior ceiling is lower than the transom line either revise the interior ceiling height in the transom area to restore the transparency of the transom or use spandrel glass or detailed rot resistant wood or metal panels similar to the bulkhead design to fill the area where glazing would be present e when original features of the storefront have been completely removed in previous remodeling and no historical reference is available to detennine original pattern and rhythm an appropriate restoration of a traditional storefront shall be completed using the following standards 1 the main or customer entrance to a building shall be emphasized to delineate a clear point of arrival or entry 2 the main entry shall be located along the primary public rightofway corridor  additional entrances may be located in the side or rear of the building to allow for service access or

residential style buildings this section addresses the structures within the downtown redevelopment district that were originally built for the intention of a residential use these buildings have character defining features that should be maintained i architectural elements the use of architectural elements and details in residential style buildings is unique and specific to the era in which the building was constructed a during remodeling or restoration original architectural elements and details should be restored when historic reference is available examples of appropriate and inappropriate remodeling are shown in figure 13519 b original residential style facade elements include 1gabled hipped or compound pitched roofs 2turrets towers chimneys cupolas 3eaves and gutters

smallest on the top the middle set of panels may be combined into one shorter panel viewlights and glass corresponding to the panel design is acceptable b the doors and frames shall be constructed of wood and not metal these doors may either be painted or stained to match the material and color palette c storm doors may be added to residential structures the frame and door shall be wood with thick style and rail members the panels in the doors can either be a glazed panel screened panel or an interchangeable panel solid panels are not acceptable the panels shall either be full door height or divided to correspond to the door panels d both styles of architecture typically incorporated a surround into the design of the overall door transoms and sidelights can be included in the surround iii extensions and enclosures a extensions into a front or side yard with frontage on a public rightofway or enclosure of an original porch shall be prohibited b the original detailing proportions and elevations of porches should be maintained and restored in rehabilitation or renovation projects iv stoops porches and porticoes a the residential structures within the downtown redevelopment district have either a small uncovered stoop or portico an extension of the door surround or a porch b the stoops are traditionally small and either had a simple iron railing or no rail at all due to code restrictions the design of any porches stoops and railings must comply with the local and state building code c a onestory portico may project anywhere from one 1 foot to four 4 feet from the face of the structure and extends one 1 to two 2 feet to either side of the door the roof of the portico can be flat or pediment and covers a rectangular area the roof can take an alternate shape but this is uncommon d the configuration of the porches shall be onestory structures with low slope or flat roofs and occasionally a gallery above is common the galleries were typically decorative in nature and ran the whole width and depth of the porch due to code restrictions the design of any balustrades and railings must comply with the local and state building code the porch could be placed just at the entry and extend any distance up to the full width of the facade porches can wrap around one 1 or two 2 corners v shutters any shutters that are applied shall be wood or solid composite operable and fit the opening to which they are adjacent example a fourfoot 4 wide window shall not have two 2 onefoot wide shutters each shutter folded or shutter panel shall be thirty five to one hundred percent 35100% of the width of the window so that when opened it could cover the whole window do not use shutters and awnings for the same window d civicinstitutional style buildings i roof shapes slopes and materials that are visible from street level shall be compatible with the historic style of the building the roof forms can take one of two 2 forms flatlow slope screen by a parapet wall or gabled or hipped with a slope between an 812 and 1212 slope these two 2 common roof forms emphasize the rectangular box form of the style ii many different materials can be used for the cladding material of the roof some shingles are shaped into wedges scales and other forms these decorative shapes shall be avoided so there is a distinction between old and new the shingles may be varied in color and placed in a random pattern the shingles shall not be placed in such a manner as to create a particular design the colors used on the roof shall be compatible with the color scheme chosen for the rest of the structure a slate shingles may be used on steeper sloped roofs synthetic shingles with a slate appearance may also be used b metal roofs of a true traditional raised seam profile with flat panels is an acceptable material the metal can be a natural finish or a prefinished color the colors used on the roof shall be compatible with the color scheme chosen for the rest of the structure c membrane roof systems are allowable for use on flat roofs only iii entries and street front facades defined entry features such as porticos and recessed architectural features will be encouraged to provide diversity along the first floor while providing patrons a recognizable point of entry the designs shall be articulated use of historic proportions for the columns lower panels transoms area of glazing and intermediate cornice the columns and intermediate cornices can be a simplified version of earlier designs if the historic features are missing or a new structure is being constructed the use of aluminum storefront systems will be allowed iv fenestration arrangement of windows & doors the entry door to civicinstitutional style structure can be either a single or double leaf panel door the door shall be prominent on the facade and located centered within architectural bay rhythm of the street facade or central on the facade the door should have between two 2 and six 6 panels the upper panel of the door may be solid or glazed and is typically shaped to match the profile of the top of the door viewlights and glass corresponding to the panel design is acceptable a the doors and frames shall be constructed of wood or metal these doors may either be painted or stained to match the material and color palette b the window configuration is a mix of fixed and double hung configurations double hung windows are the most common type of windows in most cases both the upper and lower sash were operable so the wind patterns structure could be varied 1 any glass within eighteen 18 inches from the finished floor must be safety rated 2 all operable windows within thirtysix 36 inches of the finished floor must have a maximum opening of four 4 inches c the common sash divisions for the double hung windows are 11 and 22 religious structures can have further divisions and integrated stained glass d the use of insulated glass and storm windows is allowed any divided storm windows shall have the sash lines aligned with those of the window wood wood clad aluminum and factory finished aluminum windows will be allowed e the windows are to be placed symmetrically within the facade also to create a balance the facade was divided into an odd number of bays with one vertical set of windows pertaining to each bay typically each window is placed individually not in a pair or set f the lintels and sills may be brick concrete stone or cast stone the lintel shall be flat keyed or arched thin stone sills of four 4 to six 6 inches are encouraged lintels shall be approximately 15 times thicker than the sills and four 4 to eight 8 inches wider on each end e architectural standards for new structures 1 purpose to promote the design and construction of new mixeduse and nonresidential buildings that support and enhance the scale and function of the downtown redevelopment district and to create a theme that complements the citys existing built environment 2 facade articulation a the way a buildings facade is designed to emphasize certain elements or portions of the facade is a factor in the overall character of the building buildings in the downtown redevelopment district shall respect the established scale and function of the district and of the scale of adjacent buildings b facades shall be articulated both vertically and horizontally to relate the structure to the scale of the adjacent buildings c the following standards shall apply to new buildings as specified i horizontal articulation horizontally long facades shall be visually and physically broken into bays bays shall be demarcated using arecesses or setback variations b architectural detailing c fenestration pattern and rhythm d various facade heights e architectural elements and detailing including but not limited to pilasters that subdivide the facade and f application of compatible building materials to cause the facade to appear as a series of proportionally correct masses see illustration m   images0003679jpg illustration m these three elevations illustrate proper and improper articulation and proportions for buildings in the district ii maximum bay width shall be determined by the overall building proportions and scale as follows a large scale30 feet in width b medium scale20 feet c small scale15 feet iii a minimum of three 3 bays shall be used on large and medium scale buildings a minimum of two 2 bays may be used on small scale buildings iv bays shall be created using no fewer than two 2 of the following methods a change in wall plane such as a projection or recess the change in depth from one bay to the next shall be at least three percent 3% of the length of the facade b change in height of wall andor variation in roof form c change in texture or masonry pattern d window placement or form v placement of the common horizontal elements eg cornice line and window height width and spacing on new structures shall be influenced by neighboring structures these elements include window moldings tops of display windows cornices copings and parapets when topography or lack of existing buildings in the same block does not create a consistent horizontal component the

applied to cover transitions in materials and provide finish to a faccade 1trim shall be of an appropriate type and scale to convey an architectural style for a building generally narrow trim should be used on smaller elements and on smaller buildings while wider trim should be use on larger structures 2trim should be used around facade openings to add dimension and emphasis 3trim should be a contrasting color to the primary facade to help define the facade openings and articulation however the city may approve noncontrasting trim and detailing if it enhances the articulation and character of the structure b detailing detailing refers to other elements that are installed attached painted or applied to the exterior of a building or structure for the purpose of ornamentation or artistic expression and assist in the articulation of a facade adding dimension or character some features included in detailing are   images0003932jpg acornices b projecting eaves c gutters and downspouts d

provide daylighting into interior spaces when building depths or locations limit window placement skylights and interior atriums should be used d energy generating devices such as solar collectors and wind turbines are notable features but they must remain visually subordinate to the traditional character of the building e inclusion of a green roof should be considered to reduce storm water runoff and to reduce the heat island effect f incorporate elements that allow for passive cooling such as operable windows for natural ventilation and the introduction of solar screens to block out intense heat g the use of locally manufactured sourced and recycled materials is encouraged to reduce fuel consumption for transportation and reduce costs and fit into the local architectural vernacular by
