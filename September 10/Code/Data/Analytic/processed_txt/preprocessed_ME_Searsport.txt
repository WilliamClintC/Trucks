floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result b variances shall be granted only upon 1 a showing of good and sufficient cause  and 2 a determination that should a flood comparable to the base flood occur the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety public expense or create nuisances cause fraud or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local jaws or ordinances  and 3 a showing that the issuance of the variance will not conflict with other state federal or local jaws or ordinances  and 4 a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in undue hardship which in this subsection means a that the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a variance is granted  and b that the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood  and c that the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality  and 14 d that the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner c variances shall only be issued upon a determination that

restoration of historic structures upon the determination that 1 the development meets the criteria of paragraphs a above  and 2 the proposed repair reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure f any applicant who meets the criteria of paragraphs a shall be notified by the board of appeals in writing over the signature of the chairman of the board of appeals that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in greatly increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 per $100 of insurance coverage  2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property  and 3 the applicant agrees in writing that the applicant is fully aware of all the risks inherent in the use of land subject to flooding assumes those

is such that the majority of time transceivers properly installed and operated will be able to communicate with the base station without objectionable noise or excessive biterrorrate for digital and without calls being dropped in the case of cellular or personal communications services pcs communications in a rural or nonurban environment this would be a signal strength of at least  92dbm it is acceptable for there to be holes within the area of adequate coverage as long as the signal regains its strength further away from the base station the outer boundary of the area of adequate coverage
