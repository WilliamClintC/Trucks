situation of the current owner of the property  and which amount to more than a mere inconvenience to the owner bnot exclusively for financial gain the purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a desire to increase financial gain from the property proof that the property cannot be used for its highest or best use under the regulations shall not in itself justify granting a variance
