ordinance adopted   an ordinance adopted   an ordinance adopted   an ordinance adopted   the   an ordinance adopted   an ordinance adopted   adopted   and adopted  purpose statement the city of dover recognizes that manufactured homes are a unique housing type with their own history of placement and ownership traditions arising from their origins as mobile homes a modern manufactured home does not resemble a vehicle and once placed is rarely moved however most manufactured homes are owned as if they were vehicles separate from the land they are placed on and may theoretically be moved at any time because of this the city recognizes that consistent standards are needed for placement licensing and tracking of manufactured homes in order to ensure the homes orderly movement into out of and around the city the city further recognizes that land lease communities which may give ground lease to manufactured homes or other types of housing typify a use of land which does not align perfectly with either apartments or residential subdivisions because of this areas of responsibility on the part of residents owners and the city with regard to maintenance communication and taxation can be unclear without the adoption of consistent standards governing these areas of responsibility the city recognizes that where responsibility is not clearly claimed detrimental conditions can arise for residents this chapter therefore lays out consistent standards needed for manufactured homes and land lease communities while updating and consolidating earlier city regulations regarding mobile homes and mobile home parks the standards are intended to be applicable to all land lease communities currently in the city or which may be established in the future they are also intended to cover both manufactured homes and permanently placed manufactured homes and the issues unique to each they are intended to supplement rather than replace all state laws regulating manufactured homes including

convenience levels are extremely poor and driver or pedestrian frustration is generally high operations at this level are usually unstable because small increases in flow or minor perturbations within the traffic stream will cause functional failures beyond acceptable levels the conditions described in this subsection are also used to describe level of service e as defined by the highway capacity
