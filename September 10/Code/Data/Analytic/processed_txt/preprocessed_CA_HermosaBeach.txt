according to the humane society of the united states american consumers purchase dogs and cats from pet stores that the consumers believe to be healthy and genetically sound but in reality the animals often face an array of health problems including communicable diseases or genetic disorders that present immediately after sale or that do not surface until several years later all of which lead to costly veterinary bills and distress to consumers g a review of state and usda inspection reports from more than 100 breeders who sold animals to the nations largest retail pet store chain revealed that more than 60 percent of the inspections found serious violations of basic animal care standards including sick or dead animals in their cages lack of proper veterinary care inadequate shelter from weather conditions and dirty unkempt cages that were too small h a 2005 undercover investigation of california pet stores revealed that nearly half of the pet shops visited displayed animals that showed visible signs of illness injury or neglect and nearly half of the stores also sold animals showing clear symptoms of psychological distress i according to the humane society of the united states hundreds of thousands of dogs and cats in the united states have been housed and bred at substandard breeding facilities known as puppy mills or kitten factories that massproduce animals for sale to the public  and many of these animals are sold at retail in pet stores because of the lack of proper animal husbandry practices at these facilities animals born and raised there are more likely to have genetic disorders and lack adequate socialization while breeding animals utilized there are subject to inhumane housing conditions and are indiscriminately disposed of when they reach the end of their profitable breeding cycle j according to usda inspection reports some additional documented problems found at puppy mills include 1 sanitation problems leading to infectious disease 2 large numbers of animals overcrowded in cages 3 lack of proper veterinary care for severe illnesses and injuries 4 lack of protection from harsh weather conditions 5 lack of adequate food and water k while puppy mill puppies and kitten factory kittens were being sold in pet stores across the los angeles area during the past year more than 35000 dogs and 67000 cats were euthanized in los angeles city and county shelters l the homeless pet problem notwithstanding there are many reputable dog and cat breeders who refuse to sell stores and who work carefully to screen families and ensure good lifelong matches m responsible dog and cat breeders do not sell their animals to pet stores the united kennel club ukc the second oldest allbreed registry of purebred dog pedigrees in the united states and the second largest in the world asks all of its member breeders to agree to a ethics which includes a pledge not to sell their puppies to pet stores similar pledges are included in codes of ethics for many breed clubs for individual breeds n within the past year there has been significant community activity across the los angeles metropolitan area to convince local pet store operators to convert from puppy sales to a humane business model offering adoptable homeless dogs and cats to their customers o across the country thousands of independent pet stores as well as large chains operate profitably with a business model focused on the sale of pet services and supplies and not on the sale of dogs and cats many of these stores collaborate with local animal sheltering and rescue organizations to offer space and support for showcasing adoptable homeless pets on their premises p while the city council recognizes that not all dogs and cats retailed in pet stores are products of inhumane breeding conditions and would not classify every commercial breeder selling dogs or cats to pet stores as a puppy mill or kitten factory it is the city councils belief that puppy mills and kitten factories continue to exist in part because of public demand and the sale of dogs and cats in pet stores q the city council finds that the retail sale of dogs and cats in pet stores that operate or choose in the future to operate in the city of hermosa beach must be consistent with the citys goal to be a community that cares about animal welfare r the city council believes that eliminating the retail sale of dogs and cats in pet stores in the city will promote community awareness of animal welfare and in turn will foster a more humane environment in the city s the city

provisions for new development and redevelopment projects by incorporating the substantive elements of the stormwater provisions of green building standards into this chapter g the city of hermosa beach is small in geographic area comprising 14 square miles accordingly it is reasonable to simplify the determination of the stormwater quality design volume for new development and redevelopment projects by adopting a single design storm depth applicable to all project sites within the city while meeting the intent of the municipal npdes permit the stormwater quality design volume is defined by the municipal npdes permit as the greater of either the runoff from the 075 inch twentyfour 24 hour rain event or the eightyfifth percentile twentyfour 24 hour storm as determined from the los angeles county eightyfifth percentile precipitation isohyetal map according to the referenced map the largest eightyfifth percentile twentyfour 24 hour rain event within the city of hermosa beach is approximately 077 inches thus to simplify regulatory requirements and streamline the project review process the city of hermosa beach has determined to define the stormwater quality design volume as

are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by provisions designed to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruptions  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  g ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes regulations to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction

which carry debris potential projectiles and erosion potential the following provisions apply a until a regulatory floodway is adopted no new construction substantial development or other development including fill shall be permitted within zones a130 and ae unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than 1 foot at any point within the city of hermosa beach b within an adopted regulatory floodway the city of hermosa beach shall prohibit

encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge c if a & b are satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of   nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of hermosa beach to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond one half acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city of hermosa beach need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city of hermosa beach believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given

for planning commission review 1 general guidelines to allow projects which exceed any of the first tier standards the overall building and project design should be of a superior quality be compatible with surrounding properties and be designed in scale with the community the planning commission shall consider the following in making this determination a the building should be designed with interesting architectural features and materials to enhance the overall project a threedimensional quality should be emphasized by the use of stepping architectural features to avoid massive flat building faces special attention should be given to the appearance of the building from the street b landscaping should be utilized throughout the site in a manner which enhances the building and the site and to mitigate the visual impacts of any flat andor massive parts of the building c the project should be compatible with neighboring projects with respect to height scale bulk proportion this is not a prescription for similar architectural styles although in some cases it may be desirable nor a prescription to match existing buildings as many existing buildings do not stand scrutiny under these guidelines d architectural renderings and perspectives must be submitted to show the threedimensional quality of the proposed buildings 2 height to allow projects to exceed the first tier height limits the building design should incorporate features to minimize and break up the visual impact and view impacts of the higher structures on neighboring residential areas and on the streetscape the planning commission shall consider the following guidelines in making this determination a limit lot coverage of uppermost level the area of the portion of the structure which exceeds the first tier height limit should not cover a major portion of the lot area and said overheight area should be compensated by a proportional area of the building which is at or less than the height limit b flat roofs and flat tall vertical walls should be avoided stepped variable or sloping roofs should be encouraged the appearance of flat roofs and massive flat vertical walls should be avoided use of stepping or tiered architectural features c greater setbacks for upper levels progressing from the first floor to the uppermost story of the building setbacks from the rear property line should increase and exceed minimum requirements and the upper stories shall have tiered setbacks from the lower levels as viewed from the front 3 bulk to allow projects which exceed the maximum floor arealot area ratio far the building design should incorporate features to minimize the appearance of bulk and to compensate for the bulk of a building with attractive architectural features which enhance the building and which reduce the visual impact of large areas of flat vertical walls the planning commission shall consider the following guidelines in making this determination a avoid boxlike structures significant and attractive architectural features should be used to break up the bulky appearance of boxlike structures b building stepbacks stepins and stepouts should be used on the front of the building to break up the bulky appearance this could accompany varying widths of the landscape planter area in the front of the building c variable heights the roofline of the building should be designed with variable heights and roof patterns or materials to avoid the appearance of a flat building 4 landscaping the objective of the landscaping requirement is to enhance the overall project including the streetscape to complement the building design to break up the impact of vast expanses of pavement to buffer sound and visual impacts on neighboring residential areas to provide shade for parking areas and to deflect direct sunlight into the interior of buildings to allow less than the minimum five percent coverage a landscaping plan must compensate for the loss of coverage by providing a superior design use of types quantity and location of plant materials to achieve the objectives described above c general criteria in considering the precise development plan for any development the following criteria for granting or conditionally granting said permit shall be considered 1 distance from existing residential uses in relation to negative effects  2 impact on ocean
