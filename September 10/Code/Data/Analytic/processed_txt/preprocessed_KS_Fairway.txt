facilities of the standard specifications and design criteria of the kansas city metropolitan the american public works association dated  is hereby incorporated by reference for the purpose of regulating the design of improvements with respect to stormwater runoff 2 4 of the storm drainage systems and facilities of the standard specifications and design criteria of the kansas city metropolitan the american public works association dated  are hereby repealed and new 4 are added to read as follows additions are denoted with double asterisks  b general guidelines 1 natural channels are to be preserved to the maximum extent practicable as site conditions permit design standards for natural channels are addressed in engineered channels the next highest priority system component shall be designated and coordinated with the design of building lots and streets in accordance with the design criteria and performance standards addressed in 2 to the maximum extent possible drainage systems street layout and grades lot patterns and placement of curbs inlets and site drainage and overflow swales shall be concurrently designed in accordance with the design criteria and performance standards set forth in this document curb and gutter may be omitted or modified where approved by the citycounty engineer and deemed feasible in conjunction with other stormwater management practices including water quality bmps 3 enclosed conveyance systems consisting of inlets conduits and manholes may be used to convey stormwater runoff where site conditions and open space requirements will not permit the use of natural or engineered channels where used these systems must be designed in accordance with design criteria and performance standards addressed in 4 generally a public storm drainage system is constructed when the peak discharge is greater than eight 8 cfs for the ten percent 10% design storm and the drainage is generated by more than one 1 lot or the drainage area is greater than two 2 acres c open systems  where feasible open systems consisting of open or engineered channels shall be used if all of the following design criteria and the conditions of are met 1 the channel slope is less than or equal to five percent 5% or where appropriate armoring techniques are used to prevent erosion  or 2 the fifty percent 50% design storm

culverts and similar underground structures shall be used to convey stormwater at all locations whenever one 1 of the following design criteria and the conditions of are met 1 where natural channels or open systems are not feasible per the requirements set forth in a1  or 2 within the rightofway of streets with curbs regardless of system design capacity e stormwater management  1 new development or redevelopment as defined in shall incorporate stormwater management measures to control runoff from the site the allowable runoff is defined by the volume timing and peak rate of runoff and is dependent on the watershed characteristics allowable runoff may be limited by the need to minimize flood damage prevent erosion andor minimize impacts to the ecology and water quality of the downstream drainage system 2 stormwater management for site development may include structural facilities andor nonstructural solutions the developer shall evaluate the site development plan according to the flowchart in figure 56011 this chart provides decision criteria for determining the potential impacts of the site on the watershed beginning with the hexagonshaped dialog box in the upper left of the chart check the requirements as indicated then proceed to the next dialog box to the right determine the yes or no answer to the question in the dialog box and continue to next box to the right or below according to the answer where runoff controls are required lowimpact development practices or offsite control of runoff in addition to or instead of the standard wet or dry bottom basins may be used see e15b 3 notwithstanding the foregoing it is the opinion of the city that any development will degrade water quality cause stream erosion and contribute to adverse ecological impacts therefore at the discretion of 4 flood problems are defined as one 1 or more of the following conditions a homes buildings or other structures downstream from a proposed development are flooded in a one percent 1% or more frequent flood  b flood damage problem areas for the one percent 1% or more frequent flood have been identified or an engineering study indicated the proposed development would

for a development project shall include an analysis of the existing downstream drainage system to the point the developments land mass is less than ten percent 10% of the total watershed unless waived by the citycounty the citycounty may require additional analysis of the downstream drainage system to identify flooding problems especially in sensitive areas or where flooding has occurred downstream 5 if flooding problems will occur as defined in e4 of this section runoff from the development shall be controlled by limiting the stormwater release rates for the one percent 1% ten percent 10% and one hundred percent 100% design storms to the predevelopment peak flow rates for the one percent 1% ten percent 10% and one hundred percent 100% storms respectively if flooding problems will not occur detention of the one percent 1% storm will not be allowed 6 additionally the citycounty may require a study to verify downstream predevelopment peak flow rates are not increased at specific downstream locations due to the development some communities may also establish more stringent release rates in sensitive watersheds f overflow systems each conveyance element of the stormwater drainage system whether open enclosed or detention shall include an overflow element when the insystem capacity defined in is exceeded the overflow element shall be designed to route the surcharge downstream types of overflow systems are sitedependent and may include streets channels overland surfaces redundant piping or spillways or combinations thereof the insystem capacity combined with the overflow system

 rights are that are important constitutional rights that must be protected unregulated signage however has direct and secondary effects that are harmful to the safety and general welfare of the city as a whole and to its individual citizens these direct and secondary effects result from the visual clutter that occurs as a result of the unregulated installation and lack of maintenance of signs and include harm to traffic and pedestrians safety depreciation of property values within the city decreased business opportunities for individual and business residents of the city resulting in decreased sales property and other tax revenues that are necessary to provide an adequate level of public service to city residents community blight and an overall less pleasing community appearance because of these direct and secondary effects the city has a compelling interest in regulating signs within the city for the most part these regulations are content and viewpointneutral reasonable time manner and place restrictions that directly advance the citys stated interests and are not designed to discourage of prevent any particular message or suppress disadvantage or impose differential burdens on speech because of its content and are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech to the extent that certain provisions of these regulations make contentbased distinctions those distinctions are reasonably related to a contentneutral purpose the scope of the regulations is proportionate to the interests served a reasonable fit with the citys interests and narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective furthermore a direct nexus exists between the desired citys goals and the means chosen in these regulations to achieve its desired goals each exemption in these regulations is based on objective factors relevant to each particular exemption does not draw distinctions based on the content of the sign does not create competition for limited space for signs or preclude the placement of another sign and is reasonably related to the legitimate stated interests of these regulations temporary signs have certain characteristics that distinguish them from many of the other types of signs permitted and regulated by the city specifically including the fact that many of these signs do not meet the regular structural and insulation requirements necessary to prevent them from being affected by weather and other natural forces and therefore present a potential hazard to persons and property  severe weather conditions including without limitation thunderstorms with accompanying high winds tornadoes ice accumulation and flooding are characteristic of local weather conditions a primary and compelling interest of the city is the ability of the city other governmental entities and utilities to erect official signs and other warnings to protect the public without being subject to regulation and to allow property owners to display legal postings without being subject to regulation so that the information is conveyed to the public to protect the public safety and welfare to promote vehicular and pedestrian safety on private property by allowing directional signs to be posted without being subject to regulation the safety and security from harm of residents families and homes displaying the existence of home security systems and neighborhood watch programs and the ability of the police and fire departments to easily identify residents or addresses in emergency situations and therefore necessitate the ability of residents and

statutory authorization 1 approval of draft ordinance by the state chief engineer prior to adoption the following floodplain management regulations as written were approved in draft form by the chief engineer of the division of water resources of the kansas department of agriculture on  2 state statutory authorization the state legislature has in ksa 12741 et seq  and specifically in ksa 12766 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare b findings of fact 1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by a the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and b the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this division uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this division is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this division the base flood is the flood that is estimated to have a one percent 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any one 1 year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto b calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood c computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot 1 at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this division to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in b1 of this section  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 cfr 5922a3  and to meet the requirements of 44 cfr 603d and kar 5444 by applying the provisions of this division to 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities that serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction  and 3 protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard development    general provisions a lands to which division applies this division shall apply to all lands within the
