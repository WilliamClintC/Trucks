plumbers licensed to perform plumbing work in the state any sewer connection made by an authorized licensed plumber shall be inspected by the potw director after the work has been completed and prior to the time the connection is covered passed 761993 division 3 user charge system  21141 user charges aauthority pursuant to the provisions of pub l no 92500  240b and subsequent amendments to it the city having received environmental protection agency financial assistance for the construction of treatment works shall adopt a system of charges to assure that each user pays a share of the annual administration operation and maintenance including replacement costs of the potw bintent the intent of the user charges is to equitably distribute the cost of administration operation and maintenance of the potw to each user proportional to the amount of wastewater treatment service each user receives  and to promote selfsufficiency of the potw with respect to administration operation and maintenance costs cdefinition the term replacement referred to in subsection a above is defined as those expenditures for obtaining and installing equipment accessories or appurtenances that are necessary during the service life of the treatment works to maintain the treatment works capacity and performance the term operation and maintenance includes replacement duser class each user shall be charged a share of the treatment works operation and maintenance cost based on the measured proportional contribution to the treatment works loading generally the user charge will be dependent upon flow insofar as bod cod tss and other pollutant contributions discharged by all users are approximately equal where pollutants exceed the range of concentration of these pollutants in normal domestic sewage a surcharge will be added to the base charge the models used in calculating the user charge are defined in subsection f below charges for flow to the treatment plant not directly attributable to the users shall be distributed among all users of the treatment plant based upon the volume of flow of the users euser charge criteria the user charge system shall be approved by the regional administrator of the environmental protection agency and shall be maintained by the city in accordance with the following requirements 1the user charge system must result in the distribution of the cost of operation and maintenance of treatment works within the city jurisdiction to each user or user class in proportion to the users contribution to the total wastewater loading of the treatment works factors such as strength volume and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included as the basis for the users contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of operation and maintenance costs to each user or user class 2the user charge system must generate sufficient revenue to offset the cost of all treatment works operation and maintenance provided by the city fmodel user charge system 1the user charge system adopted by the city shall result in the equitable distribution of annual treatment works administration operation and maintenance costs to each user or user class in approximate proportion to each users or user class contribution towards the total wastewater loading of the treatment works the following user charge models shall be used for this purpose 2the symbols used in the models are as defined below acf   total fixed operation and maintenance o & m costs per unit of time  bct   total variable operation and maintenance o & m costs per

3models amodel no 1 whereas the treatment works is primarily flow dependent as the bod suspended solids and other pollutant concentrations discharged by the majority of users are approximately equal  therefore the user charge will be developed on a volume basis in accordance with the model below  c u        cf     +      vu ct       no of users      vt  bmodel no 2 when determined by the city that

operation and maintenance model no 1 shall include all costs for operation and maintenance associated with extraneous flows not attributable to any one user class thereby distributing these costs to all users iother considerations user charges may be established based on a percentage of the charge for water usage however the unit rate sewer charge for the largest volume users must be as great as or greater than the unit cost of operation and maintenance excluding debt service in any event a surcharge shall still be levied in accordance with the provisions of model no 2 above the system of user charges for the wastewater treatment system shall be based on total annual system costs including operation and maintenance expenses jnotification each user shall be notified no less often than annually of the rates for user charges the notification shall be done in conjunction with a regular bill and if the regular bill also includes charges for other services shall clearly identify the portion of the bill attributable to wastewater user charges kannual review the city council shall review annually the sewage contributions of users the total annual costs of debt service operation and

solar arrays do not count towards impervious allowance in other words the solar arrays are pervious the state definition of builtupon area states builtupon area does not include a wooden slatted deck or pervious or partially pervious paving material to the extent that the paving material absorbs water or allows water to infiltrate paving material therefore if the solar panels can be constructed in such a manner as to promote the effective infiltration of rainfall then they could be considered pervious similar to a slatted deck or pervious pavement the following criteria could be used at a minimum in establishing a solar panel pervious cover 1 panels must be positioned to allow water to run off their surfaces 2 soil with adequate vegetative cover must be maintained under and around the panels 3 the area around the panels must be adequate to ensure proper vegetative growth under and between the panels 738 city of hamlet zoning viii offstreet parking and loading offstreet parking
