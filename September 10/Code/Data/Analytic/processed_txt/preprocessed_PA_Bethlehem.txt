increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation changes the natural hydrologic patterns destroys aquatic habitat elevates aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater can be an important resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality d public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater e federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the

of stormwater management districts  to implement the provisions of the catasauqua creek and lehigh river subbasin 4 monocacy nancy run and saucon creek watershed stormwater management plans the city is hereby divided into article 925 28 stormwater management districts consistent with the lehigh monocacy nancy run and saucon creek release rate maps presented in the plans the boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on an official map which is available for inspection at the city engineers office b description of stormwater management districts  two types of stormwater management districts may be applicable to the municipality namely conditionalprovisional no detention districts and dual release rate districts as described below 1 conditionalprovisional no detention districts  within these districts the capacity of the local runoff conveyance facilities as defined in  must be calculated to determine if adequate capacity exists for this determination the developer must calculate peak flows assuming that the site is developed as proposed and that the remainder of the local watershed is in the existing condition the developer must also calculate peak flows assuming that the entire local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls specified by this larger of the two peak flows calculated will be used in determining if adequate capacity exists if adequate capacity exists to safely transport runoff from the site to the main channel as defined in  these watershed areas may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff without detention facilities if the capacity calculations show that the local runoff conveyance facilities lack adequate capacity the developer shall either use a 100% release rate control or provide increased capacity of downstream elements to convey increased peak flows consistent with p any capacity improvements must be designed to convey runoff from development of all areas tributary to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria specified in d by definition a storm drainage problem area associated with the local runoff conveyance facilities indicates that adequate capacity does not exist sites in these districts are still required to meet all of the water quality requirements in  dual release rate districts  within these districts the 2year postdevelopment peak discharge must be controlled to 30% of the predevelopment 2year runoff peak further the 10year 25year and 100year postdevelopment peak runoff must be controlled to the stated percentage of the predevelopment peak release rates associated with the 10 year events vary from 50% to 100% depending upon location in the watershed for the monocacy creek and nancy run watersheds the original single release rate districts become dual release rate districts due to the channel protection standard requiring developments to meet a 2year 30% release rate passed  article 925 29 92518 stormwater management district implementation provisions a applicants shall provide a comparative pre and postconstruction stormwater management hydrograph analysis for each direction of discharge and for the site overall to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this any stormwater management controls required by this subject to a dual release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for each of the 2 10 25 and 100year return period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology specified in passed  c the exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the twofoot topographic contours provided as part of the drainage plan the district boundaries as originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or in certain instances are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a potential flow obstruction eg road culvert bridge etc the physical feature is the downstream limit of the subarea and the subarea boundary is drawn from that point up slope to each topographic divide along the path perpendicular to the contour lines d any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this use the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow rates 1 natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased runoff associated with a 2year return period event within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion acceptable velocities shall be based upon criteria included in the most current dep erosion and sediment pollution control program manual permissible velocities from the dep manual for selected channels are presented in appendix c of this natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased 25year return period runoff without creating any hazard to persons or property a one hundred 100 year design storm is required where a storm of this return period would likely cause damage to existing or future structures or their contents were it not for implementation of proper storm water management provisions 3 culverts bridges storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in accordance with dep regulations if applicable and at minimum pass the increased 25 year return period runoff article 925 30 e for a proposed development site located within one release rate category subarea the total runoff from the site shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for development sites with multiple directions of runoff discharge individual drainage directions may be designed for up to a 100% release rate so long as the total runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate f for a proposed development site located within two or more release category subareas the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the applicable release rate the calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by subarea an exception to the above may be granted if discharges from multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the site in this case peak discharge in any direction may be a 100% release rate provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate g for a proposed development site located partially within a release rate category subarea and partially within a conditionalprovisional no detention subarea the size of the predevelopment drainage area on a site may not be changed postdevelopment to create potentially adverse conditions on downstream properties except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver procedure h no portion of a site may be regraded between adjacent watersheds except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver procedure i within a release rate category area for a proposed development site which has areas which drain to a closed depressions the design release from the site will be the lesser of a the applicable release rate flow assuming no closed depressions or b the existing peak flow actually leaving the site in cases where b would result in an unreasonably small design release the design discharge of less than or equal to the release rate will be determined by the available downstream conveyance capacity to the main channel calculated using d and the minimum orifice criteria passed  j offsite areas which drain proposed development site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff rates however onsite drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey offsite flows development site using the capacity criteria in d and the detention criteria in in addition to the criteria in section 92518d onsite conveyance systems designed to carry runoff to a detention basin must be able to transport the basins 100year tributary flow either insystem ingutter or over land passed  k for development sites proposed to take place in phases all detention ponds shall be designed to meet the applicable release rates applied to all site areas tributary to the proposed pond discharge direction all site tributary areas will be assumed as developed regardless of whether all site tributary acres are proposed for development article 925 31 at that time an exception shall be sites with multiple detention ponds in series where only the downstream pond must be designed to the stated release rate l where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity differs significantly from the total site area only the proposed impact area shall be subject to the release rate criteria the impact area includes any proposed cover or grading changes m development proposals which recharge or other means do not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged from the site compared to predevelopment are not subject to the release rate provisions of this no harm water quantity option  for any proposed development site not located in a conditional no detention district the developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control including no detention if the developer can prove that special circumstances exist for the proposed development site and that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan special circumstances are defined as any hydrologic or hydraulic aspects of the development itself not specifically considered in the development of the plan runoff control strategy proof of no harm would have to be shown from the development site remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the creek with the lehigh river proof of no harm must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in d if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm justification passed  attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following provisions 1 the peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the design return period storms 2 10 25 and 100year shall be the values from the calibrated watershed models or as calculated by an applicant using an alternate method acceptable to the municipality the flow values from the watershed model would be supplied to the developer by the municipality upon request 2 any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity ie if his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity 3 developerproposed runoff controls which would generate increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would by definition be precluded from successful attempts to prove no harm except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with p passed  article 925 32 any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer to the lehigh valley planning commission and the city engineer for review as part of the drainage plan submission per any extra submission costs resulting from the dual submission and review shall be borne by the developer the developer completely assumes all risks in so much that the submission of no harm requires a rigorous review for its approval and this approval is not guaranteed o regional detention alternatives  for certain areas within the study area it may be more costeffective to provide one control facility for more than one development site than to provide an individual control facility for each development site the initiative and funding for any regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers the design of any regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed the peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined based on the required release rate at the point of discharge peak runoff rates of discharge from a regional detention basin shall be based upon maintaining existing peak runoff rates for the tributary area except that other criteria for discharge may apply for regional detention facilities located within a watershed with a county approved act 167 storm water management plan any developer relying upon regional detention facilities in lieu of onsite controls shall pay an appropriate fee to the owner of the regional facility any proposed regional detention facility shall have the approval of the lehigh valley planning commission as well as the city engineer p capacity improvements  in certain instances primarily within the conditionalprovisional no detention areas local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire watershed in these instances if the developer could prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network then the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff controls on the development site peak flow calculations shall be done assuming that the local watershed is in the existing condition and then assuming that the local watershed is developed per current zoning and using the specified runoff controls any capacity improvements would be designed using the larger of the above peak flows and the capacity criteria specified in d all new development in the entire subareas within which the proposed development site is located shall be assumed to implement the developers proposed discharge control if any passed  capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to implement any regional detention alternatives or to implement a modified no harm option which proposes specific capacity improvements to provide that a less stringent discharge control would not create any harm downstream article 925 33 92519 calculation methodology a stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated

low impact development practices alternative approach for managing stormwater runoff natural hydrologic conditions may be altered radically by poorly planned development practices such as introducing unneeded impervious surfaces destroying existing drainage swales constructing unnecessary storm sewers and changing local topography a traditional drainage approach of development has been to remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a detention basin this approach leads ultimately to the degradation of water quality as well as expenditure of additional resources for detaining and managing concentrated runoff at some downstream location the recommended alternative approach is to promote practices that will minimize postdevelopment runoff rates and volumes which will minimize needs for artificial conveyance and storage facilities to simulate predevelopment hydrologic conditions forced infiltration is often necessary to offset the loss of infiltration by creation of impervious surfaces the ability of the ground to infiltrate depends upon the soil types and its conditions preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful alternative site design considerations site design practices include preserving natural drainage features minimizing impervious surface area reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces and protecting natural depression storage a welldesigned site will contain a mix of all those features the following describes various techniques to achieve the alternative approach  preserving natural drainage features protecting natural drainage features particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels is desirable because of their ability to infiltrate and attenuate flows and to filter pollutants however this objective is often not accomplished in land development in fact commonly held drainage philosophy encourages just the opposite pattern  streets and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in the natural headwater valleys and swales thereby replacing natural drainage functions with a completely impervious system as a result runoff and pollutants generated from impervious surfaces flow directly into storm sewers with no opportunity for attenuation infiltration or filtration developments designed to fit site topography also minimizes the amount of grading on site  protecting natural depression storage areas depressional storage areas have no surface outlet or drain very slowly following a storm event they can be commonly seen as ponded areas in farm fields during the wet season or after large runoff events traditional development practices eliminate these depressions by filling or draining thereby obliterating their ability to reduce surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants the volume and releaserate characteristics of depressions should be protected in the design of the development site the depressions can be protected by simply avoiding the depression or by incorporating its storage as additional capacity in required detention article 925 76 facilities  avoiding introduction of impervious areas careful site planning should consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible building footprints sidewalks driveways and other features producing impervious surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff  reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces impervious surfaces are significantly less of a problem if they are not directly connected to an impervious conveyance system such as storm sewer two basic ways to reduce hydraulic connectivity are routing of roof runoff over lawns and reducing the use of storm sewers site grading should promote increasing travel time of stormwater runoff and should help reduce concentration of runoff to a single point in the development  routing roof runoff over lawns roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns in most site designs the practice discourages direct connections of downspouts to storm sewers or parking lots the practice also discourages sloping driveways and parking lots to the street by routing roof drains and crowning the driveway to run off to the lawn the lawn is essentially used as a filter strip  reducing the use of storm sewers by reducing use of storm sewers for draining streets parking lots and back yards the potential for accelerating runoff from the development can be greatly reduced the practice requires greater use of swales and may not be practical for some development sites especially if there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a reasonable time the practice requires educating local citizens and public works officials who expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event  reducing street widths street widths can be reduced by either eliminating onstreet parking or by reducing roadway widths municipal planners and traffic designers should encourage narrower neighborhood streets which ultimately could lower maintenance  limiting sidewalks to one side of the street a sidewalk on one side of the street may suffice in lowtraffic neighborhoods the lost sidewalk could be replaced with bicyclerecreational trails that follow backoflot lines where appropriate backyard trails should be constructed using pervious materials  using permeable paving materials these materials include permeable interlocking concrete paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete such materials should be considered as alternatives to conventional pavement surfaces especially for low use surfaces such as driveways overflow parking lots and emergency access roads  reducing building setbacks reducing building setbacks reduces driveway and entry walks and is most readily accomplished along lowtraffic streets where traffic noise is not a problem  constructing cluster developments cluster developments can also reduce the amount of impervious area for a given number of lots the biggest savings is in street length article 925 77 which also will reduce costs of the development cluster development clusters the construction activity onto lesssensitive areas without substantially affecting the gross density of development appendix g preliminary site investigation and testing requirments required data and site information the following data shall be gathered as part of a preliminary site investigation  bedrock composition  any apparent boundaries between carbonate and noncarbonate bedrock must be verified by a qualified geotechnical professional  bedrock structural geology  this includes the possible presence of faults and mapping of conspicuous fracture traces or lineaments  overburden and soil mantle composition and thickness  permeability of the soil  depth to the seasonal high water table  presence of special geologic features  this includes sinkholes closed depressions fracture traces lineaments and geologic contacts between carbonate and noncarbonate bedrock investigation required for all sites review of available data maps and reports some of the required information as listed above can be found in existing published data suggested resources include the following  geologic maps and references for the development area  the little lehigh creek basin carbonate prototype area closed depression map  available at the lvpc  usgs topographic maps  lehigh and northampton county soil survey maps  aerial photographs from the lvpc or other sources  relevant pennsylvania geologic survey open file reports that provide maps of sinkholes and karst

inventory   field inspections in addition to gathering data from published sources a field inspection of the proposed site is required a field inspection can provide additional information relating to site features such as carbonate bedrock features indicators of seasonal high streamlevel or water table levels streams springs etc soil test pit and percolation test requirements a minimum of one test pit and a minimum of 2 percolation tests are required for every site a test pit is a 23 foot wide 8 foot deep trench excavated with a backhoe for observing subsurface conditions the test pits will be used to describe soil depth and quality including soil horizons and testing of permeability or percolation rates and can be conducted by a certified sewage enforcement officer article 925 78 percolation tests are to be conducted as follows adapted from  7315 percolation tests of the pennsylvania  1 the percolation tests shall be made in separate holes uniformly spaced over the possible infiltration area 2 an initial presoak should not be performed 3 percolation holes located within the possible infiltration area shall be used in the calculation of the average percolation rate 4 holes having a uniform diameter of 6 to 10inches shall be bored or dug as follows a to the depth of the bottom of the possible infiltration bmp b alternate depths if the test pitsauger holes indicate that the soils are more suitable at a different depth ie if a clay horizon is identified and more suitable soils are located beneath the horizon and infiltration test should be performed in the suitable horizon 5 the bottom and sides of the hole shall be scarified with a knife blade or sharppointed instrument to completely remove any smeared soil surfaces and to provide a natural soil interface into which water may percolate loose material shall be removed from the hole two inches of coarse sand or fine gravel shall be placed in the bottom of the hole to protect the soil from scouring and clogging of the pores 6 immediately before the percolation test as a final presoak water shall be placed in the hole to a minimum depth of 6inches over the gravel and readjusted every 30 minutes for 1 hour 7 the drop in the water level during the last 30 minutes of the final presoaking period shall be applied to the following standard to determine the time interval between readings for each percolation hole a if water remains in the hole the interval for readings during the percolation test shall be 30 minutes b if no water remains in the hole the interval for readings during the percolation test may be reduced to 10 minutes 8 after the final presoaking period water in the hole shall again be adjusted to approximately 6inches over the gravel and readjusted when necessary after each reading a measurement to the water level in the individual percolation holes shall be made from a fixed reference point and shall continue at the interval determined from step no 7 above for each individual percolation hole until a minimum of eight reading are completed or until a stabilized rate of drop is obtained whichever occurs first a stabilized rate of drop article 925 79 means a difference of inch or less of drop between the highest and lowest readings of four consecutive readings b the drop that occurs in the final period in percolation test holes expressed as inches per hour shall be used to calculate the average percolation rate c when the rate of drop in a percolation test is too slow to obtain a measurable rate the rate of 025 inches per hour shall be assigned to that hole for use in calculating the average percolation rate the infiltration area may be placed over holes with no measurable rate when the average percolation rate for the possible infiltration area is within the acceptable range when a percolation test hole yields a percolation rate of greater than 12inches per hour the proposed infiltration area may not be designed or installed within 25feet of this hole unless the municipality determines that a testing anomaly caused the fast percolation rate and a retest of the area yields acceptable percolation rates this percolation rate limit is established to protect groundwater quality and to minimize the risk of subsidence additional site investigation and testing required if infiltration is proposed soil test pit requirements the required number of test pits varies with effective soil thickness as risk factors increase the number of test pits increases a minimum of 2 test pits uniformly spaced within the proposed infiltration area eg the 2 pits should be centered on each half of the proposed infiltration area are required for any site proposing infiltration unless the applicant can demonstrate that one test pit is adequately representative of the area proposed for infiltration for larger infiltration areas multiple test pits shall be developed at the densities as listed below effective soil thickness feet  test

findings have been made by the governing body of the city of bethlehem a inadequate management of accelerated runoff of storm water resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control storm water undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b a comprehensive program of storm water management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of the people of the city of bethlehem and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment 135002 purpose the purpose of these regulations is to promote the public health safety and welfare by minimizing the damages described in a of this provisions designed to a control accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at their source by regulating activities which cause such problems b utilize and preserve the desirable existing natural drainage systems c encourage recharge of groundwaters where appropriate d maintain the existing flows and quality of streams and water courses in the city of bethlehem and the commonwealth e preserve and restore the flood carrying capacity of streams f provide for proper maintenance of all permanent storm water management structures which are constructed in the city of bethlehem 135003 statutory authority 2 the city of bethlehem is empowered to regulate these activities by the authority of the act of october 4 l978 pl 864 act l67 the storm water management act and the optional third class city charter law act of july l5 l957 pl 90l 135004 applicability when they affect 10000 sqfeet  of land the following activities shall be subject to these regulations however if in the opinion of the city engineer compliance with these regulations is necessary to prevent the occurence or exacerbation of storm water or erosion control problems  than activities which cover less than 10000 sq feet  shall also be subject to these regulations a development b subdivision c earthmoving d agricultural operations e forest management operations f nursery operations g diversion or piping of any natural or manmade stream channel h installation of storm water system or appurtenances thereto 135005 general requirements a storm drainage systems  general l construct storm drainage systems as necessary to convey the flow of surface waters without damage to persons or property 2 construct completely the necessary storm sewer facilities as approved by the city engineer to drain the storm water runoff from the applicants land as well as the collected runoff from developments at higher elevations in the same watershed should the land at a higher elevation be undeveloped the design of the storm sewer system local to the applicant shall be designed as if the land above were fully developed assuming runoff controls in effect in a tributary area 3 3 construct completely capped storm sewers when in the opinion of the city engineer the combination of storm waters from the applicants tract and undeveloped land at a higher elevation would not necessitate use of the sewer line until the land above is developed 4storm drainage systems shall among other requirements a permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses except as modified by storm water detention facilities or open channels consistent with this ordinance  b provide positive drainage away from buildings and onsite sewage disposal systems  and c prevent

specifications and procedures acceptable to the city engineer b stormwater discharge to a deficient channel should it be evident that an offsite stormwater drainage channel into which a developer desires to discharge postdevelopment stormwater at a flow rate greater than the predevelopment stormwater flow rate is deficient either from a safety hydraulic or erosion control standpoint the developer shall  as determined by the city engineer and consistent with any applicable act 167 watershed plans  provide an appropriate detention facility or provide the city a monetary compensation according to the following formula or upgrade the deficient stormwater channel to the satisfacton of the city engineer 1 monetary compensation in dollars    x area of additional impervious surfaces in sqfeet  but not less than $100000 2 monetary compensation collected herein shall be placed into a special escrow account of the city for the sole purpose of providing to finance construction work

not be altered without written approval of the affected property owners and the city engineer 4 2areas of existing diffused drainage discharge onto adjacent property shall be managed such that the peak diffused flow does not increase in the general direction of discharge except as otherwise provided in this diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto adjacent property the developer must document that there are adequate downstream conveyance facilities to safely transport the concentrated discharge or otherwise prove that no harm will result from the concentrated discharge areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any applicable release rate criteria in the general direction of existing discharge whether they are proposed to be concentrated or maintained as diffused drainage areas d stormwater drainage easement where a subdivision is traversed by watercourses other than permanent streams or if acceptable to the city engineer in areas of sheet or shallow flow there shall be provided a drainage easement conforming substantially with the line of such watercourse the width of the easement shall be adequate to provide for unimpeded flow of storm runoff based on calculations made in conformance with the l00year return period runoff and to provide a freeboard allowance of onehalf 05 foot above the design water surface level the terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation the placing of fill structures plantings andor any other alterations or obstructions which may adversely affect the flow of storm water within any portion of the easement also periodic maintenance of the easement to ensure proper runoff conveyance shall be required e street drainage 1storm drainage systems shall among other requirements a

all points of discharge the engineering designs for controlling runoff both during and after construction shall comply with the der soil erosion and sedimentation control manualfebruary 1985 i stormwater volume control where geology permits consideration should be given to the design and use of volume controls for storm water management j stormwater detention 1 stormwater detention facilities shall be used whenever increased runoff from the land development would overload drainage systems or cause significant increases in flood levels in any watercourses downstream this will be determined by comparing the increase in runoff caused by the land development with the existing runoff rates and capacity of downstream drainage systems and watercourses any proposed land development within a watershed for which there is an approved act l67 stormwater management plan shall adhere to the detentionno detention requirements of the plan this ordinance incorporates the basic requirements of all apporved stormwater management plans under act l67  and therefore any proposed land development within a city watershed shall adhere to the detentionno detention requirements of the applicable watershed plan a watersheds under an approved act 167 stormwater management plan within watershed for which there is an approved act l67 stormwater management plan the detention facilities shall be designed to discharge postdevelopment peak runoff rates consistent with the plan criteria except in the instance of offsite detention facilities implemented in accordance with paragraph c below in the event that detention is not required by the act 167 plan the developer shall still be required to pay a fee equivalent to the cost of detention as stipulated in 05b b watersheds not under an approved act 167 stormwater management plan within watersheds for which there is not an approved act l67 stormwater management plan the detention facilities shall be designed to provide the peak rate of runoff at all points of discharge from the site when developed which will not exceed the peak rate of runoff at each of those points prior to development for a one 1 five 5 ten 10 twentyfive 25 fifty 50 and one hundred 100 year storm except in the instance of offsite detention facilities implemented in accordance with paragraph c below further the city engineer may impose more restrictive requirements on release rates when a valid engineering study indicates that more restrictive requirements are necessary to prevent an increase in the peak flow rates at any point downstream up to the confluence of the lehigh river from the point of discharge in cases where a proposed land development cannot accomodate a detention facility andor if  in the opinion of the city engineer  a detention facility is not feasible nor a significantly useful stormwater management tool the developer may at the discretion of the city engineer request to pay a fee equivalent to the cost of detention in lieu of detention as stipulated in b cregional detention facilities in certain instances regional detention facilities to provide runoff control for multiple development sites may be implemented in lieu of individual development site detention basins peak runoff rates of discharge from a regional detention basin shall be based upon maintaining existing peak runoff rates for the tributary area except that other criteria for discharge may apply for regional detention facilities located within a watershed with an approved act l67 stormwater management plan any developer relying upon regional detention facilities in lieu of onsite controls shall pay a fee to the owner of the regional facility in proportion to the share of total storage volume required by the development and provided by the basin any proposed regional detention facility shall have the approval of the joint planning commission as well as the city 8 engineer 2 provisions of detention facilities where detention facilities are included as part of the storm drainage system the following provisions will apply a detention ponds shall be designed so that they return to normal conditions within approximately twelve l2 hours after the termination of the storm unless the city engineer finds that downstream conditions may warrant other design criteria for stormwater release b the developer shall demonstrate that such ponds are designed protected and located to assure that public safety is maximized and health problems are prevented certain protective devices andor screenings such as fencing and landscaping may be required at the discretion of the city engineer andor planning commission as applicable the depth of the detention facility and the location of the facility in conjunction with the surrounding structuresshall be considered when considering the need for the above improvements c the developer shall verify that the operation of the detention facilities will not aggravate potential downstream peaking conditions unless the detention facilities have been designed in accordance with an approved act l67 stormwater management plan for the applicable watershed d

where a storm in excess of this storm will likely cause damage to existing or future structures or their contents 2 stormwater runoff from watersheds of twenty 20 or less acres may be calculated by the rational method as described in manual number 37 of the american society of civil engineers except as the watershed size criteria may be modified by an approved act l67 stormwater management plan

monocacy creek and nancy run storm water management plans the city is hereby divided into storm water management districts consistent with the monocacy creek and nancy run release rate maps presented in the plans the boundaries of the 12 storm water management districts are shown on an official map which is available for inspection at the city office a copy of the official map at a reduced scale is included in appendix a for general reference b description of storm water management districts  three types of storm water management district may be applicable to the municipality namely single release rate districts provisional no detention districts and dual release rate districts as described below l single release rate districts  there are six single release rate districts which differ in the extent to which postdevelopment runoff must be controlled the release rates and districts are 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% and l00% within a given district the postdevelopment peak rate of storm runoff must be controlled to the stated percentage of the predevelopment peak rate of storm runoff in order to protect downstream watershed areas 2 provisional no detention districts  these watershed areas may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff without detention facilities without adversely affecting the total watershed peak flow in certain instances however the local runoff conveyance facilities which transport runoff from the site to the main channel may not have adequate capacity to safely transport increased peak flows associated with not providing detention for a proposed development in those instances the developer shall either use a l00% release rate control or provide increased capacity of downstream drainage elements to convey increased peak flows consistent with h in determining if adequate capacity exists in the local watershed drainage network the developer must assume that the entire local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls specified by this any capacity improvement must be designed to convey runoff from development of all areas tributary to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria specified in c 3 dual release rate districts  the anticipated postdevelopment runoff from these areas can only be controlled across the range of return periods from 2 years by implementing a dual system of release rates this system is designated as 30%l00% release rate criteria within this 13 district the 2year postdevelopment runoff must be controlled to 30% of the predevelopment 2year runoff peak further the l0year 25year and l00year postdevelopment runoff must be controlled to l00% of the predevelopment peak storm water management district implementation provisions a any storm water management controls required by this subject to single release rate criteria 50% % shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for each of the 2 l0 25 and l00year return period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology specified in storm water management controls intended to meet the dual release rate 30%l00% criteria shall also be designed consistent with b the exact location of the storm water management district boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the twofoot topographic contours provided as part of the drainage plan the district boundaries as originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or in certain instances are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a potential flow obstruction eg road culvert bridge etc to the topographic divide consistent with topography c any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this use the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow rates l natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased runoff associated with a l0year return period event within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion acceptable velocities shall be based upon criteria included in the der soil erosion and sedimentation control manual february l985 and presented in appendix c of this natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased 25year return period runoff peak within their banks or otherwise not create any hazard to persons or property 14 3 culverts bridges storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must have sufficient capacity to pass or convey the increased flows associated with the 25year return period runoff event except for facilities located within a designated floodplain area which must be capable of passing or conveying the l00year return period runoff any facilities which constitute stream enclosures per ders regulations shall be designed to convey the l00year return period runoff d for a proposed development site located within only one release rate category area the total runoff from the site shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for development sites with multiple points of concentrated runoff discharge individual drainage points may be designed for up to a l00% release rate so long as the total runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate e for a proposed development site located within two or more release rate category areas the maximum peak rate of runoff that may be discharged at any point is limited to the predevelopment peak rate of runoff at the point multiplied by the applicable release rate the control rates shall apply regardless of any grading modifications which may change the drainage area which discharges at a given point f for proposed development sites located partially within a release rate category area and partially within a provisional no detention area in no event shall a significant portion of the site area subject to the release rate control be drained to the discharge points located in the no detention area g no harm option  for any proposed development site not located in a provisional no detention district the developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control including no detention if the developer can prove that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan proof of no harm would have to be shown from the development site remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the monocacy creek or the nancy run whichever is applicable with the lehigh river proof of no harm must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in c if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm justification 15 attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following provisions lthe peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the design return period storms 2 l0 25 and l00 year shall be the values from the calibrated penn state runoff model for the monocacy creek or nancy run watershed whichever is applicable these flow values would be supplied to the developer by the municipal engineer upon request 2 any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity ie if his site is l0% of the upstream undeveloped acreage he may use up to l0% of the documented downstream available capacity 3 developerproposed runoff controls which would generate increased peak flow rates at documented storm drainage problem areas would by definition be precluded from successful attempts to prove no harm except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with i any no harm justifications shall be submitted concurrently to the joint planning commission and the city engineer for review by the developer as part of the drainage plan submission per any extra submission costs resulting from the dual submission and review shall be borne by the developer the developer completely assumes all risks in so much that the submission of no harm requires a rigorous review for its approval  ie approval is not guaranteed h regional or subregional detention alternatives  for certain areas within the watershed it may be more costeffective to provide on control facility for an entire subarea group of subareas or portion of a subarea incorporating more than one development site than to provide an individual control facility for each development site the initiative and funding for any regional or subregional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers the design of any regional control basins must incorporate 16 reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed the peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a casebycase basis using the hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with protection of the downstream watershed areas hydrologic model refers to the calibrated monocacy creek version of the penn state runoff model as developed for the storm water management plan i capacity improvements  in certain instances primarily within the provisional no detention areas local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire watershed in these instances if the developer could prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network then the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff controls on the development site any capacity improvements would be designed based upon development of all areas tributary to the proposed improvement and the capacity criteria specified in c in addition all new development upstream of a proposed capacity improvement shall be assumed to implement the applicable runoff controls consistent with this that all new development within the entire subareas within which the proposed development site is located shall be assumed to implement the developers proposed discharge control if any capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to implement any regional or subregional detention alternatives or to implement a modified no harm option which proposes specific capacity improvements to document the validity of a less stringent discharge control which would not create any harm downstream j waiver of runoff control based on minimum additional impervious cover  any proposed regulated activity except those defined in i and l04j which would create l0000 square feet or less of additional impervious cover would be exempt from meeting the runoff control provisions of this developments which are to take place in stages the entire development plan must be used in determining conformance to this criteria additional impervious cover shall include but not

year method for reporting and paying the tax b a taxpayer by filing with the officer his written election to do so may make and file returns and pay tax on the same fiscal year basis used for federal tax purposes see e cash or accrual basis a a taxpayer may calculate income on the cash or accrual basis as those terms are used for federal income tax purposes the basis used by the taxpayer shall be the same as used by the taxpayer for the federal income tax b illustrations of computations of net profits  as amplification of the definition contained in a but not a limitation thereof the following information and requirements for the determination of net business profits are furnished 1 cash basis method  a taxpayer employing the cash basis of accounting includes in gross income all income subject to tax received during the year in cash or its equivalent he or she deducts all disbursements made during the year in cash or its equivalent provided deduction for such expenditures is authorized by law 2 the use of the cash basis is mandatory where no books or records of account are maintained 3 items of income and expenditure which as gross income and deduction are elements in computing taxable income need not necessarily be in the form of cash it is sufficient that such items if otherwise properly included in the computation can be valued in terms of money example a taxpayer on the cash basis received shares of stock in payment of services assuming that the stock has a fair market value the taxpayer has received the equivalent of cash to the extent of its value and that amount must be included as income 16 4 if a return is made on the cash basis gross profit shall include receipts from commissions fees and interest as well as the gross profit or loss from sales of merchandise chattels goods wares securities notes choosesinaction and services 5 accrual basis  if income is taken into consideration when earned even though not received in cash and expenses are considered as soon as incurred whether paid or not the system of accounting is said to be on the accrual basis these are the basic rules a the right to receive an item of income as distinguished from actual receipt determines its inclusion in gross income under the accrual basis  and b a deduction cannot be accrued until an actual liability is incurred example in september of last year a contractor performed work for a customer payment for this work was not received until this year if the taxpayer reports on the accrual basis the income will be included in last years return when earned if the taxpayer reports on the cash basis the payment will be included in this years return when received c a taxpayer engaged in more than one business activity may in computing taxable income use a different method for each trade or business activity d methods of accounting must clearly reflect income no method of accounting is allowed unless it clearly reflects income thus even if the taxpayers accounts are kept and the return made on the cash basis unusual cases way arise in which a payment made during the year is not deductible example commissions fees and costs paid in one year by a taxpayer in securing a loan for ten or fifteen years covered by a mortgage on property to be leased are not deductible in full in the year of payment but should be spread over the period of the loan even though the taxpayers accounts are kept and the return made on the cash basis penalty interest and late filing fee if for any reason the tax is not paid when due interest at the rate of six percent 06 per annum on the amount of said tax and an additional penalty of onehalf of one percent 005 of the amount of the unpaid tax for each month or fraction thereof during which the tax remains unpaid shall be added and collected where suit shall be brought for recovery of any such tax the person liable therefore shall in addition be liable for the cost of collection and the interest and penalty herein imposed if a taxpayer fails to file a valid annual return see  on or before the due date of the succeeding year or on or before the date to which an extension has been granted pursuant to the taxpayer shall at all times remain responsible for the filing of a valid annual return and shall be liable for a ten dollar $1000 late filing fee pursuant to this late filing fee shall be paid
