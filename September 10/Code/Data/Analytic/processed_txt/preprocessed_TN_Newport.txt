variations in concentrations or constituents of the users discharge monitoring facility operation maintenance sampling and testing performed by the general manager shall be at the users expense wastewater samples will be made available to the industry if requested the monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on the users premises outside of the building the general manager may however when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user allow the facility to be constructed in the public street rightofway with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction of that rightofway and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles if the monitoring facility is inside the users fence there shall be accommodations to allow safe and immediate access for the boards personnel whether constructed on public or private property the monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the

accepted into the system and specially treated subject to any payments or user charges as may be applicable the making of such special agreements or arrangements between the board and the user shall be strictly limited to the capability of the potw to handle such wastes without interfering with unfit operations or sludge use and handling or allowing the pass pollutants which would result in a

time however the general manager shall not accept an application that the applicant has submitted the same or substantially similar application within the preceding year and the same has been denied by the board all applications for an exception shall be in writing and shall contain sufficient information for evaluation of each of the factors to be considered by the board in its review of the application b conditions all exceptions granted under this subsection shall be temporary and subject to revocation at any time by the general manager upon reasonable notice the user requesting the exception must demonstrate to the general manager that the user is making a concentrated and serious effort to maintain his standards of operation control housekeeping levels etc so 1822 that discharges to the potw are being minimized if negligence is found permits will be subject to termination the user requesting the exception must demonstrate that compliance with stated concentration and quantity standards is technically or economically infeasible and the discharge if exempted will not i interfere with the normal collection and operation of the wastewater treatment system  ii limit the sludge management alternatives available and increase the chance of providing adequate sludge management iii pass potw in quantities andor concentrations that would cause the potw to violate its npdes permit the user must show that the exception if granted will cause the discharger to violate its inforce federal pretreatment standards unless exception is granted under the provisions of the applicable pretreatment regulations a surcharge shall be applied to any exception granted under this subsection these surcharges shall be applied for that concentration of pollutant for which the variance has been granted in excess of the concentration stipulated in this ordinance based on the average daily flow of the user at such time that the levels of pollutants must be reduced because of violations of any of the provisions in this section the following methods shall be used to reduce the discharge levels all users shall be required to reduce their discharge levels by a sufficient amount to meet the standards being violated users shall be required to reduce their discharge levels proportion to their contribution to the system c review of application by the general manager all applications for an exception shall be reviewed by the general manager if the application does not contain sufficient information for complete evaluation the general manager shall notify the applicant of the deficiencies and request additional information the applicant shall have thirty 30 days following notification by the general manager to correct such deficiencies this thirty 30 day period may

recommendations to the board at its next regularly scheduled meeting d review of application by the board the board shall review and evaluate all applications for exceptions and shall take into account the following factors i whether or not the applicant is subject to a national pretreatment standard containing discharge limitations more 1823 stringent than those in  18108 of this chapter and grant an exception only if such exception may be granted within limitations of applicable federal regulations ii whether or not the exception would apply to discharge of a substance classified as a toxic substance under regulations promulgated by the environmental protection agency under the provisions of section 307a of the act 33 usc 1317 and then grant an exception only if such exception may be granted with the limitations of applicable federal regulations  iii whether or not the granting of an exception would create conditions that would reduce the effectiveness of the treatment works taking into consideration the concentration of said pollutant in the treatment works influent and the design capability of the treatment works  iv the cost of pretreatment or other types of control techniques which would be necessary for the user to achieve effluent reduction but prohibitive and alone shall not be the basis for granting an exception  v the age of equipment and industrial facilities involved to the extent that such factors affect the quality or quantity of wastewater discharge  vi the process employed by the user and process changes available which would affect the quality or quantity of wastewater discharge  vii the engineering aspects of various types of pretreatment or other control techniques available to the user to improve the quality or quantity of

the user of liability for any expected loss or damage to the potw fish kills or any other damage to person or property  nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this ordinance or state or federal law c notice to employees in order that employees of users be informed of the boards requirements users shall make available

established by the board ii estimated billing if a meter fails to register properly or if a meter is removed to be tested or repaired or if water is received other than meter the board reserves the right to render an estimated bill based on the best information available the board also reserves the right to require metering of any water discharged into the sewer system iii supplemental water
