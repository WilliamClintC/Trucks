authorized to establish and operate wireless telecommunication services within a defined area it is the intent and purpose of this section to a facilitate adequate and sufficient provision of sites for nonessential wireless telecommunication facilities b establish predetermined locations for the placement of wireless telecommunication antenna arrays and when permitted the erection of support structures in accordance with the applicable requirements of this section c ensure that wireless telecommunication facilities are appropriately located so as to minimize any adverse impact they may have on other land use on the site or on surrounding properties d promote the public health safety and general welfare of the community e provide adequate information about plans for the location of

where such facilities are no longer in use or which have become unnecessary and g minimize the negative visual impact of wireless telecommunication facilities on residential areas office commercial and industrial sites public and quasipublic sites community landmarks including historic sites natural beauty areas and in public rightsofway 4 existing facilities achieving this end contemplates the establishment of as few tower type of support structures as reasonably feasible instead relying on the use of existing support structures buildings and other existing structures in the city or in adjoining communities that can meet the applicants service area needs 5 adverse impact the trenton city council believes that the presence of numerous wireless telecommunication support structures located throughout the city and particularly in residential neighborhoods would diminish the attractiveness of the community thereby destroying its character this in turn could have an adverse impact on property values therefore the city council believes it is necessary to minimize the adverse impact on the community that the presence of numerous relatively tall wireless telecommunication support structures with their characteristically low architectural and aesthetic appeal could have on the city while at the same time recognizing that the absence of any regulation would likely result in a material impediment to the maintenance and promotion of property values and further recognizing that this growing service is promoting economic gain and aiding in maintaining the health safety and general welfare of the city 6 location by order of priority a nonessential wireless telecommunications antenna array shall be permitted in one of the following locations by order of priority the first
