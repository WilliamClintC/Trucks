acceptable as an additional source by the town the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard b in the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the

in title 29 crs delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the town council does hereby adopt the floodplain management regulations set forth in this  findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the health safety and general welfare of the public b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to critical facilities infrastructure and other public facilities such as water sewer and gas mains  electric and communications stations  and streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is located in a flood hazard area  methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in

adultoriented businesses a legislative intent it is the intent and purpose of this regulate the time place and manner in which adult entertainment is presented in adultoriented businesses to promote the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the town and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of adult businesses within the town it is not the purpose of this prohibit adult entertainment or to curtail constitutionally protected freedom of expression b findings of fact the town council finds 1 regulation of adult businesses furthers substantial governmental interests and is necessary because in the absence of such regulation significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred this history of criminal activity has included prostitution narcotics and liquor law violations violent crimes against persons and property crimes 2 adult businesses are frequently used for unlawful and unhealthful sexual activities including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature 3 the concern over sexually transmitted diseases including aids is a legitimate health concern of the town which demands reasonable regulation of adult businesses in order to protect the health and wellbeing of the citizens 4 adult businesses have a deleterious effect on both neighboring businesses and surrounding residential areas causing an increase in crime and a decrease in property values 5 it is recognized that adult businesses have serious objectionable characteristics particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other thereby contributing to urban blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent area 6 the town council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of the citizens  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  deter the spread of urban blight and protect the citizens from increased crime 7 it is necessary to have a manager on the premises of adult businesses at all times as such establishments are offering adult entertainment so that there will be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the establishment including the actions of patrons entertainers and other employees 8 the license fees required hereinafter are necessary as nominal fees designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the town in regulating adult businesses 9 restricted hours of operation will further prevent the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses 10 locational criteria alone do not adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of the citizens and thus certain requirements with respect to the licensing and operation of adult businesses are in the public interest c definitions for the purposes of this the words and phrases used herein unless the context otherwise indicates shall have the

wetland and riparian protection regulations are enacted to protect the vital beneficial functions and values of wetlands and water areas within silverthorne this is to be accomplished by requiring that a permit be obtained for development activities in wetlands and water areas and associated buffer areas and that as a part of this permitting process the town will review disturbance permits and mitigation plans a critical element of this process is the determination of the buffer area boundary which will vary from a minimum twentyfive 25 feet and a maximum of one hundred twentyfive 125 feet depending upon the presence of sitespecific features and the use of best management practices it is intended that the buffer width will equal what is necessary to protect the wetlands and water areas from significant adverse impact arising from activities within the buffer and that applicants will be encouraged to reduce the width of the buffer best management practices it is anticipated that where an applicant includes best management practices the width of this buffer will be decreased below the maximum and that where these practices will fully mitigate the impact of development within the maximum buffer upon the wetlands or water area the buffer will be reduced to the minimum of twentyfive 25 feet  application the requirements of this division shall apply to all site development within a water area wetlands or buffer zone including site clearing grading excavation and the placement of material including without limitation any soil sand gravel mineral aggregate organic material or the storage of plowed snow a disturbance permit is required for any site development in wetland areas rivers streams ponds lakes or other water areas in the town or within the buffer zone associated with such wetland or water areas  enforcement in addition to other fines and penalties established herein for violations of this the town may seek an injunction requiring complete
