general welfare of the citizens of becker and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the harmful location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city of

similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this ordinance to condone or legitimatize the disbursement of obscene material b findings based on

beaumont texas  and also on findings found in the report of attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses june 16198 state of minnesota the council finds 1 sexually oriented business in the city of becker lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this ordinance as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incident of certain types of sexually oriented behavior at these businesses than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows as defined under this ordinance as adult book stores adult novelty shops adult video stores adult motion picture theaters or adult arcades 625 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which create

businesses 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 8 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of becker it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 9 requiring licenses of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 10 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this ordinance is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 11 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this ordinance 12 the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of
