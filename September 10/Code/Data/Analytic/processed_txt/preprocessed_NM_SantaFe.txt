bronchoconstriction and bronchospasm b nonsmokers who suffer ill effects from secondhand smoke may experience a drop in productivity and an increase in sick leave c the separation of people and tobacco smoke within the same air space may reduce but does not eliminate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke d the increasing popularity and use in public buildings of electronic smoking devices has led the united states food and drug administration fda to propose regulating electronic smoking devices as tobacco products a move supported by forty 40 state attorneys general including the new

recommendation to the governing body shall include a statement of the available parking space e downtown and eastside design standards the governing body recognizes that a style of architecture has evolved within the city from the year 1600 to the present characterized by construction with adobe  hereafter called old santa fe style and that another style has evolved hereafter called recent santa fe style which is a development from and an elaboration of the old santa fe style with different materials and frequently with added decorations 1 old santa fe style old santa fe style characterized by construction with adobe  is defined as including the socalled pueblo or pueblospanish or spanishindian and territorial styles and is more specifically described as follows a with rare exception buildings are of one story  few have three stories and the characteristic effect is that the buildings are long and low roofs are flat with a slight slope and surrounded on at least three sides by a firewall of the same color and material as the walls or of brick roofs are never carried out beyond the line of the walls except to cover an enclosed portal or porch formed by setting back a portion of the wall or to form an exterior portal  the outer edge of the roof being supported by wooden columns two story construction is more common in the territorial than in other substyles and is preferably accompanied by a balcony at the level of the floor of the second story  faades are flat varied by inset portales  exterior portales  projecting vigas or roof beams canales or waterspouts flanking buttresses and wooden lintels architraves and cornices which as well as doors are frequently carved and the carving may be picked out with bright colors arches are almost never used except for nonfunctional arches often slightly ogive over gateways in freestanding walls   b all exterior walls of a building are painted alike the colors range from a light earth color to a dark earth color the exception to this rule is the protected space under portales  or in churchderived designs inset panels in a wall under the roof in which case the roof overhangs the panel these spaces may be painted white or a contrasting color or have mural decorations  c solid wall space is always greater in any faade than window and door space combined single panes of glass larger than thirty 30 inches in any dimension are not permissible except as otherwise provided in this section  d the rule as to flat roofs shall not be construed to prevent the construction of skylights or installation of air conditioning devices or any other necessary roof structures  but such structures other than chimneys flues vents and aerials shall be so placed as to be concealed by the firewall from the view of anyone standing in the street on which the building fronts  e true old santa fe style buildings are made of adobe with mud plaster finish construction with masonry blocks bricks or other materials with which the adobe effect can be simulated is permissible  provided that the exterior walls are not less than eight 8 inches thick and that geometrically straight faade lines are avoided mud plaster or hard plaster simulating adobe  laid on smoothly is required  and f it is characteristic of old santa fe style commercial buildings to place a portal so that it covers the entire sidewalk the columns being set at the curb line 2 recent santa fe style recent santa fe style intends to achieve harmony with historic buildings by retention of a similarity of materials color proportion and general detail the dominating effect is to be that of adobe construction prescribed as follows a no building shall be over two stories in height in any faade unless the faade shall include projecting or recessed portales  setbacks or other design elements  b the combined door and window area in any publicly visible faade shall not exceed forty percent of the total area of the faade except for doors or windows located under a portal  no door or window in a publicly visible faade shall be located nearer than three 3 feet from the corner of the faade  c no cantilevers shall be permitted except over projecting vigas beams or wood corbels or as part of the roof treatment described below  d no less than eighty percent of the surface area of any publicly visible faade shall be adobe finish or stucco simulating adobe finish the balance of the publicly visible faade except as above may be of natural stone wood brick tile terra cotta or other material subject to approval as hereinafter provided for building permits   e the publicly visible faade of any building and of any adjoining walls shall except as otherwise provided be of one color which color shall simulate a light earth or dark earth color matte or dull finish and of relatively smooth texture faade surfaces under portales may be of contrasting or complimentary colors windows doors and portals on publicly visible portions of the building and walls shall be of one of the old santa fe styles  except that buildings with portals may have larger plate glass areas for windows under portals only deep window recesses are characteristic  and f flat roofs shall have not more than thirty 30 inches overhang f historic review district 1 applicability a the division shall review and approve or deny all

aesthetic beauty and natural environment is essential to protect the general welfare of the people of the city  to promote tourism and the economic welfare of the city  and to protect the cultural and historic setting of the city   b development is highly visible on or about the ridgetop areas of the foothills for great distances and detracts from the overall beauty of the natural environment and adversely impacts the aesthetics of the mountain and foothill vistas as seen from the city   c land within the escarpment overlay district is environmentally sensitive due to the presence of steep slopes  erosion problems drainage problems and other environmental attributes  d the interest and welfare of the people of the city is to prohibit development on ridgetop areas of the foothills to the extent possible as allowed by law  and e the interest and welfare of the people of the city is to restrict development in the escarpment overlay district to preserve the aesthetic beauty and natural environment of the ridgetop areas of the foothills and to protect the mountain views and scenic vistas from the city to the extent possible b district boundaries  1 the boundaries of the escarpment

regulations related to the design of public sanitary sewer systems for general development service it does not cover the criteria necessary for design or major interceptor sewers or treatment facilities the material is directed to the competent design professional and is not intended to be a detailed design handbook criteria and standards presented are those determined to be the minimum acceptable values necessary to result in system designs having satisfactory functional characteristics durability and operational suitability it is expected that the designer will strive for the best design to suit the circumstances involved and that designs will reflect sound professional judgment at all times governing regulations ordinances and policies related to the design and operation of sanitary sewer systems include the following a land development ordinances sfcc 1987 this ordinance primarily requires that sewer service be available to proposed developments before issuance of building permits there are no specific design criteria included in this chapter b sewer regulations sfcc 1987 this chapter contains uniform requirements for the users of the city of santa fe

of plat  a purpose the purpose of this subsection is to provide for the vacation or partial vacation of plats when vacation and reversion of such affected land is based on proper dedication of the subject property to the city of santa fe for public purposes there are reversionary rights in the grantors and it is deemed in the public interest to do so it is intended by this subsection that important factors to be considered in vacation or partial vacation of a plat shall first be whether the public rightofway continues to be a necessary part of the citys utility easements which should not be disturbed whether the public rightofway is a necessary and integral part of the citys traffic and neighborhood scheme for travel balanced against other interests such as whether the public rightofway is no longer needed or used as a public rightofway or has become a public nuisance and no other reasonable remedy is available to abate the nuisance it shall also be a considered factor whether at least seventyfive percent 75% of the grantors or their successors in interest approve of the vacation when the city believes it is in the citys best interests to vacate or partially vacate the plat in no circumstance shall any property be landlocked as a result or interpretation of this subsection b definitions 1 owners of the land means all of the owners of adjacent properties to the affected rightofway unless the governing body determines that there is good cause relating to the public welfare to vacate or partially vacate the plat with at least seventyfive percent 75% of the owners complying with paragraph c1a herein below a calculation of seventyfive percent 75% of a total of owners of the affected adjacent rightofway shall be rounded to the nearest whole number 2 plat means the map chart survey plan or replat certified by a licensed or registered surveyor which contains a description of subdivided land with ties to permanent monuments in regard to vacation or partial vacation of a plat relating to a public rightofway a plat may not be vacated in whole or in part unless the grantors dedicated the subject land for the rightofway with reversionary rights to the grantors evidence of such reversionary rights must be clearly shown on the certified plat or in any deed of conveyance or incorporated in a properly adopted ordinance 3 public nuisance means any activity function status or the result of such activity function or status whether participated in by one 1 person or several whether caused by machines persons or other devices which affects the health safety and welfare of an individual a neighborhood or community and degrades the quality of life for such individual neighborhood or community 4 vacation of plat means properly effected reversion of dedicated property to the grantors or their successors in interest and recording in the county real property records that the plat is vacated ie that it is set aside and including a reference to the vacation statement recording c vacation of plat 1 any plat filed in the office of the county clerk may be vacated or a portion of the plat may be vacated provided a the owners of the land in the territory proposed to be vacated sign a statement duly acknowledged declaring the plat or a portion of the plat to be vacated  and b the statement is endorsed approved by the planning authority of the municipality within whose platting jurisdiction the subdivision lies c the public works committee review each request for a vacation of plat or partial vacation of plat and make its recommendation for approval or denial of the request at a public hearing before the request proceeds to the planning commission for its review 2 in approving the vacation or partial vacation of a plat the planning authority of the municipality shall consider if the vacation or partial vacation of a plat will adversely affect the interests or rights of persons in contiguous territory or within the subdivision being vacated in approving the vacation or partial vacation of a plat the planning authority of the municipality may require that streets dedicated to the municipality in the original plat shall continue to be dedicated to the municipality the owners of lots on the vacated plat or on the portion of the plat being vacated may enclose in equal proportions the adjoining streets and alleys which are authorized to be abandoned by the planning authority of the municipality 3 the statement declaring the vacation or partial vacation of a plat and having the proper endorsements shall be filed in the office of the county clerk wherein the original plat is filed the county clerk shall mark the applicable words vacated or partially vacated across the plat and shall refer on the plat to

a range of housing opportunities throughout the city  and b new residential development has not provided sufficient housing opportunities for households with incomes below the area median income  and c the amount of land in the city available for new residential development is severely limited by geography and topography  and d inclusionary housing programs represent an extension of cities police powers to regulate land use ensuring that the limited supply of developable land provides housing opportunities for all incomes  and e santa fe is facing a growing shortage of housing that is affordable to a wide range of our population affecting the ability of new graduates senior citizens families with children and employees in industries and services that are vital to a healthy economy to remain living in the city  and f the lack of affordable housing is detrimental to the health safety and welfare of the citys residents  and g federal and state funds for the construction of new affordable housing are insufficient to fully address the problems of affordable housing within the city and the private housing market has not provided adequate affordable housing opportunities for persons and households with incomes below the area median income  and h the city has previously adopted the housing opportunity program in an attempt to address the affordable housing needs this program has achieved limited effectiveness in stemming the growing affordable housing crisis in the city  and i the governing body in partnership with the regional planning authority established an affordable housing task force that was charged with recommending appropriate affordable housing policy and programs for the region the task force recommendations included the implementation of a broadly applicable program to increase the supply of affordable housing particularly for those households with incomes less than the area median income  and j based on the findings of the task force the governing body finds that it is necessary to adopt a new inclusionary zoning ordinance to replace the housing opportunity program in order to address the citys housing crisis  and k according to the housing needs assessment updated in 201 the greatest mismatch between need and available services and affordable housing inventory is for renter households earning less than thirty percent 30% of the area median income ami with as many as three thousand 3000 renter households in santa fe likely to be cost burdened or paying more than onethird  of their incomes toward rents  and l the 2010 census indicates that 1 santa fes population is aging with fifty percent 50% of the overall population aged fiftyfive 55 years or older  2 households are smaller with single person households comprising forty percent 40% of overall households  and 3 the median age is fortyfour 44 years old compared to forty 40 years old in 2000 all factors that indicate housing demand is likely to shift to smaller units that can accommodate the needs of aging households and are located close to transit services and amenities  and m home sales prices continue to rise and were sixtyfive percent 65% higher in 2010 than in 200 increasing the gap between what buyers can afford and how much homes are priced with only fourteen percent 14% of current renters able to afford the medianpriced home necessitating the continued implementation of the citys inclusionary zoning and other affordable housing programs that improve the capacity of lower and moderateincome santa fe residents to buy homes  and n the

2811  short title this section may be cited as the living wage  #200213  1 2812  legislative findings the governing body of the city has determined that a the public welfare health safety and prosperity of santa fe require wages and benefits sufficient to ensure a decent and healthy life for workers and their families  b many santa fe workers earn wages insufficient to support themselves and their families  c many santa fe workers cannot participate in civic life or pursue educational cultural and recreational opportunities because they must work such long hours to meet their households most basic needs  d minimum wage laws promote the general welfare health safety and prosperity of santa fe by ensuring that workers can better support and care for their families own efforts and without financial governmental assistance  e the average earnings per job in santa fe county is twentythree percent 23% below the national average and the cost of living is eighteen percent 18% higher than the national average  f housing costs in santa fe are much higher than in most other parts of new mexico and low income workers must therefore spend a disproportionate percentage of their income sheltering themselves and their families  g livable wages also benefit employers and the economy as a whole by improving employee performance reducing employee turnover lowering absenteeism and thereby improving productivity and the quality of the services provided by employees  h when businesses do not pay a livable wage the community bears the cost in the form of increased demand for taxpayerfunded social services including homeless shelters soup kitchens and healthcare for the uninsured coupled with high real estate values low wages reduce the ability of low and moderateincome residents to access affordable housing as a result the city has had to invest significant tax dollars to support affordable housing including funding to nonprofit organizations purchasing land building infrastructure and waiving fees in addition the city has allocated significant tax dollars to operate after school and summer recreation programs and to support nonprofit organizations offering an array of human services and children and youth services all of which are needed by very lowincome residents and their families  i it is in the public interest to require certain employers benefiting from city actions and funding and from the opportunity to do business in the city to pay employees a minimum wage a living wage adequate to meet the basic needs of living in santa fe  j according to the 2000 census approximately twelve and threetenths percent 123% of the santa fe community lives below the poverty level  and k according to the new mexico department of labor twentythree and onehalf percent 235% of santa feans who are employed in the nongovernmental sector earn hourly wages of ten dollars and fifty cents $1050 per hour or less l the governing body has reviewed the impact of previous minimum wage increases relevant studies and other appropriate data and finds that the citys minimum wage should be upwardly adjusted each year to keep pace with increases in the cost of living m the governing body has found that limiting coverage of the minimum wage just to businesses with twentyfive 25 or more employees has hindered compliance and has created an uneven playing field among local businesses #200213  2  #20038  1  #200743  1 2813  authority of the city of santa fe this living wage adopted pursuant to the general welfare and police
