chapter or the elevation standards of the florida building   b determination by the board of appeals that 1 the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief 2 failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable  increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship exceptional hardship means the hardship associated with the land that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance the community requires that the variance is exceptional unusual and peculiar to the property involved mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional inconvenience aesthetic considerations physical handicaps personal preferences or the disapproval of ones neighbors likewise cannot as a rule qualify as an exceptional hardship all of these problems can be resolved means without granting a variance even if the alternative is more expensive or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance if granted shall be placed upon an instrument that will be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land  and d if the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a building or substantial improvement of a building below the required elevation receipt and submission of a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced flood elevation up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property comp

necessitate extensive facilities improvements and make it necessary to regulate new development in order to maintain water and sanitary sewer facilities at an acceptable level of service so as to maintain quality of life in the utility service area in order to finance the necessary new capital improvements and to purchase necessary equipment several combined financing methods will be necessary one of which will require new development to pay a system development charge which does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of new water and sanitary sewer facilities b providing water and sanitary sewer service in the citys urban service area is a recognized proprietary power of the city s   and is in the best interests of the publics health safety and welfare c implementing a regulatory scheme that requires new development to pay a water and sanitary sewer capital development charge that does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of new water and sanitary sewer facilities created by the new land development activity is the responsibility of the city in order to carry out the comprehensive plan as amended and is in the best interest of the publics health safety and welfare d the purpose of this article is to continue to enable the city to allow new development in compliance with the adopted comprehensive plan and to regulate new development activity generating water and sanitary sewer demand so as to require it to share in the burdens of growth by paying its pro rata share for the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of water and sanitary sewer facilities improvements thus new growth will help pay for itself and the existing water and sanitary sewer customers of the city will not have the full financial burden of providing increased water and sanitary sewer capacity at the outset e it is the purpose of this article to establish a system to assist in providing increased capacity for the water and sanitary sewer operations to accommodate the increased demand new development will have on the existing operations and to recover costs associated with the extension and connection to the utility system new land development activity within the citys urban service area will be required to pay a fee which does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated

the ecology and the public health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city 2 coastal areas form the first line of defense for the mainland against both winter storms and hurricanes in that the sand dunes of coastal areas perform protective functions for public and private property but placement of permanent structures in these protective areas may lead to increased risks to life and property and increased costs to the public coastal areas often protect lagoons salt marshes estuaries bays marine habitats and the mainland from the direct action of ocean waves and storm surges  absorb the forces of oceanic activity  protect calmer waters and stable shores  and are dynamic geologic systems with topography that is subject to alteration by waves storm surges flooding or littoral currents 3 coastal areas are one of the citys most valuable resources and have extremely high recreational and aesthetic value which should be preserved and enhanced coastal areas provide a unique habitat for birds wildlife marine life and plant life and protect waters that are vital to this ecosystem 4 it is anticipated that there will be a tremendous cost to the city and state for postdisaster redevelopment in the coastal areas but the costs can be reduced by preventive measures which should be taken on a continuing basis in order to reduce the harmful and costly consequences of natural and manmade disasters or emergencies c purpose the purpose of this section is to provide minimum standards for the design and construction of buildings and structures to reduce the harmful effects of hurricanes and other natural disasters occurring along the coastal areas of the city which fronts on the gulf of mexico these standards are intended to specifically address design features

are also present in these areas and are referenced in section 58873 b identification tidal swamp and marsh areas include all areas where brackish water or saltwater is contained at or above the soil surface for a sufficient period during the yearly water cycle often resulting in the establishment of natural communities of salttolerant vegetation that are characteristic of wetland areas within the city the predominant vegetation is 1 or more species of mangrove tree c location the general locations of tidal swamps and marshes have been identified in the rookery bay land use studies and the master plans for water management districts 6 and 7 they occur in isolation and in association with natural and humanmade waterways from clam bay south to dollar bay often as a narrow fringe of vegetation d suitability for development serious disturbances occur when the natural pattern of water movement system is altered structures or excavations which alter water flow could create serious

estuarine wetlands they function as aquifer recharge areas and provide a barrier to saltwater intrusion b identification freshwater swamps and marshes are areas with water contained at or above the soil surface for sufficient time throughout the year to result in the establishment of natural communities of wetland plants as listed in fac 62 c location the general locations of freshwater wetlands in the city area have been identified in the master plans for water management districts 6 and 7 and in the rookery bay land use studies few undisturbed freshwater wetlands still remain within the city several marshes exist on key island and along the gordon river but the majority of this habitat lies further east in the county d suitability for development freshwater swamps and marshes are

beaches and dunes a description gulf beaches and dunes include oceanfronting beaches extending landward of the mean highwater line mhwl and may include 1 or more low dune ridges these areas are subject to flooding from tidal or storm surges with superimposed velocity waves which make them unsuitable for residential development b identification the landward extent of the beach and dune system which must be protected lies between the shoreline and the coastal construction control line as identified and established pursuant to fs ch 161 and by relevant city ordinances a sitespecific survey is necessary to establish the exact position of both city setback lines which are defined as being 150 feet landward of the mean highwater line and 75 feet landward of the vegetation line and the position of the coastal construction control line c location the gulf beach and dune system within the city is approximately 8 miles in length and is the western land boundary of the city limits the coastal construction control line is surveyed and referenced to fixed monuments which are placed at approximately 1000foot intervals for the length of the shoreline the fema v zone is plotted on the official flood insurance rate maps of fema d suitability for development development within the beach and dune system is extremely hazardous due to storm surges wind and the dynamics of natural beach erosion cycles the destruction of native dune strand vegetation and dune areas increases erosion potential and reduces storm buffer capabilities the most serious erosion problems along the naples beach have occurred in the areas where shore protection structures primarily seawalls were installed on or in front of the dune system no armoring of the beach and dune system will be permitted in the cbra area in the remainder of the conservation zoning district existing armoring can be maintained and new armoring may be permitted subject to both city and state department of environmental protection variance and permitting requirements e permitted uses permitted uses are as follows see submittal requirements 1 passive recreation activities which do not require a permanent structure and

clarification 3 marinas in compliance with the citys marina siting criteria a development of significant environmental impact assessment is required as well as a petition for a conditional use 4 dredging activities comp dev n     11181998 transitional conservation district a purpose the transitional conservation district shall function in part as a buffer area to ensure compatible development adjacent to the conservation zoning district there would be little practical benefit to establish strict controls over development in the conservation zoning district while permitting indiscriminate development to occur on its boundaries tc district areas require special precautions and attention prior to development because of their resource value potential hazards that may exist and their proximity and relationship to conservation zoning district areas failure to consider these limitations may result in direct or indirect consequences harmful to the public health safety and welfare b district structure see section 58862 c district subcategories the transitional conservation district includes transitional land class iii waters and passive park recreation and major open space areas this district also includes highhazard areas that are unplatted noncbra areas seaward of the coastal construction control line not including wetlands which was adopted in june 198 or any adopted change which would locate the line farther landward d land use and zoning designation 1 land use designation the land use designation for the tc district is conservationlimited development 2 zoning designation because of their critical environmental concern these lands are zoned c conservation which is the designation for vital lands within such areas there may be smaller parcels which are suitable for limited development zoning  however these areas cannot be clearly separated from vital lands without an environmental assessment e general definitions reference section 58865 comp dev o   transitional land a description because of such conditions as low elevation poor drainage or other physical restrictions transitional lands are only marginally developable and require a major alteration in order to be made suitable for urban development for these reasons only recreational facilities and very low residential density uses may be reasonable developments these areas are identified as marginal land by the comprehensive plan adopted in january 1989 b identification transitional lands are undeveloped or relatively unimproved dry lands which are characterized by 1 or more of the following conditions 1 they are below 5 feet elevation above mean sea level msl or navd 88 and are not vital lands according to an environmental assessment  2 they are lands contiguous to a conservation zoning district area  or 3 they are lands without existing or easily provided access from developed areas transitional lands are defined by their elevation location or accessibility topographic maps soil surveys field surveys and local state and federal permitting and review procedures may be used to identify these areas c location transitional lands are found on key island the east shore of naples bay and both sides of the gordon river d suitability for development 1 portions of the east shore of naples bay and all of key island are not accessible by existing improved roads this lack of accessibility requires special consideration for providing city services such as emergency services garbage collection and utility services potential disturbance related to accessibility or services should be minimized by limiting clearing as defined by the district provisions and grouping utilities and other service areas 2 the physical characteristics of transitional lands are generally more tolerant relative to alteration than are conservation zoning district vital areas however there is a significant hazard of relatively frequent flooding as a result of unusually high tides or storms 3 due to the fact that virtually all of the transitional lands are contiguous to conservation zoning district areas any development must not threaten the integrity diminish the benefits or interfere with the functions of the designated conservation zoning district areas e permitted uses permitted uses are as follows see submittal requirements 1 natural water quality maintenance  2 natural wildlife habitat  and 3 open space area f conditional uses conditional uses are as follows see submittal requirements 1 passive low intensity recreation such as hiking footpaths
