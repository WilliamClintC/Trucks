regulations 201201 general 201202 application 201203 administration 201204 provisions for flood hazard reduction 201205 definitions 201201 general a findings of fact 1 the areas of special flood hazard of lawrence kansas are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by i the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  ii urbanization of upstream areas resulting in increased impervious surface and increased stormwater runoff  iii the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages  and iv the modification of the floodplain by grading or filling 3 the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of the national flood insurance program uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps i selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors at its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent 1% chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated in the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto  ii calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood  floodplain management regulations   2 effective  land development  iii computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point  iv delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height  and v delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood b floodplain overlay district  property within

elevations and floodplain widths identified by the fis and flood insurance rate map firm for douglas county kansas and incorporated areas dated  may increase over time as a result of additional watershed development  therefore the city has identified the floodplain fp overlay district for property annexed into the citys corporate limits after  as the area that includes i all zones a on the current firm  ii all zones ae and ah on the current firm and all adjacent areas inundated by a flood having an elevation of the fis base flood elevation plus an additional two feet of freeboard if an

current firm and all adjacent areas inundated by a flood having an elevation of the fis average depth of flooding plus an additional two feet of freeboard if an approved hydrologic and hydraulic study has been completed the boundary information provided in that study will be utilized to amend the floodplain overlay district boundaries  and iv all stream tributaries having a drainage area of 240 acres or more regardless of the limits of the fis upstream of the limits of the fis the width of the floodplain overlay district shall be determined by the city using recognized engineering practices

floodways are located within the floodplain overlay district established in e as designated on the firm since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles the city hereby adopts a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area identified for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one 1 foot at any point 1 the regulatory floodway includes i floodway areas shown within zone ae on the current firm
