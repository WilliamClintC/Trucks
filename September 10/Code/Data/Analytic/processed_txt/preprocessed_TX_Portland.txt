the receiving waters without being affected by normal sewage treatment processes  or d can have deleterious effects on the treatment process due to excessive quantities 2 any radioactive wastes greater than the allowable releases as specified by current united states bureau of standards handbooks dealing with the handling and release of radioactivity 3 cyanides or cyanogen compounds capable of liberating hydrocyanic gas on acidification in excess of onehalf 05 part per million by weight as cn in the wastes from any outlet into the public sewers 4 materials which exert or cause a unusual

desiring to deposit or discharge any industrial waste mixture into the sewers or sewer works of the city or any sewer connected therewith or who is now so doing shall make application to the approving

discharge an industrial waste mixture into the sewers or sewer works of the city or any sewer connected therewith shall provide and maintain in a suitable accessible position on his premises or such premises occupied by him an inspection chamber or manhole near the outlet of each sewer drain pipe channel or connection which communicates with any sewer or sewer works of the city or any sewer connected therewith each such manhole or inspection chamber shall be of such design and construction which will prevent infiltration by ground and surface waters or introduction of slugs or solids by installation of screens with maximum openings of one 1 inch but of such sufficient fineness to prevent the entrance of objectionable slugs or solids to the sanitary sewage system and shall be so maintained by persons discharging wastes so that any authorized representative or employee of the city may readily and safely measure the volume and obtain samples of the flow at all times plans for the construction of control manholes or inspection chambers including such flow measuring devices as may or may not be required shall be approved by the approving authority prior to the beginning of construction c measurement of flow the water consumption during the previous month as determined from the meter records of the water department shall be the valid basis for computing the sewage flow unless actual sewage flow is measured by a recording meter of a type approved by the approving authority the persons shall install and maintain such device in proper condition to accurately measure such flow upon failure to do so the water consumption shall be the basis for charges when water is contained in a product or is evaporated or is discharged as unpolluted waste in an uncontaminated condition to surface drainage an application may be made for a reduction in the volume of waste discharged to the public sewer provided supporting data satisfactory to the approving authority is furnished this data shall include a flow diagram destination of water supply andor waste supported by submetering data installed on such process piping at the expense of the person d sampling of

samples shall be taken at such intervals as determined by the approving authority as necessary to maintain a control over the discharges from the establishment the method used in the examination of all bacteriological wastes to determine suspended solids bod and prohibited wastes shall be those set forth in section 23171  6171 protection from damage a no unauthorized person shall maliciously

into the system is based on the current rate schedule provided that the city meter is the only source of water used by the owner and provided that the bod or the suspended solids in the waste water does not exceed the normal concentration of three hundred 300 parts per million in those cases where the owner uses water other than city water then said owner shall be required to install at his own expense a city water meter to measure the volume of water used the sewage service charge will be computed by the city manager using the basic city sewerage service rates b when the total concentration of the bod and the suspended solids added together exceed six hundred 600 parts per million at the point entering the citys system a surcharge shall be applied to the base sewage service the surcharge shall be based on dividing the sum of the actual bod and suspended solids by six hundred 600 to get the factor that the discharging waste exceeds the normal concentration the city manager shall use this factor in addition to the actual volume of discharged waste to determine the surcharge which is additive to the basic sewage service charge c the determination of bod and suspended solids shall be by an independent laboratory selected by the city d samples shall be taken in accordance with the provisions covered under section 23174d of this article e when any such tests made at the discretion of the city shows that a surcharge shall be applied continued or increased over the base rate whichever is applicable then the owner shall pay the actual cost for each test which shall include sampling mailing and handling and the laboratory fees when a surcharge is in effect a test will be made at least once each thirty 30 days when such tests made at the discretion of the city reveals that the surcharge is no longer applicable then no costs will be made to the owner for such test or tests  6171 billing a industrial waste surcharges provided for in this article shall be

maintenance or reuse of older urban or historic buildings 3 equity a variance may be granted to permit modifications of height or setback regulations as may be needed to secure equity in the

use plan or policy 2 the variance would be a material detriment to the public welfare or create injury to the use enjoyment or value of property in the vicinity 3 the variance is not the minimum variance that will relieve the proven hardship 4 the variance would allow a use not allowed in the use table for the district in which the parcel is located 5 the variance will relieve the applicant

following criteria are met 1 special circumstances exist that are peculiar to the land or structure that are not applicable to other land or structures in the same zoning district and are not merely financial 2 these special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant 3 literal interpretation and enforcement of the terms and provisions of this deprive the applicant of rights
