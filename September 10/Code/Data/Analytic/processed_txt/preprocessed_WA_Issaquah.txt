purpose of the impervious surface standard is to provide a balance of impervious and pervious surfaces on a lot ensuring that adequate drainage is achieved and potential runoff of the lot is controlled some impervious surfaces like recreational areas provide visual relief from the built environment and create usable open space and linked areas which are an integrated part of the project pervious surfaces provide scenic corridors and visual relief from the built environment and provide protection for water quality and the natural environment where possible pervious surfaces should be consolidated or linked so that these areas can also function as usable open space impervious surface standards are defined assuming no site constraints  in actuality there may be site constraints that prevent the permitted impervious surface to be used buse of pervious areas all required pervious areas on the site per imc  district standards table shall be landscaped as required in this chapter parking or pedestrian access areas that use pervious pavers or pervious stormwater measures shall not be counted towards the required pervious areas of the land use district  however stormwater

notice from the public the city will evaluate the condition of potentially hazardous trees located on city property and take appropriate actions 4preventive measure evaluation an evaluation of preventive measures by an arborist in lieu of removing the tree and potential impacts of tree removal may be required if required this evaluation shall include the following measures aavoid disturbing tree avoid disturbing the tree at all unless it represents a hazard as determined by an arborist  bstabilize tree stabilize the tree if possible using approved arboricultural methods such as cable and bracing in conjunction with other practices to rejuvenate the tree such as repairing damaged bark and trunk wounds mulching application of fertilizer and improving aeration of the tree root zones  cpruning remove limbs from the tree such as removing dead or broken branches or by reducing branch end weights if needed remove up to onequarter 14 of the branches from the canopy and main trunk only in small amounts unless greater pruning is needed by approval of the arborist  dwildlife tree create a wildlife tree or snag or cut the tree down to a safe condition without disturbing the roots where the tree no longer poses a hazard to create snags remove all branches from the canopy girdle deciduous trees and leave the main trunk standing wildlife trees or snags are most appropriate in greenbelts npges vacant property and environmentally critical areas  esteep slopes removal of tree roots on steep slopes may require a geotechnical evaluation  fcreeks and lakes trees fallen into

pedestrians are priority requiring buildings and open space that are openly interrelated designing sites that make a positive contribution to the public realm attracting and retaining businesses that complement each urban villages vision and ultimately creating a place where people of all income levels and diversities are drawn to live work and play these standards promote the construction of developments that will have an appealing and visually engaging public realm in order to encourage social interaction outdoor activity and a pedestrian orientation in a sustainable compact mixed use area more specifically for each urban village the replacement regulations for issaquah highlands are committed to retaining a distinct neighborhood in issaquah that possesses a strong sense of community is progressive in its design and will be a place where people live work and play in a pedestrianfriendly environment surrounded and enhanced by acres of preserved open space this idea incorporates and updates the amenities prevalent in a nineteenth or early twentieth century town with the intent of reviving the closeknit spirit of traditional villages and communities including narrow streets in a comprehensible layout  a comfortable sense of community  an eclectic mix of housing  a plan that encourages walking  a mixed use village area  buildings on small lots that

have an appealing and visually engaging public realm in order to encourage social interaction outdoor activity and a pedestrian orientation in a sustainable compact mixed use area more specifically for talus the replacement regulations for talus are as an urban village committed to retaining a distinct neighborhood with a mountain village character it also recognizes the importance of both quality of design in the built environment and sensitivity to the natural environment in terms of the built environment good design must mean not only a visually pleasing community but one that embraces architectural diversity and provides a variety of opportunities for social interaction among residents employees and visitors the talus vision embraces clustered development and large areas of open space connected by an extensive pedestrian and vehicular circulation system  housing for many lifestyles age groups and incomes  a limited number of opportunities for working and shopping in a pedestrian friendly setting appropriate site planning will provide connectivity between uses proximity of uses to each other and siting of structures and landscape elements to reinforce the street these elements work together to create a public realm that encourages social interaction between community members as developed talus has a mountain village character which though described as urban

flexibility when a multipurpose trail moves critical area they provide pedestrian and bicycle movement areas with minimal disturbance cneighborhood trail neighborhood trails are hard or soft surface trails designed to provide recreational opportunities for pedestrians they are intended to provide connections between neighborhoods or between neighborhoods and community land uses and to interconnect sidewalk systems typically neighborhood trails should be located in or adjacent to neighborhoods open spaces or critical areas dforest path forest paths are narrow soft surface low impact trails that meander areas critical area buffers and forested areas with existing vegetation forest paths are constructed pursuant to us forest service standards to minimize impacts and to adapt to existing conditions such as steep slopes and heavily vegetated areas forest paths are low usage trails that provide an environmental and recreational experience additionally where these trails traverse areas subject to frequent inundation from water a boardwalktype tread may be used to enable pedestrian passage the intent of the forest path is to provide pedestrian connections areas such as uneven surfaces steeper grades rocks etc epedestrian trail pedestrian trails are developed when pedestrians are likely to be the primary users these hard surfaced trails provide direct connections for nonbicyclists in typically higher pedestrian traffic areas such as providing links to the multipurpose trails within the village center unlike other typically pedestrianoriented trails pedestrian

under this section supports or houses equipment described in subsections a1a and b of this section that has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process or under another state or local regulatory review process even if the structure was not built for the sole or primary purpose of providing that support the term does not include any structure that at the time the relevant application is filed with the city under this section does not support or house equipment described in subsections a1a and b of this section 2collocation the mounting or installation of transmission equipment on an eligible support structure for the purpose of transmitting andor receiving radio frequency signals for communication purposes 3eligible facilities request any request for modification of an existing tower or base station that does not substantially increase the physical dimensions of such tower or base station involving acollocation of new transmission equipment  bremoval of transmission equipment  or creplacement of transmission equipment 4eligible support structure any tower or base station as defined in this section  provided that it is existing at the time the relevant application is filed with the city 5existing a constructed tower or base station is existing if it has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process or under another state or local regulatory review process  provided that a tower that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a zoned area when it was built but was lawfully constructed is existing for purposes of this definition 6substantial change a modification substantially changes the physical dimensions of an eligible support structure if it meets any of the following criteria afor towers other than towers in the public rightsofway it increases the height of the tower by more than ten 10 percent or by the height of one 1 additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed twenty 20 feet whichever is greater  for other eligible support structures it increases the height of the structure by more than ten 10 percent or more than ten 10 feet whichever is greater 1changes in height should be measured from the original support structure in cases where deployments are or will be separated horizontally such as on buildings rooftops  in other circumstances changes in height should be measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were approved prior to the passage of the spectrum act  bfor towers other than towers in the public rightsofway it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower more than ten 10 feet or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance whichever is greater  for other eligible support structures it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than six 6 feet  cfor any eligible support structure it involves installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved but not to exceed four 4 cabinets  or for towers in the public streets and base stations it involves installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground if there are no preexisting ground cabinets associated with the structure or else involves installation of ground cabinets that are more than ten 10 percent larger in height or overall volume than any other ground cabinets associated with the structure  dit entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site  eit would defeat the concealment elements of
