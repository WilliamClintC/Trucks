or any entertainer or employee who solicits such drinks from any customer is deemed in violation of this use of cigarettes tobacco and vapor products 1 statement of purpose a the purpose of this ordinance is to protect the public health safety and welfare of the property and persons in the city by prohibiting persons under 21 years of age from possessing tobacco products and vapor products and prohibiting the sale of tobacco products and vapor products to persons under 21 years of age b persons under age 21 are prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing cigarettes and other tobacco products and retailers are prohibited from selling them to underage persons there are new tobaccoless products however commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes ecigarettes ecigars ecigarillos epipes ehookahs or electronic nicotine delivery systems which allow the user to simulate cigarette smoking these products may be purchased by underage persons and are being marketed without age restrictions or health warnings and come in different flavors that appeal to young people c ecigarettes and similar devices are a relatively new nicotine delivery system while devices vary in their appearance and specific method of operation they have a few basic elements in common a solution of water dissolved nicotine and other ingredients usually flavoring is heated with 23 a heating element usually batterypowered this vaporizes the nicotine solution which passes into a mouthpiece and is inhaled in a manner similar to cigarette smoking often glycerol or propylene glycol is added to the solution to give the appearance of smoke when the solution is vaporized the concentration of nicotine contained in the solution can be customized by the retailer to the buyers specifications and many manufacturers make nicotinefree solutions d the production and distribution of ecigarettes is now regulated by federal or state authorities and the us food and drug administration has not completed testing of these products but initial studies by the fda have determined that ecigarettes can increase nicotine addiction among young people and contain chemical ingredients known to be harmful which may expose users and the public to potential health risks e the use of ecigarettes and similar devices has increased significantly in recent years f existing studies on electronic smoking devices vapor emissions and cartridge contents have found a number of dangerous substances including chemicals known to cause cancer such as formaldehyde acetaldehyde lead nickel and chromium as well as pm 25 acrolein tin toluene and aluminum which are associated with a range of negative health effects such as skin eye and respiratory irritation neurological effects damage to reproductive systems and even premature death from heart attacks and stroke g some cartridges used by electronic smoking devices can be refilled with liquid nicotine solution creating the potential for exposure to dangerous concentrations of nicotine h clinical studies about the safety and efficacy of these products have not been submitted to the fda for the over 400 brands of electronic smoking devices that are on the market and for this reason consumers have no way of knowing whether electronic smoking devices are safe what types of potentially harmful chemicals the products contain and what dose of nicotine the products deliver i electronic smoking devices often mimic conventional tobacco products in shape size and color with the user exhaling a smokelike vapor similar in appearance to the exhaled smoke from cigarettes and other conventional tobacco products j the use of electronic smoking devices in smokefree locations threatens to undermine compliance with smoking regulations and revers the progress 24 that has been made in establishing a social norm that smoking is not permitted in public places and places of employment k it is the intent of this board in enacting the ordinance codified in this section to provide for the public health safety and welfare by facilitating uniform and consistent enforcement of smokefree air laws  by reducing the potential for renormalizing smoking in public places and places of employment  by reducing the potential for children to associate the use of electronic smoking devices with a normative or healthy lifestyle  and by prohibiting the sale or distribution of electronic smoking devices to underage persons l therefore the town board determines that prohibiting the sale giving or furnishing of ecigarettes to underage persons and prohibiting the purchase possession or use of ecigarettes by underage persons is in the towns best interest and will promote public health safety and welfare 2 definitions for the purpose of construction and

systems shall be determined in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the wisconsin statutes and wisconsin administrative all land divisions shall satisfy the environmental assessment criteria of this chapter 1509 condominium developments 1 purpose a the town board hereby finds that certain issues arise in condominium developments that require limited applicability of this chapter to condominium developments the state legislature has recognized that land division ordinances may apply to condominiums but that subdivision ordinances shall not impose burdens upon condominiums that are different from those imposed on other property of a similar character not subject to a declaration of condominium b the factor that makes this chapter applicable to a condominium development is the creation of multiple distinct property entities at or near the ground surface subject to property taxation as separate parcels with each property entity having different ownership and management the town determines that this factor makes a condominium development dissimilar both physically and in ownership from developments in which the land and improvements are under unitary ownership management and control c thus the town board hereby finds that new condominium developments can place impacts on community resources in the same manner as other new developments that are characterized by division of land into impacts include i additional population density  ii possibility of use of particular land in a manner unsuitable to the lands characteristics  iii additional demands upon town area parks recreation programs and areas utility facilities and schools  iv additional traffic and street use 2 portions of chapter applicable to condominium developments the following 18 this chapter shall apply to condominium developments a relating to land suitability and construction practices  b relating to preliminary plat approval the technical requirements for preliminary plats set forth in

improvements  f relating to dedication requirements  g relating to variances penalties and violations  h relating to impact fees 3 this section shall not apply to the following condominiums a any condominium plat recorded prior to the effective date of this chapter  b any conversion of a structure or structures in existence on the effective date of this chapter to a condominium after the effective date of this chapter unless additional residential or commercial units are created c any condominium plat where no actual land division results 1510 dedication and reservation of land 1

entertainment establishments may have an adverse secondary effect on the surrounding community because the sexual nature of the business may regardless of the intentions of the proprietors attract persons seeking prostitution or unlawful drugs or who are inclined to be disorderly or disruptive  b adult entertainment establishments are an intense commercial use which create a large volume of foot and automobile traffic in the vicinity of the establishment which may require police and other municipal services which may not be readily available in towns and which may conflict with the preservation of farmland by encouraging scattered commercial development  c adult entertainment establishments have their peak activity at hours and days which are incompatible with residential uses and have a larger customer volume than other entertainment establishments  d because of the potential for negative impacts on property values the peace and good order of the community and the welfare of individuals affected by adult entertainment establishments it is necessary to minimize the secondary effects of adult entertainment  e it is the intent of this section to protect the health safety

residents and developers and offers a broad description of the towns subdivision and development regulations it is not intended to be a substitute for review of the actual regulations nor is it intended to provide legal advice the application of the regulations to a specific project often depends on the nature location and scope of the specific project and this guide should not be construed as guarantee or contract of any nature standards for land divisions in the town in general subdividing property can be accomplished in the town given the proposal meets certain basic requirements see also attached chart density requirements the towns land division and subdivision lot and density standards traditional subdivisions in the town have an overall maximum density of one dwelling unit per 75000 square feet cluster subdivisions in the town have an overall maximum density of one dwelling unit per 60000 square feet this is approximately 06 to 07 dwelling units per gross acre inclusive of roadways parks and open space subdivisions in the towns transition area have a maximum density of one dwelling unit per 50000 square feet or approximately 087 unitsunit per acre traditional subdivisions in traditional subdivisions the minimum lot size is 65000 square feet a variance process exists in the towns ordinance for reducing the minimum lot size there is no open space requirement for traditional subdivisions other than parkland dedication requirements see below cluster subdivisions the town allows cluster subdivisions on parcels greater than 15 acres in size clustering allows the subdivider to create smaller individual lots than are normally allowed under traditional subdivision standards with a greater amount of space devoted in outlots the minimum lot size in a cluster subdivision is 25000 square feet the open space requirements vary based on the size of lots being created for each lot between 25000 and less than 40000 square feet the open space required is 60000 square feet minus the lot size  and 65000 square feet require 20000 square feet of open space if a plat contains a mix of traditional and cluster lots 10000 square feet of open space is required for each traditional lot over 65000 square feet in size in these mixed subdivisions the more restrictive density standards apply to the entire plat transition area cluster subdivision a transition area is defined in town ordinances adjacent to the future city of madison growth area it includes an area 12 mile west of pioneer road and pioneer road extended from the southern extent of the town up to old sauk road it allows for slightly higher densities between the future  2  city and existing town development the maximum density for cluster subdivisions in this transition area is one dwelling unit per 50000 square feet 087 unitsunit per acre the minimum lot size is 25000 square feet like nontransition area cluster subdivisions plus open space requirements which are less than are required for a cluster subdivision outside of the transition area the open space required depends on lot size for lots under 32700 square feet the open space required is 10000 square feet plus 32700 square feet minus the lot size for lots between 32700 and 65000 square feet the open space required is 5000 square feet transition area traditional subdivision traditional subdivisions in the transition area described above have a maximum overall density of one dwelling unit per 50000 square feet roadways and required open space may be included in the density calculations however being a traditional subdivision a variance is still required to remove the minimum lot size requirement of 65000 square feet per lot this variance process is outlined in town ordinances certified survey maps csms up to 4 lots can be created by use of a csm csm lots have many of the same requirements as platted lots created as part of a traditional or cluster subdivision but there are some differences including 1 csm lots must have a minimum lot size of 65000 square feet 15 acres exclusive of rightof way regardless of location specific variance criteria are outlined in the ordinance if this standard cannot be met parkland dedication when land within the town is subdivided a dedication of 5000 square feet of parkland is required per lot or per dwelling unit created whichever is greater in areas where the town does not desire land dedication a fee of $2255 per lot inlieu of parkland dedication is required the towns comprehensive plan recreational trail plan park and outdoor recreation plan or other plans indicate where the town desires trails and parks it is up to the discretion of the town board to require land dedication fee in lieu of parkland dedication or a combination of both other special planning areas in addition to the standard ordinances there are 4 specific areas in the town which have special controls on land use and subdivision these areas are 1 future city of madison area lands east of a line roughly defined by the east edge of pope farm park pioneer road and meadow road see intergovernmental agreement for definition of boundary line are subject to city of madison development standards and possible annexation therefore any request for subdivision change in land use or development needs to be requested from the city of madison and town of middleton 2 madison intergovernmental agreement area the 2003 city of madison and town of middleton cooperative plan specifies standards and land uses for development within  mile of the future city border described above  3  3 city of middleton extraterritorial jurisdiction etj review area certain areas of the town are within an extraterritorial review area and land divisions are subject to review by the city of middleton as described by a 1994 intergovernmental agreement see agreement or attached map for area and specifications 4 tumbledown neighborhood in 2005 the town undertook a neighborhood planning process for the area between pioneer mineral point and valley view roads a future land use and roadway network plan was developed with recommendations for the future development of the area see attached map for tumbledown neighborhood location other issues to be aware of major roadway buffer zones development along roadways defined as collectors or arterials in town ordinances is required to include a landscape buffer of 80 adjacent to the roadway requirements for grading and vegetation within this buffer can also be found in the towns road impact fee the town has adopted an ordinance to recoup costs associated with the reconstruction of airport road each new lot created in the designated area contact town engineer for maps will be charged $115500 application review fees the town requires a deposit for the review of applications for land divisions and zoningrelated applications this fee is used to reimburse the town for its costs in reviewing the proposal including costs for the town engineer planner and attorney this fee must be received by the town before any review will take place if the applicant is unsure of the projects feasibility and wishes to have it evaluated as a concept by the plan commission before a formal submittal the applicant shall submit a deposit for this initial review with the potential of being required to submit an additional deposit upon submitting a formal proposal the review fees incurred depend solely on the time required by the town engineer planner and attorney to review the concept or to resolve plat csm zoning andor legal issues rezoning for land divisions when the new county zoning adopted in early 201 new zoning districts were mapped for the town the town policy is that residential parcels under 5 acres that are created by plat or csm should be rezoned from at5 ag transition zoning which is intended for unplatted lands and larger parcels to sfr08 singlefamily residential zoning intended for residential developed lots the town intends to handle these rezonings annual blanket rezone request to dane county at no cost to land owners rezoning is not required if the current land use is permitted in the at5 district but not in sfr08 in which case rezoning to sfr08 would make the use nonconforming with zoning  4  review & approval process the land division and subdivision ordinance includes complete details on submittal requirements and the approval process land divisions generally follow the same process 1 a preliminary consultation with town staff to discuss the general idea and overall conformance with ordinances 2 formal submittal of a csm or preliminary plat is made to the town clerk at least 21 days before the plan commission meeting where it is to be considered copies of the submittal go to the commissioners and town engineer before the meeting the town engineer prepares a written review of the land division 3 at the plan commission meeting the submittal is reviewed and the commission makes a recommendation to approve or deny the land division to the town board 4 at the town park commission meeting the submittal is reviewed and the commission makes a recommendation to the board regarding parks and trails 5 at the town board meeting a public hearing is held by the town board to consider the land division and invite public input the town board makes a decision to approve approve conditionally or reject the csm or plat within 90 days of a complete application 6 if the preliminary plat is approved and a final plat is submitted within 36 months of that approval the final plat is entitled to approval with respect to layout the final plat still has specific submittal requirements and is reviewed by the plan commission park commission and town board 7 the town board makes a decision to approve approve conditionally or reject the final plat within 60 days of formal submittal by the applicant however the town board requires two meetings on the final plat  one to complete the initial review of the plat and a final meeting to approve a developer agreement and finalize the plat approval including any conditions of approval that remain notes 1 applicants are strongly encouraged to meet with the town administrator and town engineer before preparing a land division the meeting is very useful to confirm what is required of the applicant the timeline for review and approval and the anticipated costs to be borne by the applicant 2 certified survey maps are not required to gain preliminary and final approval therefore the approval process generally follows steps 15 above please refer to the latest town ordinances town fee schedule and dane county zoning more information on the following  approval process  submittal requirements  landscape
