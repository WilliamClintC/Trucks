use categories residential office commercial and industrial a the three residential zones provide for a wide range of residential living opportunities each zone establishes residential use as the primary and preferred use a limited set of uses that are related to residential use of property are also permitted the greater density associated with a concentration of twofamily and multiplefamily development requires separate zones for these uses land is intended to be rezoned to the higher intensity residential districts only when public services are adequate and only in locations consistent with the city of st joseph comprehensive plan b the commercial office district serves as a transition zone to buffer low intensity adjacent uses usually residential from nearby higher intensity uses usually commercial it also provides a separate zone with a limited number of other compatible uses so as to protect investments made in office structures c the commercial district is designed to meet the needs for general business in the city the commercial district is expected to remain limited in size and location and expanded only when growing demand cannot be met by land in the current zone and when expansion is consistent with both the policies and future land use map of the city of st joseph comprehensive plan d the downtown district is designed to be convenient and attractive for the needs of nearby office workers and residents and for shoppers and tourists arriving by automobile and parking once to carry out several errands intensive development of shopping and service facilities

use classes and authorized uses  definitions of use classes a use classes arrange land uses and activities into use categories based on common functional product or physical characteristics characteristics include the type and amount of activity the type of customers or residents how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions the categories provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts b when all principal uses of a development fall within one use category the entire development is assigned to that use category a development that contains a coffee shop delicatessen and bakery for example would be classified in the food and drink service establishments category because all of the developments principal uses are in that category when the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that category a mail order facility may simply be a call center or it may have warehouse or storage facilities on site the zoning administrator shall classify the facility into the proper zoning district based on the characteristics of the use c accessory uses are permitted in conjunction with a principal use subject to any special regulations applicable to it and to the regulations applicable to the principal use if there are no special regulations see also for additional accessory use regulations d the list of examples of authorized uses on table 41 lists common examples of uses included in the respective use category the names of these sample uses are generic they are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself for example a use that calls itself wholesale warehouse but that sells mostly to consumers is included in the general retail establishments category rather than the wholesale trade establishments category this is because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the general retail establishments category e many uncategorized uses are special uses for which particular standards are provided in others are basic uses allowed by right some uses are listed in more than one category eg drugstores as convenience retail and also as medical service establishments f the limited neighborhood business class is a unique use class intended to recognize the circumstances peculiar to a number of nonconforming uses a use which on a particular lot at a particular time meets the definition of a limited neighborhood business shall be considered to belong to the limited neighborhood business use class rather than to its ordinary use class for example a coffee shop would ordinarily be considered a food and drink service establishment  if that coffee shop were located in a residential district or proposed to be located in a residential district and otherwise meets the definition of a limited neighborhood business it would instead be considered a limited neighborhood business if the lot should be rezoned to a nonresidential district the use would no longer be considered a limited neighborhood business but would be considered a food and drink service establishment and would be a conforming use or nonconforming use depending on the authorized uses of the new zoning district

ebod edgewater beach overlay district  intent the edgewater beach overlay district ebod is an overlay district intended to preserve the character of the public trust land along the shore of lake michigan which is found to be a valuable public resource of the community to prevent damage to the public trust land and to prevent damage to private property based on the record presented the city finds that during periods of low lake michigan water levels sand accretion in this district tends to significantly enlarge the beach and to enlarge affected parcels in this district this additional land area can be seen by property owners as permanent and attractive for development the character of the public trust land along the lake michigan shoreline as well as viewsheds along the shoreline from public parks included in and adjacent to this district is compromised by development in immediate proximity to the public trust land based on the record presented the city further finds that the beach and property area near the shoreline is subject to submergence and erosion during periods of higher lake michigan water levels and resulting from weather conditions it has been demonstrated that current state and federal development standards for the lake michigan shoreline such as the ordinary high water mark ohwm and the base flood elevation do not special districts city of st joseph zoning ordinance amendments  effective  916 ensure that property shoreward of those locations is protected from erosion inundation or damage during such periods of time andor weather events the ohwm is not intended to reflect these periods of peril and the base flood elevation is a still water elevation that does not take into account the effect of wave action the city further understands that revised federal floodplain regulations are being developed to take into account additional environmental factors such as waves and to provide an improved standard of floodplain development protection but implementation of these regulations will not likely occur for several years when erosion threatens a structure legally built near the shoreline a natural reaction for the owner is to attempt to construct a seawall or implement similar shore protection measures shore protection measures in this district would diminish significantly the character of the public trust land and pose an increased threat of erosion and damage to the public trust land as well as to adjacent private property the city has long experience with the detrimental effects of seawalls and shore protection structures constructed over a period of many years in response to erosion south of the st joseph river these shore protection structures were and are necessary to protect previously developed areas of the city which are otherwise subject to regular and ongoing erosion however given the physical environmental and developmental characteristics of the ebod including generally large lots which need not be developed near to the waters edge to be economically viable and that the area is generally benefitting from accretion rather than persistent erosion the city believes that shore protection measures should not be necessary in this area and would be detrimental to the public health safety and welfare for reasons further identified and set forth in the city of st joseph michigan coastal engineering study dated  a copy of which is on file with the city the city believes the most appropriate effective and reasonable method to further the public interests of protecting natural resources  preserving the economic and environmental wellbeing of the community  to protect the health safety and general welfare of the community  and the general preservation or enhancement of property values is to restrict the construction of structures so near to the waters edge as to be detrimental to the character of the public trust property andor the vistas from neighboring public parks  andor to be susceptible to damage resulting from inundation or erosion or to create an apparent future need for seawalls or other shore protection measures in order to protect these structures from damage resulting from inundation or erosion  andor to be potentially built in a location that will render the structure nonconforming under the future federal floodplain protection regulations currently under development these regulations are intended to preserve the character of the public trust property along the shoreline protect the vistas from neighboring public parks and prevent the construction of structures and shore protection measures which would have deleterious effects on the public trust property as well as neighboring private property these regulations are also supported by the comprehensive plan as the future land use map indicates lakefront property in this area should be used as open space and the supporting text indicates that open space areas should be maintained
