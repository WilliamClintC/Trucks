a 1 2 3 4 5 6 b 1 2 c  4728 condominium developments purpose the common council hereby finds that certain issues arise in condominium developments that require limited applicability of this chapter to condominium developments the state legislature has recognized that subdivision ordinances may apply to condominiums but that subdivision ordinances shall not impose burdens upon condominiums that are different from those imposed on other property of a similar character not subject to a declaration of condominium the factor that makes this chapter applicable to a condominium development is the creation of multiple distinct property entities at or near the ground surface subject to property taxation as separate parcels with each property entity having different ownership and management the city determines that this factor makes a condominium development dissimilar both physically and in ownership from developments in which the land and improvements are under unitary ownership management and control thus the common council hereby finds that new condominium developments can place impacts on community resources in the same manner as other new developments which are characterized by division of land into lots these impacts include additional population density possibility of use of particular land in a manner unsuitable to the lands characteristics additional demands upon city area parks recreation areas utility facilities and schools additional traffic and street use portions of chapter applicable to condominium developments the following sections of this chapter shall apply to condominium developments relating to land suitability and construction practices relating to preliminary and final plat approval the technical requirements for preliminary plats set forth in
