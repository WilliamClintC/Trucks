variances arises from conditions that are unique to the subject property that are not ordinarily found in the same zoning district and that are not a result of the owners intentional action  2 the granting of the permit for the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents  3 the strict application of the applicable standards will constitute an

that the spirit of this ldc shall be observed and substantial justice done in considering all proposed variances to this ldc the board shall before making any finding in a specified case first determine that the proposed variances will not constitute any change in the district boundaries shown on the zoning map and will not impair any adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property or materially increase the public danger of fire and to safety or physical attributes of property within the surrounding area or in any other respect impair the public health safety and general welfare b in granting a zoning provision variance the board may impose thereto such conditions regarding the location character and other features of the proposed building structure or use as it may deem advisable in furtherance of the purposes of this ldc before such a variance is granted it shall be shown that special circumstances attach to the property that are unique and do not generally apply to other property in the neighborhood a zoning provision variance may be granted only when the practical difficulty of undue or unnecessary hardship complained of is due to the particular characteristics of the property are not selfimposed by the applicant and are not general conditions of the neighborhood which may reflect a stringency of the ldc itself a hardship peculiar to the applicants property as distinguished from others affected by the general rule must be shown c the board may grant a variance in the dimensional yard requirements of this ldc only where by reason of exceptional narrowness shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property or where due to the topographical conditions of a piece of property the strict application of the said dimensional requirements of this ldc would

be recorded in the permanent record of the case and shall include the factual reasons on which they are based a there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the ldc in order to determine that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships the board must find that the following five 5 conditions exist 1 if the provisions of the ldc are complied with a variance will only be granted if the applicant can secure no reasonable return from nor make reasonable use of the property merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify the board in granting a variance moreover the board shall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of the ldc that will make possible the reasonable use of the property 2 the hardship results from the application of the ldc to the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions personal actions personal circumstances or other hardship 3 the hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicants property such as its size shape or topography which is different from that of neighboring property 4 the hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly violates the ldc or who purchases the property after the effective date of the ldc and then comes to the board for relief 5 the hardship is peculiar to the applicants property rather than the result of conditions that are widespread or common to adjoining owners or the general public if the properties were equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction then granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to others and would not promote equal justice b the variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the ldc and preserves its spirit c in the granting of the variance the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice has been done the board shall not grant a variance if it finds that doing so would in any respect impair the public health safety or general welfare 1 in granting the variance the board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location character and other features of the proposed building structure or use as it may deem advisable in furtherance of the purpose of this ldc if a variance for the construction alteration of use of property is granted such construction alteration or use shall be in accordance with the approved site plan 2 the board of adjustment shall refuse to hear an appeal or an application for a variance previously denied if it finds that there have been no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or application 3 a variance issued in accordance with this section shall expire when the building permit for such use has not been obtained by the applicant within six 6 months from the date of the decision 4 the board of adjustment shall keep a record of all projects for which it grants a variance a description of each project receiving a variance by the board during the previous calendar year and the reason for granting the variance shall be submitted to the division of environmental management on or before the first day of january of the following year 5 if the application calls for the granting of a variance and if the board of adjustment decides in favor of granting the variance the board shall prepare a preliminary record of the hearing with all deliberate speed the preliminary record of the hearing shall include a the variance application  b the hearing notices  c the evidence presented  d motions offers of proof objections to evidence and rulings on them  e proposed findings and exceptions  f the proposed decision including all conditions proposed to be added to the permit the fact that property may be utilized more profitably will not be considered as a justification for granting a zoning variance by the board 3 variances adult establishments the board of adjustment shall consider all requests for variances in the separation requirements for adult establishments all of the provisions of subsection 2 above variance findings generally shall apply to a request for a variance in the separation requirements in addition the board of adjustment shall grant such variance only when it finds a the proposed use will not be injurious to property values in the affected area  b the proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the development of a skid row area  c the permitting of an adult establishment in the area will not be contrary to any governmental program of neighborhood conservation rehabilitation improvements or revitalization  d the proposed

general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c minimize and control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  52813 statutory authorization the legislature of the state of north carolina has in of   parts 3 5 and 8 of of   and of of the north carolina general statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry  52813 findings of fact and objectives a findings of fact 1 the areas of special flood hazard of the city are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 the areas of special flood hazard also include those defined engineering analysis for private developments or by governmental agencies but which have not yet been incorporated in the flood insurance study for the county of nash this includes detailed flood information generated as required by this ordinance b objectives 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  and 7 to promote the notification that property is in a flood area to potential homebuyers  52813 establishment of zoning overlay and scope of authority a there is hereby established a floodplain protection zoning overlay district floodplain protection

manner to protect the various drainage areas in the city from flooding  to provide clean and sanitary channels for runoff  to prevent pollution of watersheds streams and natural drainage channels  to prevent the encroachment of buildings and improvements on natural drainage channels  to equitably apportion the cost of improvements  to protect natural scenic areas  to provide for the conservation of the natural resources of the area and to implement resolutions established by the federal emergency management administration fema 2 all subdivisions of land and all improvements of any character which affect drainage in any portion of the city shall be subject to the provisions of these regulations for the protection of public health safety and general welfare of the city b finding of fact the periodic flooding of areas within the city results in hazards to life and property in the disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare flood and associated losses are caused by the location in flood hazard areas of buildings structures and uses of land which are inadequately protected from flooding and erosion and which contribute to flooding by impeding the flow of drainage and by increasing flood heights of stormwater in flood hazard areas c classification of drainage channels for the purpose of these regulations drainage shall be classified as follows 1 surface drainage is runoff of such a limited quantity andor slow rate that it does not cause erosion of a defined channel 2 a minor tributary is any drainage channel having a drainage basin of one hundred 100 acres or less in area 3 a major tributary is any channel having a drainage basin of not less than one 1 square mile or greater than twentyfive 25 square miles d designation of responsibility it is intended that responsibility for drainage be allocated as follows unless otherwise specifically designated 1 the developer of a subdivision is responsible for the following a construction of facilities to accommodate the increased surface drainage within the subdivision and future developed flows from upstream properties and shall convey same to a point on an identified existing watercourse or storm drainage network system such storm drainage system shall have the hydraulic capability to accommodate the increased surface water flow or be modified by the developer in a manner which will do so b obtaining offsite flowage easements and the construction of facilities to accommodate increased flow such shall be dedicated to the city where such offsite facilities are necessary the city shall allow the developer the option of constructing onsite retarding and retention structures to limit the peak flow to predeveloped rates when environmental and economic conditions prohibit or make unfeasible offsite improvements c the improvement of all minor and major tributaries and channels lying within the subdivision d mitigate any increase in rate or quantity of runoff in any storm drain pipe minor or major tributary or major channel which results from the development of the subdivision e provision for the maintenance of all stormwater systems and fringe areas of tributaries and channels which have not been dedicated to the public 2 the city and other levels of government will be responsible for the maintenance of drainage facilities dedicated to the public e drainage and sewers outside subdivision boundaries the city reserves the right to require improvements provisions of drainage easements and for provision of agreements beyond the boundaries of the subdivision to facilitate flow of water addition to avoid probability of law suits based on damage from changed runoff in the subdivision and to provide continuous improvement of the overall storm drainage system requirements outside the addition may include

widening or deepening of the channel e construction of erosion control structures f back sloping sodding andor rip rapping of bank g construction of closed or open paved storm sewers for the purposes of closing gap or continuation of overall storm sewer system 3 property owner agreements where required shall be designed to protect the city from probable lawsuits for damage caused by changed runoff condition 4 when subdivision development will result in increased runoff beyond the boundaries of the subdivision which cannot be accommodated improvements without causing downstream flooding or erosion the planning board may require the construction of one 1 or more retention reservoirs on the subdivision which will temporarily impound and discharge water from the subdivision site at the rate of volume equivalent to the discharge from the underdeveloped subdivision site at a rate and volume that the offsite channel is capable of taking the design shall be as indicated in the citys

acceptance by the city of open space specifically for park land without monetary compensation by the city to the subdivider andor in case of property located within the floodway andor property constituting the fifty 50 foot arterial buffer required for residential development adjacent to major arterials the following bonus density provision may be employed  however in no case may a lot be reduced in area or frontage below the minimum requirement of the next higher density singlefamily zoning designation the bonus density design provision is applied in the following manner 1 the square footage of the area reserved for parkopen space floodway or arterial buffer purposes is divided by the square footage of the total area to be subdivided  2 the minimum lot area and frontage of the lot requirements specified by the zone of the subject property is multiplied by the resulting quotient representative of the percentage of land eliminated from residential land use development obtained from step 1 above  3 the resulting lot area and lot frontage of step 2 is then considered to be the minimum lot specifications upon which the subdivision may be designed b for example if a thirty 30 acre tract of land were zoned r15 minimum lot area of fifteen thousand 15000 square feet and lot frontage of one hundred 100 feet and the subdivider desires to dedicate three 3 acres of land the bonus density design provision would be applied as follows 1 3 acres   43560  3   130680 square feet  43560  30   1306800 square feet  1306801306800   10 percent 2 minimum lot area r15 15000  10 percent
