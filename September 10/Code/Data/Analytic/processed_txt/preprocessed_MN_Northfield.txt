the existence of rental properties occupied by groups of unrelated adults where occupants tend to have more motor vehicles generate greater traffic and parking congestion and generate other adverse impacts on the neighborhood such as noise and disorderly conduct in addition the council finds that rental houses tend not to be as well or as aesthetically maintained as owneroccupied houses and that

administrative citations and civil penalties a purpose the city council finds that there is a need for alternative methods of enforcing the rental housing ordinance while criminal fines and penalties have been the most frequent enforcement mechanism there are certain negative consequences for both the city and the accused the delay inherent in the criminal justice system does not ensure prompt resolution of problems which affect the public interest individuals may resent being labeled as criminals for violation of administrative regulations the higher burden of proof and the potential of being incarcerated do not appear appropriate for many administrative violations the court system does not always regard city code violations as being important accordingly the city council finds that the use of administrative citations and the imposition of civil penalties is a legitimate and necessary alternative method of enforcement this method of enforcement is in addition to any other legal remedy that may be pursued for violation of this article b general provisions 1 a violation of any provision of this article is an administrative offense which shall be subject to an administrative citation and civil penalties each day a violation exists constitutes a separate offense 2 an administrative offense shall be subject to a civil penalty not exceeding $200000 3 the city council shall

for the specific use in all districts unless otherwise specified in addition to all other applicable provisions of this ldc  adult uses a findings and purpose  studies conducted by the minnesota attorney general the american planning association and the texas city attorneys association and cities such as st paul minnesota  indianapolis indiana hopkins minnesota ramsey minnesota  rochester minnesota  phoenix arizona  los angeles california  seattle washington  st croix county wisconsin  adams county and the city of denver colorado have studied the impacts that adult establishments have in those communities these studies have concluded that adult establishments have adverse impacts on the surrounding neighborhoods these impacts include increased crime rates lower property values increased transience neighborhood blight and potential health risks the adverse impacts which adult uses have on surrounding areas diminish as the distance from the adult establishments increases based on these studies and findings the city council concludes 1 adult establishments have adverse secondary impacts of the types set forth above on the neighborhoods surrounding them which is distinct from the impact caused by other commercial uses 2 the adverse impacts caused by adult establishments tend to diminish if adult establishments are governed by geographic licensing and health requirements 3 it is not the intent of the city council to prohibit adult establishments from having a reasonable opportunity to locate in the city 4 many members of the public perceive areas within which adult establishments are located as less safe than other areas that do not have such uses 5 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the adult establishment a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the adult establishment is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the residents of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult establishment fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 6 the fact that an applicant for an adult establishment license has been convicted of a sexuallyrelated crime is rationally related to the legitimate concern that the applicant may engage in similar criminal conduct in the future 7 the barring of individuals with sexuallyrelated criminal convictions from the management of adult establishments for a period of time serves as a deterrent to future criminal conduct 8 the general health safety and welfare of the community are promoted by prohibiting nudity in adult establishments this prohibition is based on concerns of potential adverse effects such as prostitution the transmission of sexuallytransmitted diseases exposure to minors obscenity and unsanitary conditions in public places 9 smaller cities throughout minnesota experience many of the same adverse impacts of adult establishments that are present in larger metropolitan communities 10 the public health safety morals and general welfare will be promoted by the city adopting regulations governing adult establishments 11 the city council finds the characteristics of the city are substantially similar to those of the cities cited when considering the effects of adult establishments 12 the city council finds based upon the report and the studies cited that adult uses may have adverse secondary effects upon certain preexisting land uses within the city and that the public health safety and general welfare will be promoted if the city adopts regulations regarding adult uses 13 the city council finds that the adverse secondary effects tend to diminish if adult uses in the city are regulated by locational and licensing requirements b permitted location for adult uses  only one adult use establishment is allowed per freestanding building adult use establishments shall be located at least 500 feet as measured in a straight line from the main public entrance of

attached or detached garages is i to ensure that there is a physical and visual connection between the living area of the home and the street  ii to ensure that the location and amount of living space of the home as seen from the street is more prominent than the garage  iii to prevent garages from obscuring the main entrance from the street and ensure that the main entrance for pedestrians rather than automobiles is the prominent entrance  iv provide for a more pleasant pedestrian environment by preventing garages from dominating the views of the neighborhood from the sidewalk  and v enhance

nexus and proportionality 1 purpose  these requirements are established for the purpose of assisting with the implementation of the parks open space and trail system plan of the city of northfield by providing for the orderly development of recreation areas and the conservation of natural resources and scenic beauty in the city the parks open space and trail system plan promotes a balanced and systematic approach to acquiring park and open space resources that include active park facilities an interconnected trail system areas of natural and ecological significance emphasizing the cannon river corridor that is available to residents of the city and the broader region as a means to accomplish these goals each developer shall be required to dedicate land or at the discretion of the city pay an equivalent cash payment in lieu of land dedication for parks and open space acquisition and development the policy of the city is to acquire and manage larger parcels of park and open space land resources  therefore as a result of this policy it is likely that a cash payment in lieu of land dedication will be the method by which this requirement will be accomplished in most instances although not to the complete exclusion of a land dedication requirement 2 nexus  the city council finds that there is a rational nexus between the demands created by the subdivision and related development of land and the need for parks trails open space areas public art and facilities 3 proportionality  further the city council herein establishes requirements for the dedication andor development of park land trail improvements and open space land that is roughly proportionate to the demands created by the subdivision and development of land resulting from such subdivision approval b authority  it is found and declared that pursuant to minn stat   subd 2b it is reasonable to require dedication of an amount of land equal in value to that percentage of the undeveloped land set forth in d land dedication required c waiver of requirements  upon a request by the developer the city council may waive or reduce the requirements of this section for development in the c1 downtown

greater benefit to the city in comparison to parks trail and open space improvements  2 that development in areas zoned edf district which results in significant increases in tax revenues to the city or significantly increases employment opportunities is of greater benefit to the city in comparison to parks trail or open space improvements  3 that development in areas zoned n2 district which allows for the construction of affordable housing units of a type price or amount that is determined to be of greater benefit to the city in comparison to parks trail or open space improvements  or 4 that cityassisted development or redevelopment projects achieve public objectives d land dedication required  1 in every plat replat or subdivision of land allowing development for residential

city shall use one of two methods of calculating special assessments for public improvement projects or a combination of those methods depending on the circumstances of the project the front foot method or the per lot method the feasibility report for a project shall recommend one or a combination of these methods for the project based upon what method or combination of methods will best reflect the special benefit of the project to the properties to be assessed the city council will approve the selected methods of calculating assessments at the time the project is ordered the front foot method and the per lot method are described as follows 1 front foot method an assessment rate per front foot of the properties abutting on a public improvement is determined based upon a preliminary benefit appraisal provided to the city by a licensed certified general real property appraiser using comparable sales of land with and without public improvements of the type proposed to be built the appraiser determines the value of one or more typical parcels in the project area before and after the subject improvement project the difference in these values is the benefit of the project to the property the benefit is divided by the length of the propertys frontage on the improvement project in order to obtain a per front foot value based on that appraisal a total front foot value is assigned to each parcel within the project area using its actual or adjusted front footage abutting the project as described belowto determine the special assessment against that property because different parcels vary greatly in front footage back and side footage area and configuration and yet each similar property for instance each single family home uses public improvements approximately equally the city will adopt and employ a means of adjusting for these variations in size and configuration and arriving at an adjusted front footage in order to render the allocation of assessments for public improvements reasonable fair and equitable among all affected properties 2 per lot method the per lot method of assessment is based on equal assessment of all lots or parcels within the benefited area this method may be used upon recommendation of city staff and approval of the council when the circumstances of the project andor the property benefited by the project warrant the assessment per lot is the quotient of the total estimated special benefit of the project to the project area divided by the total number of assessable lots or parcels benefiting from the improvement  secs 66366644  reserved article v  financing and payment payment of assessments  prepayment special assessment is one method by which the city finances the cost of public improvement projects which benefit certain properties assessments are levied against properties benefited by the project at the start of the project and property owners may pay the assessments back over a period of years the assessment period the assessment roll adopted by the council is certified to the county auditor who collects the assessments together with real estate taxes over the assessment period the city is able to issue bonds to pay for the project at the outset and then pay off the bonds with payments received from property owners over the assessment period property owners may pay special assessments to the county with their real estate taxes over the assessment period such payments include equal installments of principal with interest on the declining principal balance alternatively property owners may prepay assessments using one of the following options 1 they may pay all or part of the assessments to the city within 30 days after the council adopts the assessment roll in which case the city will not charge any interest on the amount paid 2 they may pay all or part of the assessments to the city after the 30 day period but before the assessment roll has been certified to the county auditor in which case they must pay interest which has accrued on the amount paid date of payment 3 at any time after certification of the assessment roll to the county auditor property owners may pay all or part but not less than $50000 of the remaining principal balance of the assessments to the city any payment that is made before november 15 of any year will be reported to the county auditor by november 30 of that year and the county auditor will reduce the principal balance owing and recalculate the amount of principal and interest to be paid over the remainder of the assessment period  interest the city will charge interest on special assessments at the rate specified in the resolution adopting the assessment roll if bonds were sold to finance the improvement project the interest rate will be two percent more than the average interest rate of the bonds rounded to the nearest quarter of a percent if no bonds were sold the interest rate will be two percent more than the average interest rate of the last bond issue sold by the city  discretionary deferral of special assessments in certain limited circumstances the council has discretion to defer special assessments for future collection in these circumstances assessments are adopted and certified to the county auditor but are not collected until a specified time or until the occurrence of a specified event all deferred assessments constitute liens on the property assessed until the assessments are paid the council shall determine by ordinance or resolution the amount of interest on deferred assessments and 1 whether it must be paid annually during the period of deferment at the same times as the principal installments would have been payable if not deferred or 2 whether interest for the period of deferment should be added to the principal amount of the assessment when it becomes payable or 3 whether if so provided in the resolution levying the assessment interest thereon to december 31 of the year before the first installment is payable will be forgiven there are two types of discretionary deferrals 1 senior citizen disability active military service and other hardship deferrals the

the basis of exceptional and unusual circumstances not covered by other standards and guidelines where the determination is made in a nondiscriminatory manner and does not give the applicant an unreasonable preference or advantage over other applicants  provided that in each such case the council has determined that it would be a hardship for the owner to make the payments under subsection 4 above the council may limit the deferment to one year or to a limited period of years and may require regular verification by the applicant of the continuation of the exceptional and unusual circumstances that justify the deferment b if an applicant for deferral falls into one of the foregoing categories hardship shall be determined based upon the applicant meeting one or more of the following conditions 1 gross household income is at or under united states department of housing and urban development hud low income limits adjusted for the year and household size 2 unusually high medical expenses relative to income 3 other conditions found by the council to justify deferment c except as otherwise expressly determined by the council in the resolution approving deferment a hardship deferment ends and all accumulated amounts including applicable interest if any become due 1 upon the death of the owner if the spouse is not otherwise eligible for deferment  2 upon the sale transfer or subdivision of any part of the property  3 upon loss of homestead status  or 4 upon the councils determination that immediate or partial payment would impose no hardship 2 unimproved property the council may in its discretion defer special assessments against unimproved property as allowed by minn stat   sub 2 payment of the first installment of any assessment levied upon unimproved property may in the councils discretion be deferred until a designated future year or until the platting of the property or the construction of improvements thereon upon such terms and conditions and based upon such standards and criteria as may be provided by resolution of the council when such an assessment becomes payable it must be divided into a number of installments such that the last installment thereof will be payable not more than 30 years after the levy of the assessment 3 review of application for deferral the city administrator or hisher designee shall review
