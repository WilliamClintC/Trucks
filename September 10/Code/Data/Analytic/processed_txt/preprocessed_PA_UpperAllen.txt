when regulated waste streams subject to a federal categorical pretreatment standard are mixed with unregulated waste streams the township may impose alternate limits using the combined waste stream formula found in 40 cfr 4036e 2 where a federal categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either mass or concentration for a pollutant the township may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 cfr 4036c 3 when the limits in a federal categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the township convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the township the township may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all of the conditions outlined in 40 cfr 4036c5 as set forth below a to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must  employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit   currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable federal categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment   provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions   not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and  have consistently complied with all applicable federal categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits 20053 rental property registration of 20053  b an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must  maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits   continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device   continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the township whenever production rates are expected to increase by more than 20% from its baseline production rates determined in 3a of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the township will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and  continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to 3a and a of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit c when developing equivalent mass limits the township  will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable federal categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor   upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and  may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to  20056 of this chapter the industrial user must also be in compliance with  20093 of of these regulations  the township may not express limits in terms of mass for pollutants such as ph temperature radiation or other 20053 upper allen code 20053  pollutants which cannot appropriately be expressed as mass 4 the township may convert the mass limits of federal categorical pretreatment standards at 40 cfr 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users when converting such limits to concentration limits the township will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 cfr 414 419 and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as stated in  20056 of this chapter 5 if a federal categorical pretreatment standard contains pretreatment standards for both daily maximum and fourday average the same production or flow

steep slope protection ssp overlay district  24591 purpose the purpose of the steep slope protection ssp overlay district is to conserve and protect those areas having slopes as defined herein from inappropriate development as well as to permit and encourage the use of said areas for open space purposes in order to constitute a harmonious aspect of the continuing physical development of the township in implementing these principles and the general purposes of this chapter and the upper allen township comprehensive plan the following specific objectives are intended to be accomplished by this article a to combine with other zoning requirements as an overlay zoning district certain restrictions for steep slope areas to promote the general health safety and welfare of the residents of the township b to prevent inappropriate development of steep slope areas in order to avoid potential dangers for human usage caused by erosion stream siltation and soil failure leading to structural collapse or damage and or unsanitary conditions and associated hazards c to minimize danger to public health and safety by promoting safe and sanitary drainage d to relate the intensity of development to the steepness of terrain in order to minimize grading removal of vegetation runoff and erosion and to help ensure the utilization of land in accordance with its natural capabilities to support development e to promote only those uses in steep slope areas that are compatible with the preservation of existing natural features including vegetative cover by restricting the grading of steep slope areas f to promote the ecological balance among those natural systems elements such as wildlife vegetation and aquatic life that could be grossly affected by inappropriate development of steep slope areas g to prevent the development that would cause excessive erosion and a resultant reduction in the watercarrying capacity of the watercourses which flow around the township with the consequences of increased flood crests and flood hazards within the township and to both upstream and downstream municipalities h to minimize the potential harmful effects to individuals and adjacent landowners in the township andor other municipalities caused by inappropriate grading and development on steep slopes i to advise those individuals who choose despite the dangers to develop or occupy land with steep slopes  to protect residents from property  24591 transient retail businesses  24591   24592 boundary definition of district  24593 steep slope protection overlay district concept the

have no effect on the permitted uses or regulations in the underlying zoning district except where the development intended is to be located within the boundaries of the ssp district as defined herein is in conflict with the permitted uses or regulations set forth in this section b in those areas of upper allen township where the ssp district applies the requirements of the ssp district shall supersede any less stringent requirements of the underlying zoning district c should the zoning classification of any parcel or any part thereof on which the ssp district is an overlay be changed such change in the classification shall have no effect on the boundaries of the ssp district unless an amendment to said boundaries was included as part of the proceedings from which the change originated

the boundary as set forth in  24596 herein are incorrect because of changes due to natural or other causes may appeal such decision to the zoning hearing board as provided in of this chapter  24595
