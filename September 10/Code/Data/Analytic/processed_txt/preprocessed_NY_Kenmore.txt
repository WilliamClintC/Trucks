hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  2 such stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  3 clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  4 improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation  5 impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow  6 substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the village  7 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  8 the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety  and 9 regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development b purpose the purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater

findings general rules and definitions a purpose and goals the purpose of planned unit development pud districts is to use the authority granted by village law  7703a and municipal home rule law to promote flexibility in development in order to better achieve community goals and to promote consistency with the comprehensive plan the village board of trustees hereby finds that when coordinated with the comprehensive plan planned unit development is an effective tool for guiding development in ways that support the communitys goals and priorities planned unit development among other things provides a means by which different land uses within an area covered by a single development plan may be combined to achieve compatibility among such uses unattainable with traditional municipal zoning techniques planned unit development provides flexibility in the regulation of land use development in order to a encourage innovation in land use variety and design in the layout and type of new structures and in their integration with existing structures  b enhance efficiency in the use of land natural resources energy community services and utilities  c encourage open space preservation and protection of natural resources historic sites and structures  d facilitate the provision of housing and improved residential environments  andor e enhance the ability of the village to promote business and employment opportunities the procedures herein established are intended to substitute procedural protections and substantive regulations in recognition of the fact that traditional density bulk spacing and use regulations which are useful in the majority of instances may impose inappropriate preregulations and rigidities upon the development or redevelopment of parcels or areas which lend themselves to an individual planned approach b authority the village zoning map may be amended from time to time by local law duly enacted by the village board of trustees to provide for
