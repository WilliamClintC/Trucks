adopted 3232015 by ll no 32015  621 title this article shall be known as the schenectady best value contract award law  622 intent and purpose a the state legislature and the governor approved legislation that amended  103 of the new york state general municipal law to provide municipalities with greater flexibility in awarding contracts by authorizing the award of purchase contracts on the basis of best value the state legislation requires counties with a population of less than 1000000 to pass a local law authorizing the use of the best value award process b enactment of this legislation provides additional procurement options to localities in ways that may expedite the procurement process and result in cost savings the best value standard for selecting goods is critical to efforts to use strategic sourcing principles to modernize the supply chain and ensure that taxpayers obtain the highest quality goods at the lowest potential cost while also ensuring fairness to all competitors the federal government approximately half of the states and many localities have added best value selection processes to their procurement options in recognition of these advantages with the increased complexity of the goods that municipalities must obtain in order to serve taxpayers it is critical to consider selection and evaluation criteria that measure factors other than cost c taxpayers are not well served when a public procurement results in low unit costs at the outset but ultimately engenders cost escalations due to factors such as inferior quality poor reliability and difficulty of maintenance best value procurement links the procurement process directly to the municipalitys performance requirements incorporating selection factors such as useful lifespan quality and options and incentives for moretimely performance even if the initial expenditure is higher considering the total value over the life of the procurement may result in a better value and longterm investment of public funds d best value procurement also encourages competition and in turn often results in better pricing quality and customer service fostering healthy competition ensures that bidders will continue to strive for excellence in identifying and meeting the needs of municipalities including such important goals as the participation of small minority and womenowned businesses and the development of environmentally preferable goods and service delivery methods  621 charter and related legislation  622 c189  623 award based on lowest bidder or best value the city of schenectady may award purchase contracts that have been procured pursuant to competitive bidding under  103 of the new york state general municipal law by either lowest responsible bidder or best value  624 definitions as used in this article the following terms shall have the meanings indicated best value  the basis for awarding contracts for goods to the offerer which optimizes quality cost and efficiency among responsive and responsible offerers such basis shall reflect wherever possible objective and quantifiable analysis such basis may also identify a quantitative factor for offerers that are small businesses or certified minority or womenowned business enterprises as defined in subdivisions 1 7 15 and 20 of  310 of the executive law to be used in evaluation of offers for awarding of contracts for services  625 requirements e best value procurement will provide muchneeded flexibility in obtaining important goods at favorable prices and will reduce the time to procure such goods a goods procured and awarded on the basis of best value are those that are determined to be of the highest quality while being the most costefficient the determination of quality and costefficiency shall be based on objectively quantified and clearly described and documented criteria which may include but shall not be limited to any or all of the following cost of maintenance proximity to the end user if distance or response time is a significant term durability availability of replacement parts or maintenance contractors longer product life product performance criteria and quality of craftsmanship whenever any contract is awarded on the basis of best value instead of lowest responsible bidder the basis for determining best value shall be thoroughly and accurately documented b upon awarding a contract on the basis of best value the city must be prepared to show that the offeror is responsive and responsible and that objective and quantifiable standards were applied whenever possible to determine that the offer optimizes quality cost and efficiency c the city of schenectady should have a written justification if it bases a best value award on criteria that are not objective and quantifiable  622 schenectady code  626 c190  626 severability if any clause sentence paragraph subdivision section or part of this article or the application thereof to any person

of schenectady new york this article will also promote the public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction use and maintenance of any land development activity as it relates to erosion and sedimentation control and stormwater management this article seeks to meet these purposes by achieving the following objectives a uncontrolled drainage and runoff associated with land development has a significant impact upon the health safety and welfare of the community b eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the silting of streams lakes and other water bodies adversely affecting aquatic life c stormwater runoff and sediment transports pollutants such as heavy metals hydrocarbons nutrients and bacteria to water resources degrading water quality d eroded soil necessitates repair and accelerates the maintenance needs of stormwater management facilities e clearing grading and altering natural topography during construction tends to increase erosion f improper design and construction of drainage facilities can increase the velocity of runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation g impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff and allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow h improperly managed stormwater runoff can increase the incidence of flooding and the severity of floods that occur endangering property and human life i substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts j
