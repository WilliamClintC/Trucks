runoff associated with construction and postconstruction activities  5230 introduction and purpose aduring the construction process soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other species eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of lakes in addition clearing and grading during construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat following the completion of construction activities dust dirt and erosion will continue to affect the stormwater facilities and receiving streams unless postconstruction practices are put in place during the construction and maintained in perpetuity bas a result the purpose of this subchapter is to safeguard persons protect property and prevent damage to the environment in the city of noblesville the city this subchapter will also promote the public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction use and maintenance of any development or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth

development standards variance may be approved only upon a determination in writing that athe approval will not be injurious to the public health safety morals and general welfare of the community  bthe use arid value of the area adjacent to the property included in the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner  and cthe strict application of the terms of the zoning ordinance will result in practical difficulties in the use of the property 2in addition to the findings of fact the board should consider the following factors when deliberating over a variance request ahardship no variance shall be granted pursuant to this unless the applicant shall establish that carrying out the strict letter of the provisions of this chapter would create a particular hardship or practical difficulty the hardship in the fh zoning district must be exceptional unusual and peculiar to the property involved mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional inconvenience aesthetic considerations physical handicaps personal preferences or disagreement with the neighbors also does not qualify as an exceptional hardship as they can be resolved means without granting a variance even if the alternative is more expensive the need for a property owner to build elsewhere or put the property to a different use than originally intended does not constitute a hardship bunique physical condition the subject lot is exceptional as compared to other lots subject to the same provision by reason of a unique physical condition including presence of an existing use structure or sign whether conforming or nonconforming  irregular or substandard shape or size  exceptional topographical features  or other extraordinary physical conditions peculiar to and inherent in the subject lot that amount to more than a mere inconvenience to the owner and that relate to or arise out of the lot rather than the personal situation of the current owner of the lot cnot selfcreated the aforesaid unique physical condition is not the result of any action or inaction of the owner or its predecessors in title and existed at the time of the enactment of the provisions from which a variance is sought or was created by natural forces or was the result of governmental action other than the adoption of this chapter ddenied substantial rights the carrying out of the strict letter of the provision from which variance is sought would deprive the owner of the subject lot of substantial rights commonly enjoyed by owners of other lots subject to the same provision enot merely special privilege the alleged hardship or difficulty is neither merely the inability of the owner or occupant to enjoy some special privilege or additional right not available to owners or occupants of other lots subject to the same provision nor merely the inability of the owner to make more money from the use of the subject lot fplan purposes the variance would not result in a use or development of the subject lot that would not be in harmony with the general and specific purposes for which this chapter and the provision from which a variance is sought were enacted or the general purpose and intent of the comprehensive plan gno other remedy there is no means other than the requested variance by which the alleged hardship or difficulty can be avoided or remedied to a degree sufficient to permit a reasonable use of the subject lot hminimum required the requested variance is the minimum measure of relief necessary to alleviate the alleged hardship or difficulty presented by the strict application of the ordinance badditional considerations for flood hazard areas the board of zoning appeals shall in weighing the appropriateness of a variance for flood hazard areas consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors all standards specified in other sections of this chapter as well as the following 1the danger to life and property due to flooding or

development and the technical advisory committee have been met a land use variance may be approved only upon a determination in writing that 1the approval will not be injurious to the public health safety morals and general welfare of the community  2the use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner  3the need for the variances arises from some condition peculiar to the property involved  4the strict application of the terms of the zoning ordinance will constitute an unnecessary hardship if applied to the property for which the variance is sought  and 5the approval does not interfere substantially with the comprehensive plan fsupplemental requirements for variances in flood hazard areas 1variances shall only be issued for properties located within the flood hazard zoning district when there is aa showing of good and sufficient cause ba determination of failure to grant the variance would result

planned development fehipd district cinterpretation of district sequence 1general rule this chapter rejects as outdated and inappropriate the concept of hierarchical and cumulative zoning districts and except as noted below is based on the concept that each district should be designed to accomplish a specific purpose to encourage a particular type of development and to protect that development from being encroached upon by incompatible types of development 2special rule within the foregoing philosophy however it is recognized that when different districts are juxtaposed their differing characters may require special treatment to ameliorate incompatibilities that might otherwise result for this limited purpose this chapter recognized the concept of more restrictive and less restrictive districts and the districts established by this chapter shall be considered more restrictive or less restrictive in accordance with the following rules athe residential districts shall be deemed more restrictive than any nonresidential district bthe sr district shall be deemed to be the most restrictive residential district and the r5 district shall be deemed to be the least restrictive residential district and the residential districts shall be deemed to become less restrictive as the district number increases cthe commercial industrial and special districts shall be deemed to be equally restrictive drules for interpretation of district boundaries where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of districts as shown on the official zoning map the following rules shall apply 1boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of thoroughfares or highways street lines or highway rightofway lines or alleys shall be construed to follow such center lines 2boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines 3boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be construed as following such city limits 4boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to be midway between the main tracks 5boundaries indicated as following shore lines shall be construed to follow such shore lines  and in the event of change in the shoreline shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline 6boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streams rivers canals lakes or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such center lines provided however when streams meander from the stream bed as it existed on the effective date of this chapter the boundaries shall be construed as following the original stream bed except for floodplain boundaries which are somewhat dependent on streams for their definition 7boundaries indicated as approximately following flood plain lines shall be construed to follow such contour lines in addition to the boundaries shown on the zone maps the flood plain boundaries of minor ditches and streams may be designated as being 100 feet either side of the edge of the water at mean elevation or the outer edges of a horizontal plane established at an elevation of five feet above the mean water level whichever is the greater distance in this case the stream or ditch shall be designated as one which flows at least 180 days of the year 8boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in divisions d1 thorugh 7 of this section shall be so controlled distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the scale of the map 9where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown as the official zoning map or in other circumstances not covered by divisions d1 6 of this section the board of zoning appeals shall interpret the boundaries 10where a district boundary line divides a lot which was in single ownership at the time of passage of this chapter the board of zoning appeals may permit as a special exception the extension of the regulations for either portion of the lot not to exceed 50 feet beyond the district line into the remaining portion of the lot eannexed land all

lots by recognizing two distinct conditions the first condition is where parking lots are located within front and corner side yards where a uniform scheme of landscaping is required to protect the aesthetics along public streets the second condition is where parking lots are located within rear and interior side yards and minimum requirements for beautification of both residential and nonresidential uses are desired the intent is to require a higher level of landscaping abutting or adjacent to residential uses principally multifamily uses than for nonresidential uses it should be

pavement design requirements overview 20design 30subgrade 40mix design 50pavement design 60drainage and detention design 70site design 80construction 10overview pervious or porous concrete pavements permit the percolation of water in the pavement structure to the subgrade which may reduce storm water runoff and pollutants carried during its transportation and dispersion in an attempt to provide a cost effective alternative to conventional storm water detention methods while reducing the impact caused by additional development the city of noblesville has developed minimum standard requirements for pervious concrete pavement the premise of these standards is to 1establish minimum performance criteria for the pavement structure in a manner consistent with other pavements that are currently permitted by city standards 2establish reasonable compliance with the citys stormwater while observing traditional engineering practice the city of noblesvilles ordinances  and 3to utilize design and quality control measures recommended by the concrete industry for pervious concrete the following requirements and standards shall be considered as a supplement to the city of noblesville stormwater technical standards manual which are incorporated by reference herein these standards shall also reference and incorporate the subject matter in the city of noblesvilles unified development involve projects which propose to utilize this design standard these standards shall be observed applied and demonstrated to obtain final approval for an improvement location permit and the use of pervious concrete pavement the purpose of using pervious concrete pavements shall not be to circumvent the requirement of detention or the need to save design costs the concrete industry recognizes that pervious pavements are sensitive to insitu conditions and require unique design consideration and expertise in their use these standards were developed from several resources and incorporate their findings and recommendations the placement of pervious concrete pavement and its use in a manner similar to conventional paving materials is not acceptable as it does not perform in a similar manner 20design design and approval of any pavements utilizing pervious concrete shall follow the requirements of these standards and be subject to the city of noblesvilles stormwater technical standards manual the city of noblesvilles construction standards and the unified development latest editions pervious concrete is not a traditional pavement structure and may not be readily and simply substituted for regularly used hotmixed asphalt hma or customary indot standard concrete mixture without addressing the city of noblesvilles stormwater detention requirements the structure of pervious concrete pavement is designed to function as both an outlet for stormwater runoff and a surface to transport and store vehicular traffic the design standards outlined for pervious concrete pavements outlined herein were developed using information theory methodology and guidelines established and published by the portland cement association the national concrete pavement technology center the national readymixed concrete association the north carolina state universitys department of biological and agricultural engineering and iowa state universitys center for transportation research and education 30subgrade the subgrade for proposed pervious concrete pavement serves two purposes it must be pervious to permit the percolation of water into the earth so it may dissipate an acceptable release rate without adversely affecting surrounding offsite areas while addressing the citys design criteria for the storage of runoff the subgrade must also be stable enough to adequately support the load from the pavement and applied traffic percolation tests shall be procured by the developer designer to determine the suitability of the soil to percolate runoff from the pavement course the number of tests for the site shall be determined by its overall size with tests at two evenlyspaced location sites of 10000 square feet or less sites exceeding 10000 square feet in size shall submit a percolation plan and report for subsurface soils according to the following table  site area sf number of percolation test locations 10000 2 10000 to 15000 3 every 5000 square feet increment exceeding 15000 sf 1 per 5000 square feet of additional area  a sampling plan shall be provided to the city of noblesville for approval prior to the completion of the test in general test locations shall be evenly spaced and near the middle half or third of the proposed pavement area the city of noblesville reserves the opportunity to request any modifications or additions to any proposed sampling plan based on the conditions shape size and use of the lot this is not to infer that sampling plans will be expanded it is conceivable that fewer test spots could be needed depending on the case and situation using the results of the percolation test the designer shall determine the average infiltration rate in inches per hour inhr for the site calculations and the results of the field investigation for the determination of the average infiltration rate shall be submitted with the proposed site plan for review  40mix design for each project a mix design shall be submitted for
