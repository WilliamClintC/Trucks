transmitted by sexual acts   grafton code   1 13 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 14 numerous studies and

this chapter is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children in grafton from the risk that certain convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations close to their

offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault given the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders and that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of reoffense there is a need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law near schools and daycare centers the village finds and declares that in addition to schools and daycare centers children congregate or play at public parks swimming pools libraries recreational trails athletic fields and playgrounds   definitions the

preparation and implementation of comprehensive systemslevel stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units such as watersheds on a municipal and regional scale such plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices practices or systems any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under  28116 wis stats for regional stormwater management measures and have been approved by the village board it is the intent of this chapter that the approved
