sell is entered into or some person other than the owner who claimed the deferral or other than a surviving spouse of such owner who elects to continue the deferral becomes the owner of the property the surviving spouse may elect to continue the property in its deferred status if the election is filed in the same manner as a claim for deferral is filed under subsection b of this section within six months of the death of the spouse who claimed the deferral thereupon the property with respect to which the deferral is claimed shall continue to be subject to special assessment deferral 2when any sale contract to sell or any other transfer occurs and a surviving spouse does not elect to continue the deferral the amounts of deferred special assessment for local improvement including accrued interest shall be due and payable on the sale or transfer of the property 3when subsequent approval of a development order occurs as in the case of a site plan for multifamily development or approval

wastes charges shall be made for fiveday 20degree celsius bod in excess of 300 milligrams per liter and suspended solids in excess of 350 milligrams per liter if the entire water supply causing industrial waste is separated from the water supply for domestic sewage or waters not discharged to a sewer the industrial waste charge shall be based upon the metered volume of water used for the commercial or industrial occupancy separated from the domestic sewage and nonwastewater if the industrial waste is not separately supplied or separately metered then the industrial waste charge shall be based upon either the metered volume of water used from public andor private water supplies or the measured volume of total sewage with appropriate allowances for the volume of domestic sewage at permissible limits of strength and allowance for other waters not discharged to the sewer the domestic sewage allowance shall be based on 1000 cubic feet per month for each nine employees using the

from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads including the effects of buoyancy hydrostatic loads and the effects of buoyancy usually can be addressed required flood openings stated in subsection b of this section because of hydrodynamic loads crawlspace construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than five feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional such as a registered architect or professional engineer other types of foundations are recommended for these areas bthe crawlspace is an enclosed area below the base flood elevation bfe and as such must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters the bottom of each flood vent opening can be no more than one foot above the lowest adjacent exterior grade cportions of the building below the bfe must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage this includes not only the foundation walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building but also any joists insulation or other materials that extend below the bfe the recommended construction practice is to elevate the bottom of joists and all insulation at or above bfe dany building utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated at or above bfe or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions ductwork in particular must either be placed at or above the bfe or sealed from floodwaters ethe interior grade of a crawlspace below the bfe must not be more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade fthe height of the belowgrade crawlspace measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall must not exceed four feet at any point the height limitation is the maximum allowable unsupported wall height according to the engineering analyses and building code requirements for flood hazard areas gan adequate drainage system must be in place to remove floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace within a reasonable time after a flood event the type of drainage system will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage characteristics such as soil types possible options include natural drainage welldrained soils and drainage systems such as perforated pipes drainage tiles or gravel or crushed stone drainage by gravity or mechanical means hthe velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five feet per second for any crawlspace for velocities in excess of five feet per second other foundation types should be used   exh a regulations by location  before the regulatory floodway in areas where a regulatory floodway has not been designated no new construction substantial improvements or other

established to provide for the integration of residential commercial and recreational uses in a wellplanned pedestrianoriented mixed use environment the purpose of the district is to provide maximum flexibility in land use while protecting the unique character of nelscott where a proposed development meets the design requirements of this chapter the land use approvals process should be as predictable and efficient as possible while striving for excellence in design the npd land use and design standards in articles ii and iii are intended to ensure that projects support the following objectives integration and functionality of land uses  connecting nelscott to the ocean  respecting neighborhood transitions  designing for the climate  aesthetics and contextsensitive design  balancing durability and affordability aintegration and functionality of land uses connections between building entrances sidewalks and associated pedestrian areas should be made to encourage visual and physical integration with a strong sense of place due to the small parcel sizes and limited rightofway widths within nelscott developments should maximize the opportunity to consolidate and share parking for example by sharing driveways where such connections are not practicable site plans should maximize the opportunity to provide shared parking serving multiple developments bconnecting nelscott to the ocean nelscott has a network of eastwest streets and alleys providing visual and in some cases physical access to the beach the area is defined by villagescale storefronts beach cottages and hotels nestled between rolling hills shore pines and the ocean while the city recognizes that it is not possible or practical to preserve all views of the ocean new projects should be designed to take advantage of ocean views while maintaining view corridors from adjacent rightsofway and pedestrian spaces to the greatest extent practicable crespecting neighborhood transitions developments on the edge of the nelscott plan district should be made compatible with abutting singlefamily residential uses outside the plan district  particularly the singlefamily dwellings and cottages to the north the design standards for nelscott are intended to address compatibility mass scale materials detailing setbacks and other elements ddesigning for the climate temperatures in lincoln city vary widely and it can rain any day of the year people like being outside and will often walk from place to place even when its raining nelscott has many visitors in the summer and more people are making it their home or second home therefore buildings should be designed to withstand high winds as storms can generate winds of 100 miles per hour rooflines should not be overly complex and should have proper drainage for rainwater roofs should shed and drain water away from building openings parking refuse storage areas and other such areas commercial buildings should incorporate canopies awnings porticos or similar weather protection features pedestrian amenities such as plazas and outdoor seating areas should take advantage of southern exposures and be protected from the wind to the greatest extent practical esustainability in order to reduce the environmental and energy effects of development sustainable building practices are encouraged permeable pavements for driveways walkways and parking areas are encouraged as is energy conservation in construction site designs should maximize the preservation of existing mature vegetation and should provide for onsite storm water quality treatment and management such as bioswales or other natural water treatment features faesthetics and contextsensitive design nelscotts aesthetic is rooted in the areas eclectic mix of beach cottages hotels and the nelscott strip nestled between rolling hills shore pines and the ocean the nelscott plan district encourages new development and redevelopment that honors the past while providing a contemporary interpretation of the areas architecture and history the predominant building materials are painted or naturalstain wood siding shingle lap or boardandbatten masonry block brick and stone detailing may include any of these materials as well as limited use of metal or vinyl for canopies building detailing eg flashing roof gutters drains etc signs art and other detailing while each project is unique the nelscott design standards  are intended to provide clear and consistent standards the standards discourage overly thematic formula architecture or designs used by retailers national chain stores franchises and other companies with stores or offices in multiple locations  provided that corporate logos art and similar commercial speech are not restricted gbalancing durability and affordability balancing durability and affordability means that the city is practical in administering its codes great design does not have to be expensive sound design principles quality workmanship longlasting materials and routine maintenance are all important historically development in nelscott has been characterized by relatively simple building forms with moderate detailing and ornamentation traditional materials such as wood stone and brick are preferred but other materials such as architecturalgrade composite boards shingles and trim may be used when it is demonstrated that the material is durable and fits the overall composition of the proposed design project designs should respect the past while being practical and durable for the future 1a  nelscott district overlay zones the np district consists of three subdistricts as shown on the zoning map in exhibit a attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter anelscott business district nbd the intent of this zoning subdistrict is to encourage and enhance the traditional character of the nelscott commercial core along highway 101 and to concentrate the businesses in a pedestrianfriendly manner the emphasis in this subdistrict is on providing retail commercial and personal services for the neighboring residents and visitors bnelscott cottage residential ncr the intent of this zoning subdistrict is to encourage and enhance the traditional character of the nelscott residential areas located west of highway 101 the emphasis in this subdistrict is on preserving and protecting the traditional cottage heritage in a familyfriendly pedestrianoriented environment cnelscott beachside mixed use nbmu the intent of this zoning subdistrict is to provide for a variety of smallscale beachoriented commercial and residential uses in a familyfriendly environment 1b  applicability of municipal code regulations aapplicability the provisions of the nelscott plan district in addition to all other applicable regulations of this title and other city ordinances shall apply to all uses of land and development within the np district bredevelopment and remodels where an existing use or development is proposed to be modified or exterior remodeling the standards shall apply only to that portion of the use or development that is to be modified  where more than 50 percent of the use or development is to be modified the reviewing body may require the entire development to conform to the provisions of this chapter as provided in subsection e of this section cburden of proof the applicant has the burden of proof of demonstrating conformity with the standards and criteria of this chapter dwhere conflicts occur between this chapter and other lincoln city municipal the provisions of this chapter shall apply enonconforming situations existing uses andor developments that do not conform to the provisions of this chapter but were established lawfully prior to the city adopting this chapter shall be allowed to continue as provided in lcmc nonconforming situations except however that a nonconforming residence that is destroyed by any cause to an extent exceeding 50 percent of the appraised value as determined by the records of the county assessor for the year preceding destruction may be rebuilt within the same footprint to the extent any such rebuilt residence is expanded including a vertical expansion the area of expansion must conform to the np regulations 1c  administration of design standards asite plan review the design standards will be applied to commercial development including mixed use and multifamily dwellings but not including singlefamily or twofamily dwellings that must receive approval citys site plan review process during that process and prior to issuance of building permits singlefamily or twofamily dwellings are subject to the design standards requirements relating to block layout and must receive approval building permit review process the planning director may refer any site plan review application to the planning commission for a public hearing when 1the applicant has requested an adjustment or modification to one or more nelscott code standards as provided in subsection c of this section  or 2the applicant requests a hearing  or 3the planning director determines that the size or scale of the development relative to its appearance traffic generation parking or other characteristics warrants a public hearing bdesign standards versus guidelines the code sections that follow provide intent statements followed by standards and guidelines most sections contain objective standards and approval criteria  however some criteria require the reviewing body to apply discretion where discretion is involved the code provides guidelines to assist the reviewing body in evaluating a proposal the following further explains the relationship between intent statements standards and guidelines 1intent statements are not applicable approval criteria except requests for adjustments or variance must demonstrate how the proposal conforms to the codes intent 2standards use the words shall or must and are mandatory 3guidelines use the words should may preferred and discouraged and are advisory guidelines supplement the standards and provide examples of acceptable or unacceptable design guidelines also assist in reviewing requests for adjustments and variances and may serve as the basis for approval denial or approval with modifications in such instances 4graphics are used to illustrate standards and guidelines they are not intended to prescribe a particular design but serve as examples of acceptable or unacceptable design solutions 5standards and guidelines both serve as approval criteria but the reviewing body is afforded greater latitude in applying guidelines where the word should is used the applicant must demonstrate that the proposal is consistent with the guideline or that applying an alternate design solution is consistent with the codes stated intent where a guideline conflicts with any code standard the standard shall prevail 6in the case of a proposed variance or adjustment to a code standard the applicant must demonstrate how the variance or adjustment results in equal or greater conformity to the intent of the code and all other applicable standards and guidelines 7nullification of one standard or guideline by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not cause any other standard or guideline to be nullified cadjustmentsmodifications to the standards the standards contained in this chapter may be adjusted or modified without the need for a variance if the applicant demonstrates that 1the chapters guiding principles and the intent statements under the applicable standard to be adjusted can be better met proposed alternative design solution  or 2there are practical difficulties in meeting a standard based on the necessary characteristics of an allowed use in such cases the design must provide other features that tend to meet the goal of the standard such as a trellis with vines a sculpture or a pergola where the code language suggests more than one way to meet a particular standard the applicant is encouraged to be creative and propose the most appropriate design solution given the sites context and the purpose of the code the decisionmaking body shall refer to the guiding principles in lcmc  the purpose in lcmc  and the intent under each standard in making its decision  the purpose guiding principles and intent statements shall serve as the approval criteria for adjustments dincentives for design excellence the city encourages excellence in design projects that provide superior pedestrian spaces pedestrian amenities public art alleys shared parking or superior architecture may be rewarded for example with reduced offstreet parking requirements reduced lot sizes increased allowable building coverage andor assistance from the citys urban renewal program these incentives are in addition to the adjustments provided in subsection c of this section in granting incentives the hearing body shall find that the incentive results in a design that is superior to what is required under the base standards and is consistent with one or more of the following guidelines 1integration and functionality of land uses mixed use projects combining upperstory residential uses with ground floor commercial or civic uses are preferred over singleuse developments in the nbd and nbmu subdistricts 2connecting nelscott to the ocean oceanfront projects that provide the public with physical beach access are preferred over those that provide only visual access or no access at all nonoceanfront projects should maintain views of the ocean from public rightsofway where such views currently exist where a project results in diminished ocean views the decision body may consider other mitigating circumstances in approving an incentive such as the provision of pedestrian spaces eg plaza or public parking facilities in the vicinity that enable the public to more easily access the shoreline 3respecting neighborhood transitions where an applicant requests an exception to the maximum building height standards abutting a residential zone the project must incorporate mitigating design features such as additional open space or buffering adjacent to residential uses applicants are encouraged to do neighborhood outreach prior to submitting site plans to the city for review the applicants efforts to engage the public eg design charrette prior to submitting a site plan application may influence the decision body in approving or denying incentives 4designing for the climate design elements that show special attention to the nelscott climate such as innovative rain protection features wind protection features and solar exposure features are encouraged projects going beyond basic wind and rain protection and taking advantage of solar exposure are preferred over projects that do not 5sustainability incentives may be appropriate for projects incorporating green building practices such as the preservation of existing mature vegetation use of water quality treatment in parking lots rooftops and landscapes use of renewable energy and energy conservation in construction projects eligible for green certification nationally recognized program eg leadership through energy and environmental design leed or similar program approved by the city are preferred over those that do not meet such criteria 6aesthetics and contextsensitive design architecture that goes beyond base code requirements and achieves the vision contained in the nelscott redevelopment plan is preferred over architecture that merely conforms to the base code requirements for example corner properties along highway 101 particularly those in gateway locations should incorporate a tower or other signature architectural feature oceanfront designs should be superior in both their streetfronting elevation as well as their oceanfronting elevation 7balancing durability and affordability in granting incentives preference may be given to projects providing affordable workforce housing or affordable commercial space to small businesses except overnight accommodations affordable housing means households earning less than the area median income pay no more than 30 percent of their income toward housing costs where incentives are provided the reviewing authority may require the applicantowner to record deed restrictions or provide other assurances that the subject housing remains affordable for not less than 10 years   1d nelscott land use standards  permitted

preexisting lots smaller than 3000 square feet the maximum building coverage is 50 percent   2b nelscott design standards  purpose the nelscott design standards are intended to implement the vision for nelscott specifically to help ensure that new buildings and rehabilitated existing buildings convey an image consistent with local history and the oregon coastal environment the standards reflect the following values and objectives retain nelscotts compact walkable character and the traditional smallscale commercial development in the highway 101 commercial area  promote the formation of pedestrianfriendly facilities and structures  encourage architectural variety consistent with the eclectic character of nelscott  provided that new development creates a close intimate human scale and architectural design addresses all four sides of a building  encourage the use of contextually appropriate materials textures and colors  create vibrant pedestrian spaces eg plazas public art cafe seating areas etc  pedestrian spaces should help identify nelscott create intrigue and offer weather protection and comfort to pedestrians while adding value to the district  break down large building masses and provide visual interest along the street  balance rhythm and continuity  encourage creativity in the design of building elevations rooflines and facade elements  retain the smallscale beach cottage character of the interior residential area 3a  block layout aintent new development and redevelopment projects should reinforce the historic street grid of nelscott commercial and mixed use buildings should be placed at or near the sidewalk edge and parking should be set back behind or beside such buildings parking should be provided onstreet where shoulders are approved to accommodate parking spaces or bays by maintaining the integrity of nelscotts historic form land is used efficiently traffic is distributed evenly and new development contributes to a cohesive pedestrianfriendly district bstandards 1rightsofway anew development and redevelopment projects that are projected to generate additional vehicle andor pedestrian traffic may be required to dedicate rightsofway andor improve abutting streets and walkways bstreet and walkway rightofway shall not be vacated except where it is demonstrated that the development will improve the pedestrian environment 2street access anew vehicle access to highway 101 is discouraged access to highway 101 and connecting streets is subject to the provisions of lincoln city highway access standards the city or odot may require vehicle access be provided from side streets and existing highway approaches be consolidated as a condition of development approval bthe alignment of streets and walkways shall be maintained in new development to ensure connectivity from block to block the city may require the extension and improvement of a walkway as a condition of development approval walkway extensions shall be 10 to 20 feet in width consistent with the existing width of the walkway subject to site plan review cwalkways shall be contained in a public rightofway or public access easement improved to city standards 3buildings abutting interior parking areas where a block is planned to contain an interior parking area ie served by an alley or shared access drive buildings abutting the parking area shall provide entrances opening onto it or be connected to the street by a continuous pedestrian walkway eg between buildings buildings and development shall not be configured in a way that precludes public access to such public parking facilities see also lcmc   3b  buildings and structures asinglefamily dwellings and duplexes 1intent the guidelines for singlefamily dwellings and duplexes are intended to help ensure that new buildings and rehabilitated dwellings convey an image consistent with local history and the oregon coastal environment clear and basic building forms and quality design details are preferred 2incentives aaccessory dwelling units a dwelling that complies with at least four of the five guidelines below is eligible for an accessory dwelling unit bbuilding coverage a dwelling that complies with at least four of the five guidelines below is eligible for increased building coverage of 10 percent for example if a dwelling would be allowed 35 percent building coverage without compliance with compliance it would be entitled to 45 percent building coverage 3guidelines aroofs roofs should be pitched not flat and should include dormers gables and eave trim that enrich the visual quality of the community high quality architectural embellishments are encouraged bfacades the facades are the fronts of the dwellings and convey the relationship of the building to the street and neighborhood they include windows doors shutters awnings molding porches steps stoops and other design elements arranged to convey the character of the building one to twostory homes are encouraged porches are common in nelscott and should be provided unless the configuration of the lot precludes it highquality exterior woodwork and attention to detail elements is encouraged garage entrances should not be a part of the primary building facade cchimneys in nelscott many buildings include unique chimneys of varying shapes that are sheathed with a range of materials including stone brick and wood shingles dwellings should include chimneys as design elements dtexture and materials in nelscott many homes use textures and materials that relate to elements of the local natural environment such as river rock chimneys wood shingled siding brick and exposed aggregate paving dwellings should make use of highquality natural materials and should be sided with historic wood materials such as shingles clapboard bevel siding or boardandbatten foundations should be faced with rock elandscape materials these include trees shrubs grasses fences walls outdoor lighting walkways and other hard surface gathering areas landscape materials add value to homes by enhancing the outdoor space and relate to the architecture of the building and surrounding areas river rock and quarry stone are equally suitable for walls in nelscott landscape materials should predominately incorporate native materials such as wood and rock and hardy native plantings the front yard should consist primarily of landscaping and should not be dominated by paved parking areas bmultifamily dwellings and commercial buildings in the business district and beachside mixed use district 1intent the nelscott strip the eclectic group of buildings existing along highway 101 is an iconic element of nelscotts image commercial development and redevelopment along the highway should continue the pattern established in the existing nelscott strip therefore building design standards for the business district draw on the design elements characterizing the strip while allowing for design variety in the beachside mixed use area the building design standards draw on the cottagescale development that exists there now it is not the citys intent to create an architectural theme or to freeze time the design standards are not meant to halt progress or restrict property rights but rather to ensure that new buildings and remodels fit within the context of their surroundings and support a compact pedestrianoriented district in this way the city can ensure that nelscott retains its sense of place vitality and economic base the key elements of the building design standards are eclectic coastal architecture including commercial and mixed use development  building height and articulated facades that create a sense of street enclosure at a human scale  contextually appropriate materials textures and colors  storefront character windows pedestrian shelter furnishings etc  adaptable building styles that comfortably accommodate commercial and mixed land uses  a diversity of building facades and rooflines that fall into a consistent rhythm  corner lots as focal points with vertical elements furnishings and public art 2standards aheight the maximum allowable height is 45 feet in the nelscott business district and 35 feet in the nelscott beachside mixed use district except that in the nelscott beachside mixed use district buildings in existence on  that exceed a height of 35 feet shall continue to be considered conforming and may be rebuilt if destroyed by any cause to an extent exceeding 50 percent of the appraised value expansions of such buildings must conform to the 35foot height limit chimneys spires towers and other architectural projections exceeding the allowed height may be allowed plan review to the extent they are permitted building stories and projections exceeding 35 feet in height must be recessed behind the next lower building stories by not less than 10 feet unless a lesser recess is allowed plan review on the basis of superior architectural design or as described in subsection b2hii of this section bbuilding form ioverall form architectural designs shall address all four sides of a building the predominant form abutting highway 101 is a generally flat elevation on the lowest story with any recesses or projections articulations appearing subordinate to the dominant rectangular form upper stories generally are accommodated within gables and dormers either gable or shed new buildings should reflect the predominant form while expressing individuality for example with vertical elements such as cupolas turrets or towers on corner properties new buildings should not mimic any other building in their form or detailing iistepped rooflines height shall vary from building to building to avoid a homogeneous appearance this standard is met by using either stepped rooflines or slightly dissimilar overall height ie buildingtobuilding abrupt changes in height between buildings can be managed by having the taller building follow the horizontal lines of the shorter building along the first two floors and reference elements or detailing of the shorter buildings on its upper stories see also subsection b2c of this section iiiroof form sidefacing gable roofs are the predominant roof form in the highway 101 area usually incorporating frontfacing dormers and this form shall be followed on new buildings shed roofs sloping to the rear are allowed as well mansard roofs including false mansards applied forms without windows are discouraged and aframe buildings and other nontraditional nelscott forms are prohibited cstorefront

adequate sunlight and irrigation to ensure their successful growth   3c  streetscapes aintent the relationship between the local street system highway 101 and adjoining properties is important from both a transportation planning and a land use perspective the oregon department of transportation odot is the permitting authority for all access onto highway 101 as the permitting agency for land use the city works cooperatively with odot to manage development adjacent to the highway the citys design standards are intended to implement the communitys vision of a cohesive streetscape with onstreet parking wide sidewalks weather protection pedestrian shelters benches pedestrianscaled lighting public art opportunities for cafe seating and other amenities a safe inviting and comfortable pedestrian environment benefits businesses highway users and the community as a whole bstandards in addition to standards for block layout alleys and parking lot access provided in lcmc  the following provisions apply to all new development 1transportation plan conformity new development shall conform to the policies standards specifications and design details eg street sections contained in the citys transportation system plan tsp and the requirements of this chapter specifically lcmc  block layout and  pedestrian spaces when streetscape improvements are required of new development such improvements shall conform to the tsp 2local streets lcmc  provides standards for local street improvements 3pedestrian amenities lcmc  provides standards for pedestrian spaces and pedestrian amenities additionally the nelscott redevelopment plan provides specifications for street furnishings such as benches trash receptacles wayfinding signs and streetlights 3d  pedestrian spaces aintent the increased development intensity mixture of uses pedestrian activity close building orientation and minimal private open space envisioned for nelscott require that pedestrian space be provided along building frontages and in breaks between buildings pedestrian spaces such as plazas extrawide sidewalks outdoor seating areas pedestrian access ways between buildings alcoves and pocket parks provide visual relief pedestrian resting areas and opportunities for socialization pedestrian spaces do not have to be publicly owned or maintained public or private they are as important as building design and central parking to the success of nelscott therefore the city requires that all new developments and redevelopment projects contribute their proportionate share of pedestrian space bstandards 1pedestrian space standard at least three percent of every development site except for residential developments but including mixed use developments shall be designated and improved as pedestrian space the highest priority locations for pedestrian space are those areas with the highest pedestrian activity eg street corners and midblock pedestrian access ways that have a western or southern exposure within 45 degrees of true south or west where no such area exists then pedestrian space should be provided as an extended sidewalk or walkway connecting multiple developments 2dimensions all pedestrian spaces shall have dimensions of not less than eight feet across and have a surface area of not less than 64 square feet 3public access such areas shall abut a public rightofway or otherwise be connected to and visible from a public rightofway by a sidewalk or pedestrian access way  access ways shall be identifiable with a change in paving materials eg pavers inlaid in concrete or a change in pavement scoring patterns andor texture where a rightofway connection is not possible the owner shall be required to provide a public access way easement to the pedestrian space pedestrian spaces shall not be gated or closed to public access unless otherwise required by the city 4pedestrian amenities required where pedestrian space is required it shall

areas in an amount equal to or greater than onehalf of one percent of the estimated construction cost of the subject buildings where a pedestrian space adjoins a building entrance it should incorporate a canopy awning pergola portico or similar weather protection feature pedestrian amenities such as seating planters public art and pedestrian lighting eg antique lamps or bollard lights at street corners or pedestrian access ways may be counted in fulfilling the onehalf of one percent percent requirement cost estimates for pedestrian amenity improvements shall be prepared by a licensed architect landscape architect or other qualified professional and shall be subject to review and approval by the administrator 5mechanical equipment and garbage storage areas mechanical equipment and garbage storage areas are not permitted within pedestrian spaces such facilities shall be screened completely from view and set back 20 feet or more from a pedestrian space for aesthetic reasons and

addition to the standards of lcmc and the standards for block layout alleys and parking lot access provided in lcmc  the following provisions apply to all new development 1driveup and drivethrough uses new driveupdriveeg windows atms etc are not permitted where applicable the reviewing authority may approve the relocation and improvement of existing driveup facilities subject to a conditional use permit 2onstreet parking existing or required paved standardsized parking spaces that abut a parcel and that are located in a public street may be counted toward the required parking for commercial development on that parcel for parcels fronting on highway 101 the number of onstreet parking spaces for standardsized vehicles within 200 feet of a parcel may be counted toward the required number of parking spaces for commercial or mixed uses 3offstreet parking there is no minimum offstreet parking requirement for the commercial component of any mixed use building within 400 feet of a public parking facility  all other uses shall conform to the minimum parking standards of the municipal code except that required offstreet parking spaces may be located on another parcel not more than 400 feet from the parcel they are intended to serve where new surface parking is planned it shall be limited to parallel onstreet parking spaces parking bays abutting the street andor parking areas located behind or to the side of a building 4parking lot design surface parking areas shall be divided into bays of not more than 12 parking spaces per bay the minimum dimensions for landscape areas are four feet in width and 24 square feet in area additionally where a parking area or access drive abuts a street or pedestrian access way a landscape screen of not less than four feet in width and four feet in height shall be provided alternatively the screen may be reduced to two feet in width where a masonry wrought iron brick or similar architecturalgrade wall is also provided subject to site plan review landscaping shall be provided in conformance with lcmc  the planning commission may allow a greater number of consecutive parking spaces where the development preserves and protects one or more existing mature trees or exceeds the minimum pedestrian space requirement in lcmc  the commission shall use its discretion in adjusting the standard  provided that more credit may be awarded to projects that preserve the largest or most visible trees as viewed from public rightsofway 5redevelopment of surface parking plans for properties adjacent to cityowned parking lots should allow for conversion of such lots to structured parking in the future site plans should also allow for the conversion of nonconforming front yard parking lots to new building sites or pedestrian spaces as properties redevelop where a proposed project would construct underground parking the review authority may adjust building coverage setbacks or other development standards to facilitate provision of publicprivate parking spaces 6parking in front of buildings due to the pedestrian orientation of nelscott surface parking is not allowed between any new building and the street to which is it oriented where such parking currently exists the owner may be required to install landscaping or other buffering between the parking area and the sidewalk with future redevelopment 7service and loading areas the visual traffic odor and noise impacts of service and loading areas relative to streets pedestrian spaces pedestrian access ways and adjacent residences shall be minimized service areas and loading docksbays shall be accessed from an alley and screened using architectural elements that are compatible with adjacent buildings where no alley exists service areas shall be accessed from streets other than highway 101 8exception for commercial vacation rental dwellings a vacation rental dwelling in the nbmu or nbd subdistricts that a is in a building that existed on  or pursuant to lcmc e replaces with no increase in the number of bedrooms such a building that was destroyed by calamity eg fire flood earthquake and b is on a lot that is too small to accommodate the number of parking spaces required by lcmc  need only provide the number of parking spaces that as determined by the planning and community development director reasonably can be accommodated on the lot   3f  pedestrian access aintent in new development the pedestrian circulation system shall provide a direct convenient and comfortable means of accessing individual uses and connecting to other parts of nelscott the pedestrian system includes sidewalks pathways midblock access ways and the ocean beach bstandards to ensure safe direct and convenient pedestrian circulation all developments shall provide a continuous pedestrian system conforming to city standards 3g  landscaping aintent nelscott is identifiable in part by its shore pines and other coastal vegetation while it is inevitable that some existing trees will be removed with new development native vegetation should be preserved where practicable or otherwise replanted in required landscape areas trees and hedges serve as windbreaks and visual screens in an area that is otherwise being exposed to high winds grassy swales capture and cleanse surface water runoff before it infiltrates into the ground or seeps onto the beach mature vegetation also enhances real estate values for these reasons as well for aesthetic reasons the city requires that all new developments and redevelopment projects attempt to save mature vegetation that is not within building envelopes and provide landscaping in surface parking areas as buffers between uses within street planter strips and to soften the appearance of large building elevations bstandards 1mature landscaping site plans shall incorporate existing mature vegetation that is not within building envelopes and not within areas that are required to be graded or excavated eg for utilities foundations and driveways into the projects landscape design to the greatest extent practicable where mature tree removal is unavoidable eg a trees location precludes reasonable development consistent with prescribed building envelopes required building orientation or public improvement requirements mitigation shall be required as per subsection b3g of this section 2volume landscaping and screening large trees andor shrub planting may be required in quantities exceeding the base requirements of this code to mitigate adjustments to other standards or the loss of mature trees as described under subsection b1 of this section 3minimum landscape standards aall offstreet parking and vehicular use areas including driveways and loading docks shall have perimeter landscaping of not less than four feet in depth and interior landscaping covering at least 10 percent of the entire vehicular use area the planning commission authority may reduce the minimum landscape area to not less than five percent where the development preserves and protects one or more existing mature trees the commission shall use its discretion in awarding credit  provided that more credit may be awarded to projects that preserve the largest or most visible trees as viewed from public rightsofway including the beach areas with preserved trees are counted toward the required parking lot landscaping beach separate landscape area shall be a minimum of 24 square feet with a minimum dimension of at least four feet and shall contain at least one tree all remaining land in the landscape area shall be covered by a combination of shrubs ground cover plants or other cityapproved nonvegetative ground cover call required buffer strips screens and other required landscape areas shall be planted at a density to ensure the intended buffering or screening intent is met  in no case shall a landscape area have less than one tree per 200 square feet of surface or less than one shrub per 50 square feet of area drequired trees and shrubs shall be noninvasive species that are known to thrive in the northern oregon coastal environment ethe following guidelines

paving materials such as pavers set in sand concrete blocks allowing grass to grow or porous concrete eg particularly along walkways and in parking areas that are used infrequently the reviewing authority may allow additional building lot coverage consistent with the standards in table b porous paving may also be used for small areas such as the first four feet of a parking lots perimeter where it would help reduce or slow surface water runoff recommended figure  image image image figure  typical parking lot landscape concepts incorporating water quality features 3h  signs aintent the number size configuration placement color materials and illumination of signs all play a part in shaping the built environment signs in nelscott should function primarily as cues for pedestrian wayfinding and business identification business identification does not require that owners maximize the size or number of signs the highway streetscape has builtin traffic calming features that together with the building design standards will enable motorists and pedestrians to notice signs at a relatively small scale signs designed to a highway scale are not necessary and are discouraged following standards bstandards signs shall not be installed without a sign permit where a sign permit is required as part of a larger project the sign package shall be reviewed with the site plan under the applicable provisions of lcmc and the following guidelines and standards where a sign permit is requested apart from any other development application it shall be processed administratively

awning canopy or similar architectural feature may be approved subject to applicable building codes portable signs shall conform to lcmc c4 3contextual design signs should complement nelscotts natural surroundings for example signs engraved or sculpted from metal or wood natural or painted wood are preferred over those that are predominately made of plastic plexiglas or similar reflective materials pictographic symbols are encouraged as they often communicate more than text and add visual interest to the street fluorescent eg dayglow sparkling reflective or similar colors or finishes are not permitted banner signs streamers moving signs video or animated signs flashing signs and similar sign types are considered a nuisance and traffic safety hazard and are therefore not permitted 4pedestrian signs pedestrianscale signs such as blade signs wood cutout signs door signs and permanent stylized window signs allowing at least 50 percent transparency throughout the window are encouraged such signs are exempt from the overall sign area limitations 5signs for buildings with multiple tenants should be designed to allow for new business names to be added or replaced easily 6illuminated signs when signs are to be illuminated external light sources shall be used light sources shall be placed close to and directed onto the sign they are intended to illuminate and shielded

exterior lighting image image figure  examples of encouraged sign types from top left to right mural blade wood cutout hanging sign   3i  exterior lighting aintent the number size design and placement of lights all contribute to creating a safe and aesthetically pleasing development excessive lighting contributes to light pollution glare and light trespass and it diminishes views of the night sky lights in nelscott should function primarily as tools for pedestrian wayfinding and business visibility business visibility does not require that owners fully illuminate their building and parking areas bstandards outdoor light fixtures shall not be installed without site plan review approval where a light fixture is required as part of a larger project the lighting package shall be reviewed under the following guidelines and standards where an outdoor light fixture is to be installed apart from any other development application it shall be processed administratively outdoor lighting that

commencement of any development on property within the nr overlay zone for purposes of this section development means any construction alteration of landforms or removal of vegetation if the nr overlay zone applies to a portion of a parcel an nrd review is required only for that portion of a development located inside the nr overlay zone no development may take place until the director completes the nrd review and authorizes the development bthe director will review all reports submitted including but not limited to delineations and environmental reviews to determine if the development complies with the requirements of this chapter within 10 days of the filing of the reports the director must prepare a written statement with findings authorizing denying or conditionally approving the development findings must be consistent with the provisions of this chapter the comprehensive plan and statewide planning goals cthe written statement of the director must be published in the next available edition of the newspaper notices of the action must be mailed to all property owners within 250 feet of the exterior boundary of the property where the development is to take place required notices must be mailed by regular first class mail and must be postmarked no later than the date of publication in the newspaper the director also must mail a notice of the action to the following public agencies as appropriate the oregon department of fish and wildlife oregon division of state lands oregon department of land conservation and development us fish and wildlife

the provisions of lcmc for all permitted uses not specified in lcmc  prior to any development occurring within the natural resource overlay zone the planning commission must determine that the variance request meets all the following criteria in addition to those found in lcmc  1strict adherence to the natural resource overlay zone standards would effectively preclude a use of the lot or parcel that reasonably could be expected to occur in the zone and that the property owner would be precluded a substantial property right enjoyed by the majority of the landowners in the vicinity  and 2the variance requested of the possible variances necessary to create a buildable area outside of the natural resource overlay zone has the least impact to the natural resource functions  and 3the proposed development including actions to mitigate impacts to natural resource functions can be accommodated without substantial negative impact to the applicable natural resource functions bdevelopment guidelines variances for proposed development within the natural resource overlay zone will be considered only when the following development guidelines are met 1the yard setback opposite the natural resource area may be reduced by up to onehalf of the standard setback but not to less than three feet 2the allowed reduction must be the minimum necessary to site the proposed use at most exclusions may be reduced to create a buildable area of no more than 1750 square feet   6  existing structures and uses existing structures and uses that are not allowed in the natural resource overlay zone may be continued at the size and intensity at which they were legally established these existing structures and uses may be expanded in area or intensity within the significant natural resource only with approval under lcmc  expansion in size or intensity of structures or uses where the expansion occurs entirely outside of the significant natural resource is allowed to the extent allowed by the underlying zoning     7  lot creation any lot or parcel created must contain sufficient building area outside the natural resource overlay zone to allow for development without requiring reduction of the natural resource area parcels created or modified after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter so as to no longer contain sufficient buildable area outside the natural resource overlay zone to allow for development without requiring reduction of the natural resource area are not eligible for the small lot exclusion reduction or variance provided for in lcmc      8  claims of map error a responsible party may request to be excused from compliance with the requirements of this chapter if the proposed development area was mapped as a significant natural resource in error if the request is approved then the significant natural resources map will be amended to remove the proposed development area from the map in the case of wetlands the claim of map error must be confirmed by the oregon division of state lands   9  plan amendment option esee any owner of property on which development otherwise would be limited by the natural resource overlay zone may apply for a quasijudicial comprehensive plan amendment the amendment must be based on a specific development proposal the effect of the amendment would be to remove the natural resource overlay zone from all or a portion of the property the applicant must demonstrate that an amendment is justified by completing an environmental social economic and energy esee consequences analysis in accordance with oregon department of land conservation and development administrative rules oar 66023040 if the application is approved then the esee analysis will be incorporated by reference into the city comprehensive plan and the significant natural resources map will be amended to remove the significant natural resource overlay zone from the inventory if the application is approved the city at its discretion may impose conditions on any resulting development approval in order to ensure that the development is consistent with the esee analysis the esee analysis must comply with the following requirements athe esee analysis must demonstrate that the adverse economic consequences of not allowing the conflicting use are sufficient to justify the loss or partial loss of the resource bthe esee analysis must demonstrate why the use cannot be located on buildable land outside of the significant natural resource and that no other sites within the city can meet the specific needs of the proposed use cfor resources located within the goal 17 planning area in addition to the above requirements the esee analysis also must address the goal 2 exception process as set

not issue a permit until the city has had an opportunity to determine that such protection complies with the applicable provisions of this chapter including this subsection protective structures must be kept in good repair and are subject to additional compliance standards as well as enforcement under lcmc eprotection project permits shoreland other than ocean beach front protection projects such as groins bulkheads and sea walls may not begin until a permit is obtained from the city no approval to the state or city permit for a shoreland protection project will be issued until the developer has supplied to the city a plan prepared by a certified engineering geologist or by a registered professional engineer qualified to practice geotechnical engineering which indicates the nature and scope of the proposed protective activity nonstructural means of protection that will be effective to control erosion must be the first order of consideration in protecting shorelands the use of structures such as groins bulkheads or sea walls will not be allowed unless nonstructural means cannot protect the property and the adverse consequences created by such structures both erosionrelated and aesthetic will be insignificant fvegetation if vegetation is to be removed because of the development of any protection structure a revegetation plan must be submitted the plan must illustrate how vegetation removal will be minimized to prevent dune form alteration and exposure to erosion the plan must provide for revegetation as extensive as or greater than exists prior to disruption the protection structure will be approved by the state or permitted by the city only if the vegetation removal and the revegetation will be conducted so as to prevent dune form alteration and exposure to erosion resulting from the removal and revegetation ggroundwater no development in ocean beach and dune areas may use existing groundwater sources as a primary domestic water source developments may use existing groundwater sources for limited irrigation purposes after securing all necessary state permits and the submission to and approval by the city of written findings prepared by a certified engineering geologist or by a registered professional engineer qualified to practice geotechnical engineering that the irrigation will not cause groundwater drawdown to levels which would lead to loss

provide for the integration of residential commercial and recreational uses in a wellplanned pedestrianoriented mixed use environment the purpose of the district is to provide maximum flexibility in land use where a proposed development meets the design requirements of this chapter  the land use approvals process should be as predictable and efficient as possible while striving for excellence in design the op land use and design standards in articles ii and iii of this chapter respectively are intended to ensure that projects support the following objectives integration and functionality of land uses connecting oceanlake to the ocean respecting neighborhood transitions designing for the climate aesthetics and contextsensitive design balancing durability and affordability aintegration and functionality of land uses connections between building entrances sidewalks and associated pedestrian areas should be made to encourage visual and physical integration with a strong sense of place due to the small parcel sizes and limited rightofway widths within oceanlake developments should maximize the opportunity to consolidate and share parking for example by extending alleys or shared driveways particularly those connecting to public parking facilities where such connections are not practicable site plans should maximize the opportunity to provide shared parking serving multiple developments bconnecting oceanlake to the ocean oceanlake has a well developed network of eastwest numbered streets providing visual and in some cases physical access to the beach the skyline is not defined by skyscrapers but villagescale storefronts beach cottages and hotels nestled between rolling hills shore pines and ocean bluffs while the city recognizes that it is not possible or practical to preserve all views of the ocean new projects should be designed to take advantage of ocean views while maintaining view corridors from adjacent rightsofway and pedestrian spaces to the greatest extent practicable building stories above 35 feet are required to step back away from the street to maintain a village scale along the street and to allow for sunlight and ocean views crespecting neighborhood transitions developments on the edge of the oceanlake plan district should be made compatible with abutting singlefamily residential uses outside the plan district particularly the singlestory bungalows and cottages in the r15 zone north of nw 19th street the design standards for oceanlake are intended to address compatibility mass scale materials detailing setbacks and other elements ddesigning for the climate temperatures in lincoln city vary widely and it can rain any day of the year people like being outside and will often walk from place to place even when its raining oceanlake has many visitors in the summer and more people are making it their home or second home therefore buildings should be designed to withstand high winds as storms can generate winds of 100 miles per hour rooflines should not be overly complex and should have proper drainage for rainwater roofs should shed and drain water away from building openings parking refuse storage areas and other such areas buildings should incorporate canopies awnings porticos or similar weather protection features pedestrian amenities such as plazas and outdoor seating areas should take advantage of southern exposures and be protected from the wind to the greatest extent practical eaesthetics and contextsensitive design oceanlakes aesthetic is rooted in the areas eclectic mix of beach cottages hotels and main street storefronts nestled between rolling hills shore pines and ocean bluffs the oceanlake plan district encourages new development and redevelopment that honors the past while providing a contemporary interpretation of the areas architecture and history the predominant building materials are painted or naturalstain wood siding shingle lap or boardandbatten masonry block brick and stone detailing may include any of these materials as well as limited use of metal or vinyl for canopies building detailing eg flashing roof gutters drains etc signs art and other detailing while each project is unique the oceanlake design standards of this chapter are intended to provide clear and consistent standards the standards discourage overly thematic formula architecture or designs used by retailers national chain stores franchises and other companies with stores or offices in multiple locations  provided that corporate logos art and similar commercial speech are not restricted fbalancing durability and affordability balancing durability and affordability means that the city is practical in administering its codes great design does not have to be expensive sound design principles quality workmanship longlasting materials and routine maintenance are all important historically development in oceanlake has been characterized by relatively simple building forms with moderate detailing and ornamentation traditional materials such as wood stone and brick are preferred but other materials such as architecturalgrade composite boards shingles and trim may be used when it is demonstrated that the material is durable and fits the overall composition of the proposed design project designs should respect the past while being practical and durable for the future exh b 1a  oceanlake district overlay zones the op district consists of three design subdistricts or overlay zones as shown on the zoning map in appendix b to the ordinance codified in this chapter amain streethighway 101 area the main street area extends approximately onehalf block deep on both sides of the highway between 21st street and 12th street the district is anchored by the lincoln city community center at the north end of highway 101 and a church at the south end the approximate center of oceanlake is northwest 17th street and highway 101 this part of oceanlake is characterized by a traditional street grid with sidewalks street lights storefront commercial uses and proximity to walkable neighborhoods the street grid contains 200foot by 400foot blocks spaced evenly along the highway pedestrian connections and plazas are provided where 16th and 18th streets end at highway 101 binterior area land use west of the highway consists of a mix of commercial and residential uses some in new structures and others in older cottages and houses the area is walkable and easily accessible to adjoining neighborhoods and main street businesses though the sidewalk network is incomplete proximity to highway 101 and the ocean both less than two blocks away makes the area attractive for retail overnight accommodations and touristrelated mixed use development the op district allows commercial uses eg retail commercial services and office uses on the ground floor with dwellings above or behind storefronts upper building stories exceeding 35 feet in height are required to be recessed or stepped back from numbered eastwest axis streets west of highway 101 to maintain view corridors toward the ocean and to provide solar access front yards are minimal and parking is to be provided in public parking facilities pullout bays along the street andor private facilities behind or beside buildings the code encourages the extension of alleys and driveways block interiors to accommodate shared parking coceanfront area the oceanfront is largely builtout with hotels condominiums and other residential uses as infill occurs and some parcels redevelop the op district encourages the retention of ocean view corridors and existing beach access installation of sidewalks and landscape screening of offstreet parking along harbor avenue development adjacent to existing public beach access ways must maintain beach access and ocean views from the adjacent rightofway exh b 1b  applicability of municipal code regulations aapplicability the provisions of the oceanlake plan district in addition to all other applicable regulations of this title and other city ordinances shall apply to all uses of land and development within the op district bredevelopment and remodels where an existing use or development is proposed to be modified or exterior remodeling the standards shall apply only to that portion of the use or development that is to be modified  where more than 50 percent of the use or development is to be modified the reviewing body may require the entire development to conform to the provisions of this chapter as provided in subsection e of this section cburden of proof the applicant has the burden of proof of demonstrating conformity with the standards and criteria of this chapter dwhere conflicts occur between the design standards and other municipal code regulations the provisions of this chapter shall apply enonconforming situations existing uses andor developments that do not conform to the provisions of this chapter but were established lawfully prior to the city adopting this chapter shall be allowed to continue as provided in lcmc nonconforming situations exh b 1c  administration of design standards asite plan review the design standards will be applied to commercial development including mixed use and multifamily dwellings but not including singlefamily or twofamily dwellings that must receive approval citys site plan review process during that process and prior to issuance of building permits singlefamily or twofamily dwellings are subject to the design standards requirements relating to block layout alleys and connections to public parking facilities lcmc  and must receive approval building permit review process the planning director may refer any site plan review application to the planning commission for a public hearing when 1the applicant has requested an adjustment or modification to one or more oceanlake code standards as provided in subsection c of this section  or 2the applicant requests a hearing  or 3the planning director determines that the size or scale of the development visavis its appearance traffic generation parking or other characteristics warrants a public hearing bdesign standards versus guidelines the code sections that follow provide intent statements followed by standards and guidelines most sections contain objective standards and approval criteria  however some criteria require the reviewing body to apply discretion where discretion is involved the code provides guidelines to assist the reviewing body in evaluating a proposal the following further explains the relationship between intent statements standards and guidelines 1intent statements are not applicable approval criteria except requests for adjustments or variance must demonstrate how the proposal conforms to the codes intent 2standards use the words shall or must and are mandatory 3guidelines use the words should may preferred and discouraged and are advisory guidelines supplement the standards and provide examples of acceptable or unacceptable design guidelines also assist in reviewing requests for adjustments and variances and may serve as the basis for approval denial or approval with modifications in such instances 4graphics are used to illustrate standards and guidelines they are not intended to prescribe a particular design but serve as examples of acceptable or unacceptable design solutions 5standards and guidelines both serve as approval criteria but the reviewing body is afforded greater latitude in applying guidelines where the word should is used the applicant must demonstrate that the proposal is consistent with the guideline or that applying an alternate design solution is consistent with the codes stated intent where a guideline conflicts with any code standard the standard shall prevail 6in the case of a proposed variance or adjustment to a code standard the applicant must demonstrate how the variance or adjustment results in equal or greater conformity to the intent of the code and all other applicable standards and guidelines 7nullification of one standard or guideline by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not cause any other standard or guideline to be nullified cadjustmentsmodifications to the standards the standards contained in this chapter may be adjusted or modified without the need for a variance if the applicant demonstrates that 1the chapters guiding principles and the intent statements under the applicable standard to be adjusted can be better met proposed alternative design solution  or 2there are practical difficulties in meeting a standard based on the necessary characteristics of an allowed use in such cases the design must provide other features that tend to meet the goal of the standard such as a trellis with vines a sculpture or a pergola where the code language suggests more than one way to meet a particular standard the applicant is encouraged to be creative and propose the most appropriate design solution given the sites context and the purpose of the code the decisionmaking body shall refer to the guiding principles in lcmc  the purpose in lcmc  and the intent under each standard in making its decision  the purpose guiding principles and intent statements shall serve as the approval criteria for adjustments dincentives for design excellence the city encourages excellence in design projects that provide superior pedestrian spaces pedestrian amenities public art alleys shared parking or superior architecture may be rewarded for example with reduced offstreet parking requirements reduced lot sizes increased allowable building coverage andor assistance from the citys urban renewal program these incentives are in addition to the adjustments provided in of this chapter in granting incentives the hearing body shall find that the incentive results in a design that is superior to what is required under the base standards and is consistent with one or more of the following guidelines 1integration and functionality of land uses mixed use projects combining upperstory residential uses with ground floor commercial or civic uses are preferred over singleuse developments 2connecting oceanlake to the ocean oceanfront projects that provide physical beach access to the public are preferred over those that provide only visual access or no access at all nonoceanfront projects should maintain views of the ocean from public rightsofway where such views currently exist where a project results in diminished ocean views the decision body may consider other mitigating circumstances in approving an incentive such as the provision of pedestrian spaces eg plaza or public parking facilities in the vicinity that enable to the public to more easily access the shoreline 3respecting neighborhood transitions where an applicant requests an exception to the maximum building height standards abutting a residential zone the project must incorporate mitigating design features such as additional open space or buffering adjacent to residential uses applicants are encouraged to do neighborhood outreach prior to submitting site plans to the city for review the applicants efforts to engage the public eg design charrette prior to submitting a site plan application may influence the decision body in approving or denying incentives 4designing for the climate incentives may be appropriate for projects incorporating green building practices such as the preservation of existing mature vegetation use of water quality treatment in parking lots rooftops and landscapes use of renewable energy and energy conservation in construction projects eligible for green certification nationally recognized program eg leadership environmental design leed or similar program approved by the city are preferred over those that do not meet such criteria 5aesthetics and contextsensitive design architecture that goes beyond base code requirements and achieves the vision contained in the oceanlake redevelopment plan is preferred over architecture that merely conforms to the base code requirements for example corner properties along highway 101 particularly those in gateway locations should reach the 35foot allowable height by incorporating a third building story tower or other signature architectural feature oceanfront designs should be superior in both their streetfronting elevation as well as their oceanfronting elevation 6balancing durability and affordability in granting incentives preference may be given to projects providing affordable workforce housing or affordable commercial space to small businesses except overnight accommodations affordable housing means households earning less than the area median income pay no more than 30 percent of their income toward housing costs where incentives are provided the reviewing authority may require the applicantowner to record deed restrictions or provide other assurances that the subject housing remains affordable for not less than 10 years   exh b 1d land use standards  permitted uses table  identifies the land uses allowed in each of the three oceanlake subdistricts uses

oceanlake the standards reflect the following values and objectives aretain oceanlakes compact walkable main street character and improve the highway 101 commercial area as the districts main working shopping and entertainment district bsupport the formation of a mixed use pedestrianoriented district drawing visitors from highway 101 to the ocean cencourage architectural variety consistent with the eclectic character of oceanlake  provided that new development creates a close intimate human scale and architectural design addresses all four sides of a building dencourage the use of contextually appropriate materials textures and colors eprovide a continuous system of alleys and midblock lanes with central public parking and encourage the provision of shared private offstreet parking fcreate vibrant pedestrian spaces eg plazas public art cafe seating areas etc  pedestrian spaces should help identify oceanlake create intrigue and offer weather protection and comfort to pedestrians while adding value to the district gbreak down large building masses and provide visual interest along the street hbalance rhythm and continuity  encourage creativity in the design of building elevations rooflines and facade elements itreat corner lots as focal points with vertical elements public art seating and other features jprovide weather protection where buildings abut the street exh b 3a  block layout alleys and connections to public parking facilities aintent new development and redevelopment projects should reinforce the historic street grid of oceanlake and contribute to the development of central parking facilities interconnected by a system of alleys buildings should be placed at or near the sidewalk edge and parking should be set back behind or beside buildings parking should be provided on street where shoulders are approved to accommodate parking spaces or bays and shared parking areas internal to each block by maintaining the integrity of oceanlakes historic urban form land is used efficiently traffic is distributed evenly and new development contributes to a cohesive pedestrianfriendly district bstandards 1rightsofway anew development

shared access drive buildings abutting the parking area shall provide entrances opening onto it or be connected to the street by a continuous pedestrian walkway eg between buildings buildings and development shall not be configured in a way that precludes public access to such public parking facilities see also lcmc   exh b 3b  buildings and structures aintent while many communities attempt to create or recreate an urban downtown of their own oceanlake already has a main street with a mixture of older and contemporary buildings the interior area of oceanlake between the highway and ocean also has the potential to become a vibrant mixed use neighborhood as envisioned by the oceanlake redevelopment plan the eclectic group of buildings existing along the highway loosely follows the ageless rhythm of a traditional main street therefore building design standards draw on traditional main street elements while allowing for design variety it is not the citys intent to create an architectural theme or to freeze time the design standards are not meant to halt progress or restrict property rights but rather to ensure that new buildings and remodels fit within the context of their surroundings and support a compact pedestrianoriented district in this way the city can ensure that oceanlake retains its sense of place its vitality and economic base the key elements of the building design standards are 1eclectic coastal architecture including residential commercial and mixed use development 2building height and articulated facades that create a sense of street enclosure at a human scale 3contextually appropriate materials textures and colors 4storefront character windows pedestrian shelter furnishings etc 5adaptable building styles that comfortably accommodate commercial residential and mixed land uses 6a diversity of building facades and rooflines that fall into a consistent rhythm 7corner lots as focal points with vertical elements furnishings and public

be removed with new development native vegetation should be preserved where practicable or otherwise replanted in required landscape areas trees and hedges serve as windbreaks and visual screens in an area that is otherwise being exposed to high winds grassy swales capture and cleanse surface water runoff before it infiltrates into the ground or seeps onto the beach mature vegetation also enhances real estate values for these reasons as well as for aesthetic reasons the city requires that all new developments and redevelopment projects attempt to save mature vegetation that is not within building envelopes and provide landscaping in surface parking areas as buffers between uses within street planter strips and to soften the appearance of large building elevations bstandards 1mature landscaping site plans shall incorporate existing mature vegetation that is not within building envelopes and not within areas that are required to be graded or excavated eg for utilities foundations

articulated commercial development design goals and policies and minimum design standards  to protect and promote the citys economic vitality design standards that encourage and reward high quality development while discouraging less attractive and less enduring alternatives  and to enhance and protect the security and health safety and welfare of the public in addition the standards are intended to serve as interim design standards for pearl areas until such a time that the city adopts specific standards for each pearl bin furtherance of this purpose the city considers the following design features to be desirable elements of commercial development and the standards set forth in this chapter are intended to facilitate incorporation of these features into all commercial development projects 1access driveways consistent with lcmc  that provide for safe access and egress with clear visibility of entrances and retail signage 2interconnected driveways with access to local streets wherever possible 3consolidated access and shared driveways where possible 4continuous landscape frontage with specific standards based on building orientation and front setbacks 5landscaped and screened parking areas with natural landscape swales for stormwater and aesthetics 6coordinated lighting retaining walls street furnishings public art and landscape design that ties together the highway corridor ie string areas between oceanlake delake nelscott taft and cutler city 7visual compatibility with development on adjacent sites 8reduced visual clutter associated with overhead utilities freestanding signs in the pearls rooftop signs in the strings and outdoor storage 9quality exterior building materials surfaces and textures 10building locations close to street

pitched roofs with meaningful overhangs and weather protection features such as awnings canopies and pedestrian arcades 15regular or traditional window rhythm 16articulated building forms and massing with significant wall articulation cin furtherance of this purpose the city considers the following design features to be undesirable elements of commercial development 1poorly defined site access points 2excessive surface parking lot paving and redundant driveways 3disjointed parking areas confusing or unsafe circulation pattern 4square boxlike structures with large blank unarticulated wall surfaces 5highly reflective surfaces or heavily tinted glass storefronts 6strongly thematic architectural styles including some forms of franchise architectural styles associated with some chain commercial establishments 7inadequate landscape buffers adjacent to parking lots walkways streets and the highway 8visible outdoor storage loading and equipment areas       applicability athis chapter applies to all commercial and mixed use development in the general commercial and recreation commercial zones for which site plan review is required except where superseded by a specific plan district or overlay zone eg oceanlake and taft established for a similar purpose different standards apply depending on whether a property is within a designated pearl or string district bwhere an existing use or development is proposed to be modified or exterior remodeling the standards shall apply only to that portion of the use or development that is to be modified  however where more than 50 percent of the use or development is to be modified the entire use or development as applicable shall comply with the provisions of this chapter cthe applicant has the burden of proof of demonstrating conformity with the standards and criteria of this chapter dwhere conflicts occur between the design standards and other municipal code regulations or other ordinances the provisions of this chapter shall apply eexisting uses andor developments that do not conform to the provisions of this chapter but were established lawfully prior to the city adopting this chapter shall be allowed to continue as provided in lcmc nonconforming situations     administration of design standards and guidelines asite plan review for properties within the rc and gc zones site plan review required by lcmc  must include review of these commercial design standards the site plan review process is an administrative review by the planning director the planning director may refer any site plan review application to the planning commission for a public hearing when 1the applicant has requested an adjustment or modification to one or more code standards as provided in subsection d of this section  or 2the applicant requests a hearing  or 3the planning director determines that the size or scale of the development visavis its appearance traffic generation parking or other characteristics warrants a public hearing bdesign standards versus guidelines the code sections that follow provide intent statements followed by standards and guidelines most sections contain objective standards and approval criteria  however some criteria require the reviewing body to apply discretion where discretion is involved the code provides guidelines to assist the reviewing body in evaluating a proposal the following further explains the relationship between intent statements standards and guidelines 1intent statements are not applicable approval criteria except requests for adjustments or variance must demonstrate how the proposal conforms to the codes intent 2standards use the words shall or must and are mandatory 3guidelines use the words should may preferred and discouraged and are advisory guidelines supplement the standards and provide examples of acceptable or unacceptable design guidelines also assist in reviewing requests for adjustments and variances and may serve as the basis for approval denial or approval with modifications in such instances 4graphics are used to illustrate standards and guidelines they are not intended to prescribe a particular design but serve as examples of acceptable or unacceptable design solutions 5standards and guidelines both serve as approval criteria but the reviewing body is afforded greater latitude in applying guidelines where the word should is used the applicant must demonstrate that the proposal is consistent with the guideline or that applying an alternate design solution is consistent with the codes stated intent where a guideline conflicts with any code standard the standard shall prevail 6in the case of a proposed variance or adjustment to a code standard the applicant must demonstrate how the variance or adjustment results in equal or greater conformity to the intent of the code and all other applicable standards and guidelines 7nullification of one standard or guideline by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not cause any other standard or guideline to be nullified severability cburden of proof the applicant must demonstrate how his or her proposal meets all of the applicable standards contained in this chapter and other applicable city regulations the applicant must also demonstrate that the proposal is consistent with the guidelines or provide evidence of why a particular guideline is not relevant given the context of the site and proposed use dadjustmentsmodifications to the standards the standards contained in this chapter may be adjusted or modified without the need for a variance if the applicant demonstrates that 1the codes guiding principles as contained in of this chapter and the intent statements under the applicable standard to be adjusted of this chapter can be better met proposed alternative design solution  or 2necessary characteristics of an allowed use present practical difficulties in meeting a standard in such cases the design must provide other features that tend to meet the goal of the standard such as a trellis with vines a sculpture or a pergola where the code language suggests more than one way to meet a particular standard the applicant is encouraged to be creative and propose the most appropriate design solution given the sites context and the purpose of the code the decisionmaking body shall refer to the purpose and intent in lcmc  and the intent under each standard to be adjusted in making its decision  the purpose guiding principles and intent statements shall serve as the approval criteria for adjustments    guiding principles  guiding principles  pearls the following are intended to serve as interim design standards for areas zoned gcpo and rcpo until the city adopts redevelopment plans and implementing regulations for such areas the standards reflect the following values and objectives aenhance lincoln citys historic village centers bfacilitate the development of compact walkable village centers csupport the formation of a mixed use pedestrianoriented district serving residents and visitors ddevelop an interconnected system of driveways or alleys with central public parking and encourage the provision of shared private offstreet parking eencourage architecture that is consistent with the character of each village or pearl while ensuring that new development creates a close intimate human scale and architectural designs address all four sides of a building fencourage the use of contextually appropriate materials textures and colors gpromote storefront uses by orienting buildings and their entrances to the street or to pedestrian spaces abutting the street hcreate vibrant pedestrian spaces eg plazas public art cafe seating areas etc oriented to take advantage of southern exposures  pedestrian spaces should help identify the village create intrigue and offer weather protection and comfort to pedestrians while adding value to adjoining properties ibreak down large building masses and provide visual interest along the street jbalance rhythm and continuity  encourage creativity in the design of building elevations rooflines and facade elements ktreat corner lots as focal points with vertical elements public art seating and other design features lprovide weather protection where commercial and mixed use buildings abut the street     guiding principles  strings a wide variety of site conditions within the commercial areas of the community make uniform application of design standards difficult most of the string areas are developed with commercial uses although some are sparsely developed some buildings are placed right up to the highway  others are set back 100 feet or more behind large parking lots in many locations grade changes make connections between individual properties difficult and have resulted in a disjointed pattern with closely spaced driveways onto the highway and few secondary accesses or local street connections the design standards for strings are intended to accomplish the following objectives aimprove transportation operations and safety for all modes of travel bbetter integrate land use and transportation planning cprotect and enhance aesthetic values dcontribute to the unique identity and design of each pearl eg by providing landscape and building orientation standards that distinguish between strings and pearls    design standards and guidelines  site design aintent 1define the edges of the highway with noticeable transitions between strings and pearls 2institute a continuous landscape frontage utilize planters with shrubs and street trees in tree wells where space does not allow planting strips 3orient buildings to streets or where buildings are to be set back from the street require pedestrian orientation and appropriate landscaping 4maintain onstreet parking where it currently exists 5over time remove visual clutter along streets such as power poles overhead lines rooftop signs and internally illuminated

trees will be removed with new development native vegetation should be preserved where practicable or otherwise replanted in required landscape areas trees and hedges serve as windbreaks and visual screens in an area that is otherwise being exposed to high winds grassy swales capture and cleanse surface water runoff before it infiltrates into the ground or seeps onto the beach mature vegetation also enhances real estate values for these reasons as well as for aesthetic reasons the city requires that all new developments and redevelopment projects attempt to save mature vegetation that is not within building envelopes and provide landscaping in surface parking areas as buffers between uses within street planter strips and to soften the appearance of large building elevations landscaping
