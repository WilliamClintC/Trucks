additional threats to public safety in passing upon applications for variances the floodplain administrator shall satisfy all relevant factors and procedures specified in other sections of the zoning ordinance and consider the following additional factors 1 the danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments no variance shall be granted for any proposed use development or activity within any special floodway district that will cause any increase in the 100year flood elevation 2 the danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or

additional threats to public safety c extraordinary public expense  and will not d create nuisances e cause fraud or victimization of the public or f conflict with local laws or ordinances variances shall be issued only after the floodplain administrator has determined that the variance will be the minimum required to provide relief the floodplain administrator shall notify the applicant for a variance in writing that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the 100year flood elevation a increases the risks to life and property and b will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance a record shall be maintained of the above notification as well as all variance actions including justification for the issuance of the variances any variances that are issued shall

finds that uncontrolled drainage and runoff associated with land development has a significant impact upon the health safety and welfare of the community including but not limited to the following aspects a stormwater runoff can carry pollutants into receiving water bodies degrading water quality  b the increase in nutrients in stormwater runoff such as phosphorus and nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of receiving waters  c construction requiring land disturbance of andor the alteration of natural topography tends to increase erosion  d siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases their capacity to hold and transport water interferes with navigation and harms plant and animal life  e impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater

the siting of services and infrastructure including the opportunity to reduce length of roads utility lines and the amount of paving required for residential development  3 to provide for a diversity of lot sizes building densities and housing choices to accommodate a variety of age and income groups and residential preferences so that the citys population diversity may be maintained  4 to implement adopted city policies to conserve a variety of irreplaceable and environmentally sensitive resource lands as designated in the citys comprehensive plan the chesapeake bay preservation area district ordinance and the rural overlay district  5 to provide incentives to create a conservation corridor system for the southern watershed area as defined in the memorandum of agreement to improve the coordination of the wetlands compensation process in the southern watershed area for the benefit of present and future residents  6 to implement adopted land use transportation and community policies as identified in the citys comprehensive plan  7 to protect areas of the city with productive agricultural soils for continued or future agricultural use by conserving blocks of land large enough to allow for efficient farm operations  8 to create communities with strong neighborhood identities visual access to open land and amenities in the form of neighborhood open space  9 to provide for the conservation and maintenance of open land within the city to achieve the abovementioned goals and for active or passive recreational use by residents  10 to provide multiple options for

conservation and agricultural districts  10100  intent the citys adopted comprehensive plan emphasizes that agriculture in this city is a basic social economic and environmental asset and that the city should encourage its survival the adopted comprehensive plan further states that our environment is fundamental and cannot be taken for granted this is particularly true of those areas of the city which are considered to be environmentally sensitive areas such as the northwest river the dismal swamp chesapeake and albemarle canal north landing river and wetlands and hardwood swamps finally the plan recognizes the very important role recreation and open space play in the provision of a healthy environment to that end the permitted and conditional uses provided in the conservation and agricultural districts are limited to those activities which support or are related to the preservation of environmentally sensitive and recreational lands and to agricultural work and life and the people of the agricultural community largescale residential development is presumed to be incompatible with agricultural operations in the southern portion of the city where most agricultural production now occurs such developments could place a burden on city infrastructure and services furthermore active and passive recreational lands passive open spaces significant natural features and environmentally sensitive areas should be treated as finite irreplaceable resources with both public and private value  therefore construction is to be limited within the conservation areas which is consistent with their preservation and which promotes their use and enjoyment o081 112117  10200  development standards applicable to all conservation and agricultural development specific design

o149 112205  12402  findings of fact fentress airfield is an auxiliary landing strip located in the southern portion of the city which is utilized by the us navy as part of its nas oceana operation the airfield is used primarily for simulated aircraft carrier landings and has been used in that capacity since world war ii in response to residential growth in southern chesapeake in the area near the airfield the department of defense established the air installation compatible use zone aicuz program in 197 which analyzed the impact of the noise from aircraft operations at the field on existing and potential development in the area the current aicuz program delineates the following three noise contours around the airfield 1 noise levels between 65 and 70 dnl 2 noise levels between 70 and 75 dnl and 3 noise levels greater than 75 dnl the aicuz program also delineates a clear zone and two accident potential zones apzs apzi described as an area beyond the airport clear zone and apzii described as an area beyond apzi both of which have measurable potential for aircraft accidents due to concerns over possible conflict between fentress operations and continued residential growth the us navy purchased development rights on over eight thousand 8000 acres of land within the fentress area to prevent residential development the us navy also published recommendations for various nonresidential uses which would be more compatible with the airfield operations the navy amended its aicuz program in 1998 to reflect the proposed expansion of airfield operations said amendments being depicted on that certain document entitled the 1999 composite aicuz  nalf fentress the city of chesapeake first adopted the fentress airfield overlay district on  as a means of protecting against incompatible land uses and encouraging certain agricultural light industrial and commercial uses that would be more compatible with aircraft noise levels experienced in the overlay district this ordinance has been amended from time to time since 1990 to expand the overlay and increase the protections offered land uses attenuation measures and disclosure requirements in august 200 the base realignment and closure brac commission recommended the realignment of nas oceana by relocating the atlantic fleets east coast master jet base to cecil field in jacksonville florida if among other things the cities of virginia beach and chesapeake fail to enact and enforce legislation to prevent further encroachment of nas oceana and fentress airfield by the end of march 2006 such legislation includes adopting zoning ordinances that require the city council to follow aicuz guidelines in deciding discretionary development applications for property in noise contours 70 db day night average noise level dnl or greater the cities must also adopt the recommendations in the 2005 regional joint land use study jlus the jlus was accepted by resolution of the city council on  at which time chesapeake had already implemented most of the recommendations contained in the report however expansion of the noise attenuation standards and adoption of an avigation easement program remained to be accomplished based on this history city council finds that residential development within noise contours 65 dnl or greater are not compatible with the existing fentress operation most properties within this area are best suited for agricultural operations and city council intends to continue agricultural operations as the predominant use in this area accordingly some limited commercial and industrial development which does not place significant demands on existing infrastructure and which can be constructed landscaped and operated in a manner which does not detract from the rural character of the area would in certain limited circumstances be compatible with the community located within the noise contours in addition city council finds that sound attenuation measures should be expanded and notice requirements implemented to alert the public that property buildings and structures are situated partially or wholly within the noise contours o158 102098  o057 42004  o149 112205  12403  purpose and intent this ordinance is enacted to regulate development within the fentress airfield overlay district subject to case by case review by the planning commission and

developed over the course of several decades beginning in the late nineteenth century extending establishment of south norfolk as an incorporated city in 191 and maintaining its commercial vitality s the focus of this commercial area was on serving the residential neighborhoods and local industries within south norfolk and given this local focus during the period of its greatest growth and activity this commercial area developed a distinctive character and appearance as an openair pedestrianoriented place with a large number of businesses within easy walking distance of one another its rows of buildings lack of setbacks integrated land uses architecture density onstreet parking and limited number of large surface parking areas combine to create a downtown urban environment unique in the city of chesapeake as the subsequent development of regional malls and the change in the nature and location of industrial activity in the area reduced the numbers of customers and the demands for services in the south norfolk business district the appearance and vitality of the area declined the residential community which the business district served also experienced a period of decline however joint efforts of the city and the chesapeake redevelopment and housing authority a program of residential revitalization and historic preservation was initiated in order to maintain the unique and historically significant physical and architectural features of the community while at the same time making the areas homes and neighborhoods attractive to a wide variety of citizens several homes in the area were designated as historic landmarks and the historically significant architecture and appearance of the community in general were recognized and preserved the continued revitalization of the south norfolk area depends upon revitalizing the communitys historic relationship with the business community which anchors it and both preserving and restoring those characteristics of the business district which make it attractive and viable  12603  purpose and intent the purpose and intent of creating the south norfolk business overlay district are to establish special zoning
