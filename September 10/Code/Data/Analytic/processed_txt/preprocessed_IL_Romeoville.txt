included all positions shall be grouped in classes having a definite range of difficulty and responsibility each class may specify examples of work which are illustrative of duties of positions allocated to the class requirements as to knowledge abilities and skills necessary for performance of the work and a statement of experience and training desirable for recruitment into the classification minimum requirements may be added for any position bthe class specifications shall be considered as descriptive rather than restrictive they shall be used to indicate the types of positions that should be allocated to the respective classes and not as prescribing what the duties or responsibilities of any specific position shall be or as modifying the power of a department head or supervisor to assign duties direct control or evaluate the work of any employee cas often as necessary to assure continued correct classification the position classification plan shall be reviewed by the village manager and necessary adjustments shall be made dany additions deletions or other changes in the position classification plan shall be submitted to the village manager for approval board approval shall be required for changes in the position of the village manager and department heads ethe position classification plan shall be filed with the village manager the plan so filed and subsequently adjusted shall have the same effect as though it were a part of this personnel manual femployee advanced ranges 1the starting salary of the range minimum is the normal hiringpromoting rate exceptions to this starting point should be limited to hiring situations involving applicants with exceptional background and qualifications a promotion in which the employees current compensation is higher than the minimum of the new range or in the case of a labor market situation where it is impossible to recruit qualified candidates at the minimum in these cases employees may be appointed to their positions anywhere within the defined range depending on their experiences and qualifications and based on the provisions of the villages personnel manual employees should not be hired below the minimum of their compensation range 2salary advancement between the hiring rate and the top of the range maximum is done throughout the employees tenure with the village advancement range may be done on an annual basis and be dependent on a satisfactory performance evaluation incumbents progressing range should understand that standards of performance would become more exacting or controlling as compensation levels advance typical movement range could be in increments of 1% to 3% depending on the employees performance evaluation and goal attainment as well as the financial resources of the village 3the village may set aside a merit pool every year so as to fund increases for employees in this plan this money would then service as the pool for merit increases knowing that some employees will be high performers getting a higher percentage and some employees will be lower performers getting a lower percentage 4it should also be noted that the implementation and use of a formal performance evaluation process for all staff members is a key component to the success of this merit system equally if not more important is to have supervisors be adequately trained to perform the formal performance evaluation process gfuture administration of the nonunion compensation plan 1in order to maintain competitive salary levels and salary ranges there should be an annual review of the villages salary ranges 2it is the further recommendation of the consulting team that the salary range for each grade be increased by the average percentages increase of the comparable group and that each employee be granted the same percentage increase so that he or she retain the same position in the new salary range as he or she had in the previous range employees would also continue to advance compensation ranges provided that the employee is not at the maximum of the compensation range by virtue of a merit increase granted for satisfactory performance of their job duties these increases would be in addition to the increase the employees received from the acrosstheboard adjustments to the ranges once an employee reaches the maximum of the compensation range increases may still be granted but based on a lump sum methodology 3the administration of a classification plan is an ongoing process it must be recognized that it is not static and is not intended to affix positions permanently to job classes instead the plan must be administered continually to adapt it to changing conditions 4three specific types of changes in the plan itself are possible abolition of the class creation of a class or adjustment revision of the class when all positions in a class are abolished or when positions are significantly changed in the nature of work duties and responsibilities so that the class becomes inappropriate or inaccurate the class should be abolished similarly new classes should be created when new work situations arise that are not covered by the established class however caution should be exercised in this respect particularly to assure that the new classes are justified are not merely duplicating established classes cannot be accommodated in existing classes and reflect substantially permanent rather than temporary situations the adjustment or revision of a class should be done when there are substantial changes to the requirements of the position or to the nature and complexities of the duties being performed all changes should be thoroughly evaluated for their effect on employee morale and the integrity of the class relationships

aauthentication to systems 1authentication is the process that allows authorized users to provide and prove their identity to access village systems the village maintains several types of systems and most systems require some form of authentication for access required authentication can be as simple as accessing a system from an approved workstation or as complicated as requiring possession of an authentication device the requirements for the type of authentication assigned to a system or user is based on the sensitivity of the system generally speaking systems with very sensitive information or systems that provide the ability to change or access information from uncontrolled mobile locations will require more stringent authentication 2there are three possible forms or factors of authentication asomething you know username and password or pin number  bsomething you have a special key card or token  or csomething you are biometrics such as fingerprints voice recognition etc 3the basic form of authentication is single factor and is generally based on something you know this information is equivalent to a key and in most cases will identify an individual person extended authentication is multifactor meaning that something you know will be combined with something you have if multifactor authentication is required each user will be issued a special device called a key usually a village id or token that will be combined with something they know a pin or password to provide authentication in the future the village may choose to employ the third factor such as fingerprints 4if you have been issued a token or village id access device you should treat this as any other key you are responsible for keeping your pin private and for keeping the key itself secure if the key is ever lost or compromised you must report it to the it department immediately if you lost your village id or token you will be responsible for the cost of replacement 5unless clearly distinguished as shared all authentication methods are unique and private to an individual user and should never be shared with other users 6your computer must be locked if it is logged on and

standards is mandatory 1where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater pretreatment coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 cfr 4036c unless specifically restricted by the categorical standard these equivalent limitations calculated in accordance of the following requirements are deemed pretreatment standards users shall be required to comply with the equivalent limitations instead of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived an alternative pretreatment limit shall not be used if the alternative limit is below the analytical detection limit for any of the regulated pollutants 2awhen the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit production the village may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual users bthe village calculating equivalent massperday limitations shall calculate such limitations by multiplying the limits in the standard by the users average rate of production this average rate of production shall be based not upon the designed production capacity but rather upon a reasonable measure of the users actual longterm daily production during a representative year for new sources actual production shall be estimated using projected production cthe village calculating equivalent concentration limitations shall calculate such limitations by dividing the mass limitations by the average daily flow rate of the users regulated process wastewater this average daily flow rate must be based upon a reasonable measure of the users actual longterm average flow rate such as the average daily flow rate during the representative year 3when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard pretreatment coordinator shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 cfr 4036e provided that the regulation allows the wastewaters to be mixed and the user can supply the information necessary to issue an alternative limit 4a user may request a variance from usepa based on fundamentally different factors the request must comply with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 cfr 40313 5a user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with 40 cfr 40315 call users that are subject to national categorical pretreatment standards are required to file reports as required in this chapter signed by an authorized representative these reports shall include all information that the village deems necessary to make compliance determinations passed 12104   state limits all users are subject to state standards and requirements as defined in 35 iac 307 specifically the standards for discharge of mercury and cyanide are as follows amercury iac  1except as provided below no person shall cause or allow the concentration of mercury in any discharge to a publicly owned or publicly regulated sewer system to exceed the following level subject to the averaging rule contained in 35 ill adm a  constituent storet number concentration mgl mercury 71900   2it shall be an exception to division a if the discharge is to a publicly owned or publicly regulated sewer system which is required to meet a limitation less stringent than the  mgl mercury concentration in which case the discharge limitation shall be the same as that applicable to the publicly owned or regulated sewer system to which it discharges 3it shall be an exception to division 1 if all the following conditions are met athe discharger does not use mercury  or the discharger uses mercury and this use cannot be eliminated  or the discharger uses mercury only in chemical analysis or in laboratory or other equipment and takes reasonable care to avoid contamination of wastewater  and bthe discharge mercury concentration is less than  mgl as determined by application of the averaging rules of 35 ill adm a  and cthe discharger is providing the best degree of treatment consistent with technological feasibility economic reasonableness and sound engineering judgment this may include no treatment for mercury  and dthe discharger has an inspection and maintenance program likely to reduce or to prevent an increase in the level of mercury discharges 4the discharge of wastes from medicinal or therapeutic use of mercury exclusive of laboratory use shall be exempt from the limitations of division 1 if all the following conditions are met athe total discharge is less than 227 g 12pound as mercury hg in any year  bthis discharge is to a public sewer system  and cthe discharge does not alone or in conjunction with other sources cause the effluent from the sewer system or treatment plant to exceed  mgl of mercury 5no person shall cause or allow any discharge of mercury to a publicly owned or publicly regulated sewer system which alone or in combination with other sources causes a violation by the sewer treatment plant discharge of the water quality standard of 35 ill adm for mercury applicable in the receiving stream 6for purposes of permit issuance the agency may consider application of the exception of division 2 or 3 to determine compliance with this section the agency may impose permit conditions necessary or required to assure continued application of the exception when division 2 or 3 applies the agency may impose an effluent limitation in the permit that allows the discharge of a

parcel of land from the street also called a rightofway line street classification the hierarchy of road types based on size and traffic volume the classification system used by the village is the standard set by the american association of state highway and transportation officials street classification interstate expressway typical uses are for regional and national trips these routes are divided highways with no direct access to fronting properties direct access is limited to periodic interchanges street classification major arterial many of the trips on a major arterial are trips that span an entire community and beyond to neighboring communities however they are meant to serve all types of trips in many cases properties fronting major arterials have limited access so as to not impede the traffic flow major arterials typically connect to other regional arterials and expressways to link cities and counties often under the jurisdiction of the state or county these streets typically require a minimum of two lanes in each direction plus turn lanes traffic volumes greater than 15000 vehicles per day can be expected street classification secondary arterial also serving all types of trips the primary use for secondary arterials are trips within the community this street type is not meant to carry a significant amount of regional trips  however they do often connect to major arterials the main purpose of the secondary arterial is to provide efficient traffic flow and increase the traffic capacity of the community these roads also serve adjacent landuses with more access points than a major arterial secondary arterials do not normally penetrate residential neighborhoods the majority of these streets are under the jurisdiction of the county or village and typically carry under 15000 vehicles per day street classification major collector the primary use for major collectors are trips within the community similar to the secondary arterial but do not provide the connectivity to neighboring communities the major collector provides connections between arterials but should not carry many regional trips access points to residential commercial and industrial areas are found on these streets traffic volumes can vary depending on the community and continuity of the street in the village these streets are under the jurisdiction of the village and carry between 5000 and 10000 vehicles per day street classification minor collector also known as a neighborhood collector these streets typically are meant to serve only vehicletrips generated to and from residential subdivisions business developments or industrial parks in the community minor collectors fuse traffic to the major collectors and eventually arterials they are not meant as normally are no longer than one mile minor collectors are under village jurisdiction and typically carry less than 5000 vehicles per day street classification residential streets in the village are considered as residential unless otherwise designated as arterials or collectors these streets are only meant to connect residences within a neighborhood to collector roadways structural alterations any change other than incidental repairs and remodeling which would prolong the life of the supporting members of a building or structure such as bearing walls columns beams and girders subdivision any of the

streets and major driveways the criteria are based on american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto and the illinois department of transportation idot design procedures this section has been adopted to provide for safe turning movements by providing clear visibility zones at intersections clear of obstructions such as trees walls signs buildings etc this policy is not intended for determining traffic controls at intersections the need for traffic controls is to be assessed by the rules and regulations contained in the manual on uniform traffic control devices and as recommended by the village engineer 2the application of intersection sight distance and stopping sight distance shall extend to all proposed and existing public street intersections and all proposed and existing intersections of private streets and drives with public streets including multifamily and commercial entrances this also includes local to local intersections such as those within proposed subdivisions the village requires that both intersection and stopping sight distances shall be shown with their geometries on all final construction drawings and be analyzed during the traffic impact study process bvisual obstructions visual obstructions shall be defined as any object within intersection sight triangles between the heights of no more than three feet measured

referenced from the guide for the development of bicycle facilities aashto 4th edition 2012 1intersections that are not controlled by stop signs or signals are to be considered as yieldcontrolled intersections 2for yieldcontrolled intersections between multiuse paths and roadways use the following figurestables to calculate the appropriate sight triangles approach sight triangles depend on the design speeds of both the path and the roadway if yield control is to be used for either approach it is desirable that available sight distance be adequate for a traveler on the yieldcontrolled approach to slow stop and to avoid a traveler on the other approach the roadway leg of the sight triangle is based on bicyclists ability to reach and cross the roadway if they do not see a potentially conflicting vehicle approaching the roadway and have just passed the point where they can execute a stop without entering the intersection figure 515 table 57 for roadway leg and table 58 for path leg shall be used for this condition    3 for an uncontrolled intersection of a shared use path with a walkway ie under yield control a clear sight triangle extending at least 15 feet along the walkway should be provided see figure 516  4if a shared use path intersects with another shared use path sight triangles should be provided similar to a yield condition at a pathroadway intersection however both legs of the sight triangle should be based on the stopping sight distance of the paths use the equation in table 57 for both legs of the sight triangle passed 111815   lot coverage  structure or

in residential dwelling units such uses have been allowed largely on the basis that such uses are incidental to the use of the premises as a residence that the nature of home occupational uses is such that they are compatible with or even belong in the home or that home occupational uses are of a highly professional nature involving the use of mental rather than physical capabilities and are therefore compatible with residential land uses 2it is recognized however by this village that certain limited home occupations can be useful to both the general public as well as the residentproprietor also recognized is the difficulty of writing and ordinance dealing with home occupations in a middleoftheroad fashion which is neither discriminatory nor arbitrary it is the hope that both the citizens and the courts will recognize these difficulties  that the former will not abuse the privileges granted within the following test and that the latter will aid in the enforcement of the sometimes arbitrary restrictions necessary to preserve residential character in an expedient manner 3with the above in mind it is the intent and purpose of this section to provide for certain
