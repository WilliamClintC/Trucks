disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  12603 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to aprotect human life and health

potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area  12604 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods arestrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  dcontrol filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and eprevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  article b definitions 12605 definitions enumerated unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this

expressway primary thoroughfare or secondary thoroughfare major street any street classified as an expressway primary thoroughfare or secondary thoroughfare minor street any street classified as a collector street or a local street primary thoroughfares an arterial route where access is only partially controlled where traffic loads do not justify the design of an expressway secondary

and sheltering structures from energy losses caused by weather and wind cmitigate the loss of natural resources dprovide visual screens and buffers that mitigate the impact of conflicting land uses to preserve the appearance character and value of existing neighborhoods eprovide shade comfort and seasonal color freduce glare noise and heat gprovide greater perceptual clarity along major streets and

compliance with its permit control production or all discharges or both until the operation of the treatment facility is restored or an alternate method of treatment is provided this requirement applies for example when the primary source of power of the treatment facility fails or is reduced it shall not be a defense for the permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the conditions of this permit cbypass of treatment facilities 1an industrial user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the reporting requirements of this article  2if an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the city if possible at least ten 10 days before the date of

hours  4bypass is prohibited unless ait was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  bthere was no feasible alternative such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and cthe industrial user submitted the notices as required by subsections c2 and c3 of this section  5the city may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the city determines that it will meet the three 3 conditions

discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the users expense detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the superintendent before the

telephone to enable countermeasures to be taken by the superintendent to minimize damage to the potw the health and welfare of the public and the environment this notification shall be followed within five 5 days of the date of the occurrence by a detailed written statement describing the cause of the accidental discharge and measures being taken to prevent future occurrence such notification will not relieve the user of liability for any expense loss or damage to the potw fish kills or any other damage to person or property  nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or state or federal law cnotice to employees employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure  article c industrial user monitoring 17325 monitoring facilities athe installation of a monitoring facility shall be required for all industrial users having wastes which receive pretreatment or otherwise altered or regulated before discharge or are unusually strong and thereby subject to a surcharge the monitoring facility shall be a manhole or other suitable facility approved by the superintendent bwhen in the judgment of the superintendent there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by different operations of a single user the superintendent may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each source of discharge cmonitoring facilities that are required to be installed shall be constructed and maintained at the users expense the purpose of the facility is to enable inspection sampling and flow measurement of the wastewater produced by a user if sampling or metering equipment is also required by the superintendent it shall be provided and installed at the users expense dthe monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on the users premises outside of the building the superintendent may however when such location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user allow the facility to be constructed in the public street right of way with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction of that right of way and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles ethere shall be ample room in or near such a sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis the facility sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user fwhether constructed on public or private property the monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with
