deceptive highpressure factually unbalanced or otherwise unfair consumer sales practices in a manner consistent with the constitutional rights of residential commercial solicitors to communicate their messages to willing residential listeners 1 commercial residential solicitation generally represents a greater intrusion upon residential privacy than political religious or other noncommercial doortodoor solicitation involving the dissemination of ideas city of orem ut  commercial residential solicitation generally entails a higher incidence of consumer fraud and unfair sales practices than political religious or other noncommercial doortodoor solicitation involving the dissemination of ideas substantial numbers of city residents do not desire to listen to or otherwise receive commercial solicitations additionally some residents are particularly vulnerable to consumer fraud and unfair consumer sales practices by commercial residential solicitors 2 the orem department of public safety hereinafter the department has investigated complaints and problems relating to residential solicitation within the city including the following the department investigated fourteen complaints involving residential solicitation in 2006 and twentysix complaints in 2007 residents complained among other things about residential solicitors trespassing surveilling residents property refusing to leave the complainants property when asked contacting residents at homes posted with a no solicitation sign selling stolen property representing nonexistent businesses claiming to represent a legitimate business when in fact they didnt and using aggressive sales techniques based upon such investigation the department has concluded that commercial doortodoor solicitation within the city often involves intrusions upon residential privacy consumer fraud and unfair consumer sales practices 3 the department has found consumer fraud and deceptive highpressure factually unbalanced or otherwise unfair consumer sales practices are employed significantly less frequently in cases of charitable solicitation and solicitation occurring incident to political religious and other noncommercial speech entailing the dissemination of ideas 4 the transient nature of the business of residential solicitation makes it difficult to prosecute or to obtain redress for intrusions upon residential privacy and fraudulent or otherwise unfair consumer sales practices by residential solicitors because such solicitors are typically nonresidents of the city and often leave the city immediately upon completion of their commercial solicitation of the city furthermore many companies that employ residential solicitors do not conduct accurate thorough and timely criminal background checks on prospective solicitors 5 because commercial residential solicitation a involves the attempt to complete an economic transaction with the hearer and b may include aggressive deceptive factually unbalanced or otherwise unfair tactics in an effort to complete an economic transaction commercial residential solicitation entails a heightened risk of intrusion upon residential privacy consumer fraud and unfair consumer sales practices albeit by a minority of those engaged in this business the city wishes to reassure residents to the extent reasonably possible consistent with the first amendment that the residential commercial solicitors who work within the city have not been the subject of criminal actions consumer protection actions or other legal orders or actions reasonably related to the risk of such solicitors intruding upon residential privacy or committing consumer fraud or other unfair consumer sales practices by instituting a residential solicitation registration procedure 6 the council finds that the potential and actual harm to citizens from residential solicitation is real and that the provisions hereinafter set forth will to a material degree alleviate and avoid such harm the council has determined that the means chosen as hereinafter stated are reasonable and are closely fitted to achieve the desired objective of protecting citizens from intrusions upon residential privacy consumer fraud and unfair consumer sales practices while simultaneously preserving the rights of others to engage in speech protected by the first amendment to the

applicability 1 the purpose of planned development pd zones is to provide flexibility in the citys zoning scheme in order to allow for unique innovative and wellplanned developments that would not be possible under one of the citys existing zoning classifications pd zones are not intended for use in situations where a proposed development is reasonably feasible under one of the citys existing zoning classifications 2 pd zones are intended for use primarily where no existing zoning classification is both sufficiently permissive to allow uses that would be suitable on the property and sufficiently restrictive to protect the character and city of orem ut  quality of neighboring properties examples of this type of situation may include but are not limited to the following a mixeduse developments  b townhouse or other highdensity residential developments  c where a few uses in an existing zone such as the c2 zone would be appropriate on a particular parcel of property but the remainder of the uses in that zone would not be appropriate  d where the setbacks building height limits or other standards of an existing zone are not necessary for the protection of neighboring properties or the general welfare of the city because of the proximity of a parcel of property to a particular landscape feature such as a cliff or a hillside where there would be no negative impact from a relaxation of such standards  and e where additional setbacks or other buffers are needed to protect neighboring properties from uses to be employed on a parcel of property 3 the city council finds that state street 800 north center street and university parkway are vital commercial corridors within the city therefore the city has conducted an intensive study and evaluation of state street resulting in the adoption of the state street corridor master plan in 2015 this study has determined among other things what types of uses are appropriate on state street ways to promote redevelopment along state street ways to attract new business and enhance the economic viability of the state street corridor the extent to which residential uses should be allowed on state street measures that can be taken to enhance the visual appeal of state street and ways to enhance transportation circulation and walkability of the area based on the outcome of the study five new state street district zones are planned for the state street corridor area which will include permitted uses and design standards specifically tailored for each district the city council finds that it is in the best interest of the city to continue to not allow any new pd zones for residential development along state street 800 north center street and university parkway pending the outcome of further studies and the city councils evaluation of said studies therefore effective  and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary no new application will be accepted for the creation of a pd zone that allows residential units within five hundred feet 500 of state street 800 north center street or university parkway furthermore based on the outcome of the state street corridor master plan the city council finds that it is in the best interest of the city not to permit the creation of any new pd zones that allow residential uses on any current residentiallyzoned lot namely the os5 r20 r12 r8 r75 r65 r6 and r5 zones therefore effective  and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary no new application will be accepted for the creation of a pd zone that allows residential units on any current residentiallyzoned lot namely the os5 r20 r12 r8 r75 r65 r6 and r5 zones all aforementioned prohibitions shall remain in effect until modification of this section by the city council however the current intent of the city council is that this prohibition will be temporary and the city council intends to reevaluate the appropriateness of residential pd zones along state street 800 north center street and university parkway after further studies are conducted nothing herein shall prohibit the city council from considering and approving a pd zone allowing residential dwellings along state

defined as a use the majority of sales or revenues of which are subject to utah state sales tax enacted  j signspurpose and intent due to the size and nature of the pd34 zone the purposes and

differ significantly from the regulations applicable to signage in other areas of the city signage in the pd34 zone shall be subject to more exactingstringent requirements as to architectural style and aesthetics and shall also have more liberal treatment as to offpremise signage than other areas in the city the more stringent requirements as to aesthetics and the more liberal treatment as to offpremise signage are justified by the following 1 development in the pd34 zone both existing and future is the most intensive area of commercial activity in the city both in terms of size acreage and commercial activity based on retail sales as compared to any other development in the city the area of the pd34 zone is effectively the commercial hub of the city it is anticipated that with the adoption of the pd34 zone commercial activity will become even more intense with the addition of new retail buildings office buildings and parking structures offpremise signs are consistent and compatible with a development of this size scale and intensity of use while they are not appropriate in most other commercial areas of the city offpremise signage is allowed in other large commercial and mixed use developments throughout the country that are similar to development in the pd34 zone both existing and future and the city has determined that offpremise signage will also be compatible in the pd34 zone 2 the signage allowed in the pd34 zone including offpremise signage will enhance the aesthetic quality of the pd34 zone unlike any other zone or area in the city signage in the pd34 zone will be required to conform to strict standards of architectural style and aesthetic quality signage in the pd34 zone is considered a critical component of development in the zone not just for the messages they contain but also for the aesthetic appeal of the signs themselves in addition to their architectural quality different types of signs including allowable offpremise signs are intended to enhance the aesthetic quality of the development in several ways including but not limited to the following a mitigating and improving the appearance of normally unsightly parking structures by covering unattractive structure facades with attractive and aesthetically appealing signage b enhancing the appearance of bare walls of buildings c improving the appearance and adding interest to streetscapes parking areas sidewalks d creating an aesthetically pleasing grand entrance or gateway effect placement of signage at entryways into the development 3 the overall signage scheme in the pd34 zone with its variety in types of signs combined with the unique architecture style light color and electronic display is designed to create a visual experience and a sense of excitement energy and vibrancy that cannot be achieved or replicated on smaller individual parcels this will enhance the quality of the pd34 zone as a destination and gathering place for consumers in

 enacted   amended   amended   amended  22132 purpose the purposes of this ordinance are a to regulate personal wireless services antennas and related electronic equipment and structures enacted   amended   amended   amended  b to provide for the orderly establishment of personal wireless services facilities in the city enacted   amended   amended  city of orem ut  c to minimize the number of antenna support structures by encouraging the use of stealth facilities by encouraging the colocation of multiple antennas on a single structure by encouraging the location of antennas on preexisting support structures and by encouraging the use of cityowned property for antenna support structures enacted   amended   amended  d to establish siting appearance and safety standards that will help mitigate potential impacts related to the construction use and maintenance of personal wireless services facilities enacted   amended   amended  e to comply with the telecommunications act of 1996 by establishing regulations that 1 do not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services 2 do not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services and 3 are not based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the federal communication commissions regulations concerning such emissions enacted   amended   amended  22133 findings the city council makes the following findings a personal wireless services devices are an integral part of the rapidly growing and evolving telecommunications industry and present unique zoning challenges and concerns for the city enacted   amended   amended  b the city needs to balance the interests and desires of the telecommunications industry and its customers to provide competitive and effective telecommunications systems in the city against the sometimes differing interests and desires of others concerning health safety welfare and aesthetics and orderly planning of the community enacted   amended   amended  c the city has experienced an increased demand for personal wireless services facilities to be located in the city and expects the increased demand to continue into the future enacted   amended   amended  d it is in the best interests of the city to have quality personal wireless services available which necessarily entails the erection of personal wireless services facilities in the city enacted   amended   amended  e the unnecessary proliferation of personal wireless services facilities throughout the city creates a negative visual impact on the community enacted   amended   amended  f the visual effects of personal wireless services facilities can be mitigated by fair standards regulating their siting construction maintenance and use city of orem ut  enacted   amended   amended  g the city owns numerous large parcels of property evenly spread throughout the city where personal wireless services facilities can be located so as to be as inoffensive as possible to the residents and businesses of the city enacted   amended   amended   amended  h spacing personal wireless services facilities evenly throughout the city reduces the negative impact created by the proliferation of telecommunication towers enacted   amended   amended  i because of the height and appearance of some personal wireless services facilities surrounding properties bear a disproportionate share of the negative impacts of a telecommunications tower enacted   amended   amended  j a private property owner who leases space for a personal wireless services facility is the only one who receives compensation for the facility even though numerous other property owners in the area are adversely affected by the location of the facility enacted   amended   amended  k encouraging personal wireless services facilities to be located on city property with lease payments paid to the city instead of an individual property owner indirectly compensates all citizens of the community for the adverse impacts of the facilities and is therefore the fairest method of distributing burden and benefit enacted   amended   amended   amended  l locating antennas on existing buildings and structures or constructing an antenna as a stealth facility creates less of a negative visual impact on the community than the erection of towers enacted   amended   amended  m buildings and structures on public property are capable of being used to provide support for antenna arrays thus reducing the proliferation of towers in all areas of the city enacted   amended   amended  n the public policy objectives to reduce the proliferation of telecommunication towers and to mitigate their impact can best be facilitated by encouraging the use of less visually intrusive antennas and permitting the locating of wireless communication systems on telecommunication towers and antenna support structures that are located on property owned leased or used by the city enacted   amended   amended   amended  o the requirements set forth in this ordinance for the placement of personal wireless services facilities on property owned leased or used by the city are necessary to protect the health safety and general welfare of the community city of orem ut  enacted   amended   amended   amended  p utah grants cities the authority to create or acquire sites to accommodate the erection of telecommunication towers in order to promote the location of telecommunication towers in a manageable area and to protect the aesthetics and environment of the area the law also allows the city to require the owner of any tower to accommodate the multiple use of the tower by other companies where feasible and to pay the city the fair market rental value for the use of any cityowned site enacted   amended   amended  22134 definitions the following words shall have the described meaning when used in this unless

in the cxdc zone if at least 50% of a parcels street frontage is occupied by buildings that meet the maximum setback requirement of subsection f2 below and have pedestrian access to the street at ground level a building on the interior of the parcel may exceed the maximum residential glfa limit by an amount equal to the amount in square feet by which the residential glfa of buildings meeting the maximum setback requirement on the same parcel is below the maximum residential glfa allowed in such buildings this transfer of allowable residential occupancy may only be made to interior buildings and buildings with street frontage may in no case exceed the maximum residential glfa requirement any such transfer shall be recorded upon a plat and recorded at the office of the utah county recorder upon the execution of such a transfer of allowable residential occupancy residential uses in the building that transferred a portion of its allowable residential use percentage shall not exceed the maximum percentage city of orem ut  of glfa allowed by the applicable zone less the amount of residential glfa that was transferred to another building for example if a parcel in the cxdc zone has two buildings that each contain 50000 square feet of glfa and at least 50% of the street frontage of said parcel is occupied by a building that meets the maximum setback requirements the interior building could be 100% occupied by residential uses provided that no more than 30000 square feet of glfa of the building fronting the street was occupied by residential uses and the transfer of 10000 square feet of residential occupancy from the building with street frontage to the building on the interior of the lot was shown on a plat recorded with the utah county recorder following the

limit by an amount equal to the amount in square feet by which the residential glfa of buildings meeting the maximum setback requirement on the same parcel is below the maximum residential glfa allowed in such buildings this transfer of allowable residential occupancy may only be made to interior buildings and buildings with street frontage may in no case exceed the maximum residential glfa requirement any such transfer shall be recorded upon a plat and recorded at the office of the utah county recorder upon the execution of such a transfer of allowable residential occupancy residential uses in the building that transferred a portion of its allowable residential use percentage shall not exceed the maximum percentage of glfa allowed by the applicable zone less the amount of residential glfa that was transferred to another building for example if a parcel in the city of orem ut  adc zone has two buildings that each contain 50000 square feet of glfa and at least 50% of the street frontage of said parcel is occupied by a building that meets the maximum setback requirements the interior building could be 100% occupied by residential uses provided that no more than 30000

growth that has becn experienced in recent years the current student population of 22000 students could reach 30000 by 2005 orems student housing needs have been absorbed by communities around the valley but provo has borne more than its share of the increased demand students seeking affordable housing and the religious social atmosphere associated with byu have gravitated toward the many student apartment complexes in provo 1 see article titled provo good place for business by anne golden the daily herald  appendix a 2 as quoted in uvsc looks at housing concerns by steven gardner the
