bodies no less frequently than every five years in order to determine whether in light of current land development trends there should be a transfer of all or any part of such areas to some other appropriate use district any such review will consider the need for permitting other uses on such land the nature of the use or uses to be permitted and the cost and availability of the public

permitted by the committee by issuance of a conditional use permit pursuant to section 74187 an application for such a permit shall include a survey of the lot providing the following information  location of parking topography of the land existing vegetation proposed cutting and proposed replanting the committee may grant such a permit only if it finds that such special vegetation removal plans a will not cause undue erosion or destruction of scenic beauty  and b will provide substantial visual screening from the water of dwellings accessory structures and parking areas where the plan calls for replacement plantings the commission may require the submission of a bond which guarantees the performance of the planned tree or shrubbery replacement by the lot owner and c will provide a

shall apply to the construction of any impervious surface that increases the percent of impervious surface that is or will be located within 300 feet of the ordinary high water mark of any navigable waterway on any of the following a a riparian lot or parcel b a nonriparian lot or parcel that is located entirely within 300 feet of the ordinary highwater mark of any navigable waterway 2 calculation percentage of impervious surface shall be calculated by dividing the surface area of the existing and proposed impervious surfaces on the lot or parcel by the total surface area of that lot or parcel and multiplying by 100 treated impervious surfaces described in 9 below may be excluded from the calculation where the property owner can show that the runoff from the impervious surface is treated by devices such as storm water ponds constructed wetlands infiltration basins rain gardens bioswales or other engineered systems or that the runoff discharges to internally drained pervious area that retains the runoff on or off the parcel to allow infiltration into the soil if an outlot lies between the ordinary high water mark and the developable lot or parcel and both are in common ownership the lot or parcel and the outlot shall be considered one lot or parcel for the purposes of calculating the percentage of impervious surfaces for properties that have been condominiumized the impervious surface calculations apply to the entire property the property is still under one legal description and the proposed expansion to a unit is not the only impervious surface calculated since the regulation states lot or parcel and not a unit mitigation applies to the property as a whole and not just to the portion of the frontage that might be in front of the unit impacted 3 general impervious surface standards a general standard except as allowed below and except for those lawfully existing impervious surfaces a lot or parcel is allowed up to 15% impervious surface as calculated
