purposes a statutory authorization 1 approval of draft article by kansas chief engineer prior to adoption the following floodplain management regulations as written were approved in draft form by the chief engineer of the division of water resources of the kansas department of agriculture on  2 kansas statutory authorization the legislature of the state of kansas has in ksa 12741 et seq and specifically in ksa 12766 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare therefore the city commission of iola kansas ordains as follows b findings of fact 1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of iola kansas are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto b calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood c computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in section 106146b1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 federal regulations cfr 5922a3  and to meet the requirements of 44 cfr 603d and kar 5444 by applying the provisions of this article to 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities that serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction  and 3 protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard  4411 general provisions a lands to which article applies this article shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of iola kansas identified as numbered and unnumbered a zones ae ao and ah zones on the index map dated  of the flood insurance rate map firm and any future revisions thereto in all areas covered by the article no development shall be permitted except thereto in all areas covered by this article no development shall be permitted except issuance of a floodplain development permit granted by the city commission or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the city commission or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare health of the inhabitants of the community and as specifically noted in section 106149 provisions for flood hazard reduction b compliance no development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located extended converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations c abrogation and greater restrictions it is not intended by this article to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this article imposes greater restrictions the provisions of this article shall prevail all other ordinances inconsistent with this article are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only d interpretation in their interpretation and application the provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum requirements shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by kansas statutes e warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris this article does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage this article shall not create a liability on the part of the city any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made there under f

there are uses structures lots signs and other current circumstances that were lawful prior to the effective date of this unified development would now be prohibited regulated or restricted under the provisions of this unified development instances are considered nonconformities the purpose of this article is to establish regulations that govern these nonconforming uses structures lots signs and other current circumstances b applicability the regulations of this article shall apply to the following types of nonconformities 1 nonconforming uses uses legally established prior to the effective date of this unified development do not conform with the use regulations of the district that the use is located are referred to as nonconforming uses temporary uses shall not qualify as nonconforming uses 2 nonconforming structures buildings and structures not including signs legally established prior to the effective date of this unified development do not conform with the property development standards of the zoning district that the use is located in are referred to as nonconforming structures temporary structures shall not qualify as nonconforming structures 3 nonconforming lots any lot having insufficient area width or depth for the zoning district in which it is located which was legally platted and recorded prior to the effective date of this unified development referred to as a nonconforming lot 4 nonconforming signs signs legally established prior to the effective date of this unified development do not conform to the sign regulations are referred to as nonconforming signs temporary signs shall not qualify as nonconforming signs 5 other nonconformities other situations which were legally established prior to the effective date of this unified development but do not conform to the regulations of this unified development including but not limited to 1 fence height or location  2 lack of or inadequate landscape buffers  3 lack of or inadequate landscaping  lack of or inadequate offstreet parking  and 4 other nonconformities not involving zoning district use or property development standards are referred to as other nonconformities c policy it is the general policy of the city to allow uses structures lots signs and other situations that came into existence legally and in conformance with thenapplicable requirements but that do not conform to all of the applicable requirements of this unified development continue to exist and be put to productive use but to bring as many aspects of such circumstance into conformance with this unified development is reasonably practicable all subject to the limitations of this article the limitations of this article are intended to recognize the interests of the property owner in continuing to use the property but to control the expansion of the nonconformity and to control reestablishment of abandoned uses and limit reestablishment of buildings and structures that have been substantially destroyed d authority to continue nonconformities shall be allowed to continue in accordance with the regulations of this article e determination of nonconformity status the burden of establishing that a nonconformity lawfully exists is to the owner and not the city f repair and maintenance repairs and normal maintenance required to keep nonconforming structures and nonconforming signs in a safe condition shall be permitted provided that no alterations shall be made except those allowed by this article or required by law or ordinance g change of tenancy or ownership changes of tenancy ownership or management of an existing nonconformity shall be permitted provided there is no change in the nature or character extent or intensity of such nonconformity nonconforming uses nonconforming uses shall be subject to the following standards a enlargement no nonconforming use shall be enlarged expanded or extended to occupy a greater area of land or floor areas than was occupied on the effective date of this unified development no additional accessory use building or structure shall be established on the site of a nonconforming use this provision notwithstanding uses may be extended throughout any part of a building or other structure that was lawfully and manifestly designed or arranged for such use prior to the effective date of this unified development

into which it is moved c discontinuance and abandonment if a nonconforming use ceases for any reason for a period of more than six consecutive months except where government action causes such cessation the subsequent use of such parcel or lot shall conform to the regulations and provisions set by this unified development the district that such parcel or lot is located when a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use the nonconforming use shall not be resumed d damage or destruction in the event that any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of more than 50 percent of its structural value prior to such destruction such structure shall not be restored unless such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district that it is located the city shall make the determination of such reduced structural valuation when such damage or destruction is 50 percent or less no repair or restoration shall be made unless a building permit is obtained within six months of the damage or destruction and restoration is completed within one year after the date that such permit is issued the time limit may be extended upon the recommendation of the planning commission and the approval of city commission e change in use a nonconforming use may be changed to a new use provided that the new use shall be of the same general character or of a character less intensive and thus more closely conforming than the existing nonconforming use the planning director shall make the initial determination of whether a proposed use is a conforming use or is less intense with an appeal to the board of zoning appeals a nonconforming use may not thereafter be changed back to a less conforming use than what it was changed from f residential uses in nonresidential districts the other provisions of this section notwithstanding any structure that is devoted to a nonconforming residential use and that is located in a co or more intensive district may be remodeled extended expanded and enlarged  provided that after any such remodeling extension expansion or enlargement such structure shall not be used to accommodate a greater number of dwelling or lodging units than such structure accommodated prior to any such work a structure being used for a nonconforming residential use may be rebuilt for residential purposes in the event of damage or destruction as defined in section 160161d damage or destruction regardless of the percent of the damage or destruction provided a building permit is obtained within one year of the damage or destruction g accessory uses no use that is an accessory to a principal nonconforming use shall continue after such principal use ceases or terminates nonconforming structures nonconforming structures shall be subject to the following standards a enlargement any expansion of a nonconforming structure that increases the degree of nonconformance shall be prohibited other expansions of the structure shall be permitted and shall not require a variance the planning director shall make the initial determination of whether a proposed expansion increases the degree of nonconformity with an appeal to the board of zoning appeals b relocation nonconforming structures shall not be moved unless the movement or relocation will bring the structure into compliance with all applicable zoning district regulations c damage or destruction in the event that any nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of more than 50 percent of its structural value prior to such destruction such structure shall not be restored except in conformance with the regulations for the zoning district that it is located when a structure is damaged to the extent of 50 percent or less no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a building permit is obtained within six months of the damage or destruction and restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial destruction and is diligently pursued to completion the city shall make the determination of such reduced structural valuation nonconforming lots nonconforming lots shall be subject to the following standards a alteration no nonconforming lot or any portion thereof shall be altered used or sold in a manner that would increase its degree of nonconformity b singlefamily residential construction the planning director may issue a building permit for a singlefamily residential home on any
