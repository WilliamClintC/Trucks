article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing within this jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact above this article seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives a development of real property and associated increases in site impervious surfaces often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species c clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat improper clearing of vegetation and burial of vegetative and other wastes can result in unstable soil conditions and the production of noxious gases of said wastes d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation e substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality f stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development activities g the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from real property activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety h regulation of development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development  285136 vehicles storage of
