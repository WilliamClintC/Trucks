designed primarily for rural areas many years ago is no longer suitable for the town of amherst this has been caused by rapid population growth urban expansion and the attendant increase in the demand for urban services plus the complexity and scale of both administrative and fiscal burdens on the town government b executive and administrative responsibilities are presently allocated among and in many cases shared by a variety of elective and appointive officials c there is a need for the formulation of new legislative policies which would help the town to adjust to the phenomena of urban growth this produces heavy demands on the time and energies of the members of the town board as a result an evergrowing volume of details concerning daytoday government operations compete for their attention d the existing system by which committees of the town board and the supervisor assume responsibilities for and at times undertake the performance of routine administrative tasks has resulted in a diffusion of command and on occasions conflicting directives to subordinate officers and employees causing diffusion of accountability diminution of morale of the towns work force impairment of management and operational efficiency and a waste of the towns resources e the desired effect of this chapter is to improve the efficiency of the town government by separating the executive and legislative responsibilities of the town board and the supervisor and to develop a coherent departmental structure which will properly interrelate and organize the functions of the various administrative agencies and officers of the town a concomitant objective of this chapter is to enhance the capacity of the town board to perform its legislative functions principally by relieving its committees of administrative burdens so as to enable them to devote their resources to the demanding tasks of formulating legislative policies while at the same time retaining and facilitating the town boards function of legislative oversight of the activities of the executive branch f the principal purpose of this chapter is to provide the foundation for the development of an executive branch separate from the legislative body g initially this chapter establishes central management departments of the executive branch but anticipates that based on studies and recommendations by the supervisor and town board additional  41 general provisions  41   42 title this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the amherst government organization law  43 definitions as used in this

tied together and adjusted using gps units to achieve extremely accurate coordinate values from these observations the datum computed and adjusted coordinate values are published locally and adopted herein by the town board ngs standard networks produce one single unified reference system for horizontal and vertical control work within the town encouraging uniform use sharing and efficient transfer of geospatial data necessary quality control is provided and upheld between all associates and users additional field work adjustments and identification are continually undertaken to further density expand and update the towns network b the perimeter of the town is approximately 32 miles long encompassing almost 54 square miles in area establishing the need for a system of permanent horizontal and vertical control to provide a common basis for surveying and mapping operations permanent geodetic control points were set on an approximate spacing of one mile within the town these points consist of a berntsen top security rod monument system of which 71 were installed to ngs specifications for first order control points in addition 6 ngs published first order control stations 13 ngs published second order control stations 7 ngs azimuth stations 13 previously established nys dot and five existing ecdpw highway division control points were recovered reused and the coordinate values updated the integrity of each existing control point was verified before integration into the town network c this newly established reference system or datum is a set of numerical quantities

16088 amherst code  16089  sex offenders registration of  1631 title the title of this chapter shall be the sexual offenders registration act  1632 legislative findings and intent a the town board of the town of amherst finds that one of the highest priorities of local government is the protection of the health and safety of its citizens this is especially true for children and other vulnerable members of society the town board further finds that convicted sex offenders pose a significant continuing risk to society moreover as the tragic murder of jessica lunsford in florida in spring 2005 and other such events have shown recidivism among convicted sexual offenders is a continuing problem b recently residents of the town have been advised that there are residing in town a number of convicted sex offenders at least some of these sex offenders have registered as required by c of the correction law of the state of new york commonly known as megans law some of these individuals have been categorized by the state department of corrections as level ii sex offenders who have been determined to be of moderate risk of committing another sex crime some of these individuals have been categorized as level iii sex offenders who have been determined to be of a high risk to commit another sexual crime however the town board finds that some sex offenders fail to register or fail to update their registration information when they move from one location to another c the town board finds that the protection of the victims and potential victims of sexual offenders in amherst is a matter of unique local concern not fully and adequately addressed by state law the town board finds that the disclosures required and the limitations contained herein will protect the citizens of amherst and will provide to employers who contract with amherst information that will assist these employers in protecting children who may come into proximity with a sex offender in the scope of employment d the town board finds that the town of amherst has not assessed and can not assess the risk of recidivism of any particular sex offender or class of sex offenders and has made no determination of dangerousness of any particular sex offender or class of sex offenders rather the board finds that this chapter is remedial in nature and designed to fill certain gaps in state law as well as to provide protections for residents of the town who receive certain services from the town the board further finds this chapter to be the most narrowly tailored means of fulfilling its compelling interest in the safety of its citizens finally the  16089 general provisions  1632   1633 definitions for purposes of this chapter the following shall apply unless the context clearly

the purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing within this jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in  17220 hereof this article seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives a land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species c clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality g stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities h the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety i regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development

residential types and nonresidential uses and services a new community district ncd may contain both individual building sites and common property which are planned and developed as a unit among the purposes of this district are the encouragement of innovation in residential development so that the growing demand for housing at all economic levels may be met by greater variety in type design and siting of dwellings the conservation and more efficient use of land in such developments and the encouragement and maintenance of high environmental quality throughout the development this district encourages a similarly imaginative approach to the development of nonresidential uses in a ncd to encourage the most skillful planning of parts of the community in accordance with the objectives of the town master plan or its successors to provide for the utilization of planning criteria in the arrangements of buildings related to common open space to utilize topography and other site features to their best advantage and to obtain creative and coordinated designs it is necessary to expand the scope of land planning and development beyond a concept of homogeneous uses and structures on individual lots within formally defined districts to the planning and development of  51 amherst code  52  larger areas with groups of structures to create a diversified and coordinated entity

substantial real property tax productivity intended to support the financing of additional educational municipal and other public services required as a result of the development d convenience in location of commercial and service areas e the preservation of such features as trees outstanding natural topography and geological features  the prevention of soil erosion  and the comprehensive design of stormwater retention and proper drainage systems f a creative use of land and related physical development which allows an orderly transition of land from rural to urban uses g an efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets and lessened burden of traffic on streets and highways thereby lowering utility and maintenance costs borne by new development h creation and preservation of natural and manmade features which will give increased environmental quality encourage uses which will maintain high environmental quality and provide an attractive community design i guidance and control of development in flood hazard areas so that life and property both within and without such areas are protected j increased safety for all modes of travel
