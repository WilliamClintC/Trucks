resulted in a new generation of telecommunication services these new services transmit electromagnetic waves of such a frequency and power that will likely require numerous antenna locations these antennas may be located on buildings water towers and other similar structures but will also frequently be located on new or enlarged towers this requires that the town of suffield regulate wireless communication system facilities in a different manner than conventional television and radio transmission towers which are able to transmit their signals at much greater distances a number of providers of wireless communication services have recently been licensed by the federal communications commission and additional providers are expected to be licensed in the near future these firms are expected to pursue antenna sites within the town of suffield and these efforts are expected to include requests to construct new communication towers the intent of this proposed regulation is to provide for the establishment and or expansion of wireless telecommunication services within the town of suffield while protecting neighborhoods and minimizing the adverse visual and operational effects of wireless telecommunications facilities design sitting and screening more specifically this regulation has been developed in order to a maximize use of existing and approved towers and other
