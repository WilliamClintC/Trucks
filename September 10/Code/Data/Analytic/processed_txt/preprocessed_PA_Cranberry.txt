sexually oriented businesses and employees  13101 purpose and findings 251996 1 purpose a pursuant to the authority granted in the second class township prohibit nuisances  to promote the health cleanliness comfort and safety of the citizens of cranberry township  and to regulate the time of opening and closing and the conduct of places of public entertainment amusement and recreation the township of cranberry enacts this part to minimize and control the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of its citizens  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of blight b the board of supervisors has determined that locational criteria alone do not adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of the people of the township and that licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to insure that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to insure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation c the board of supervisors does not intend this part to suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment but to enact a content neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses 2 legislative findings a sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects which secondary effects should be regulated to protect the public health safety and welfare these secondary effects include but are not limited to the spread of communicable diseases performance of sexual acts in public places presence of discarded sexually oriented materials on public and private property sexual harassment obscenity prostitution and other illegal sexual activities crime and neighborhood deterioration b a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the township it is  13101 administration and government  13101  appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein c removal of doors on viewing booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths advances a substantial governmental interest in discouraging the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters d requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incident of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments e the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business limiting the adverse secondary effects of such businesses f it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this part is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity g the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this part h the barring of such individuals from the management of sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases i the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the township will be promoted by the enactment of this part j limitation of operating hours of sexually oriented businesses to  am to  pm mondays closure of such businesses on sundays and holidays reduces the adverse secondary effects of such businesses including particularly but not limited to late night noise levels crime and sexually offensive materials and activities in public areas and promotes the public health safety and welfare  13101 cranberry code  13102   13102 definitions 251996

appropriate exploratory excavations for the purpose of locating said lines 2 in all instances the costs associated with exploratory excavations shall be the responsibility of the contractor and any realignment of pipelines shall be approved by the township g existing utility lines  location protection and hazards 1 the plans show those underground water lines gas lines electric lines cable tv lines telephone lines sanitary sewers storm drains conduits and other similar utility lines and appurtenances for which said location information was either made available to the designer or was

and utilizing recreation open space are set forth at specific length in the townships recreation plan as amended and updated it is acknowledged and recognized that both residential and nonresidential uses of land in the township create a demand for facilities which require and utilize recreation open space nonresidential development whether standalone or part of a mixeduse development creates its own demands for usable recreation open space as individuals employed in the township couple their work activities with nonwork recreational activities within the township as a result of nonresidential development there is also an influx of business invitees and others who due to the proximity and availability of township recreation open space facilities utilize and will in the future utilize recreation open space facilities it is a vital township objective to ensure that as residential and nonresidential development continue usable and adequate  22503 cranberry code  22504  recreation open space which meets the townships open space design standards is developed and that existing facilities located within recreation open space are maintained and upgraded as needed 2 as a condition

nonresidential recreation fees or dedication of land in lieu of fee set forth in this chapter shall not apply to public schools or buildings associated therewith or to the township of cranberry any authority created by the township or any other township agency on the basis that schools and local government agencies serve an overriding public interest which warrants an exemption from nonresidential recreation fees or donation of land b finally the township has established this nonresidential recreation feededication of land requirement with the intent to promote the retention and utilization of recreation open space within the township for use by township residents and individuals employed in or visiting the township the amount of the applicable fee or dedication requirement corresponds to the square footage of the relevant nonresidential development and should bear a reasonable relationship to the typical expected increase in employee and business invitee traffic within the township and reduction of available recreation space within the township in the event that the township staff determines in its sole discretion that application of the nonresidential recreation fee or dedication of land requirement would be grossly disproportionate to the impact of a nonresidential development and in violation of applicable pennsylvania law the townships staff shall be empowered to recommend any modification it deems necessary to carry out the intent of this chapter  22504 administration and government  22504  design standards  22601 application of standards 21996
