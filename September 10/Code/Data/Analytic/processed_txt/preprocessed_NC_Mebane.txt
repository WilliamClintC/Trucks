feederbreeder operations d change in use 1 a substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character or nature of the activity conducted on a lot changes this occurs whenever a the change involves a change from one principal use category to another b if the original use is a combination use the relative proportion of space devoted to the individual principal uses that comprise the combination use changes to such an extent that the parking requirements for the overall use are altered c if the original use is a combination use the mixture of types of individual principal uses that comprise the combination use changes d if there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot regardless of whether that business or enterprise consists of one individual principal use or a combination use that mebane udo   amended            business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in even though the new business or enterprise may be classified under the same principal use or combination use category as the previous type of business for example if there is only one building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of that building moves out and is replaced by a clothing store that constitutes a change in use however if the florist shop were replaced by another florist shop that would not constitute a change in use since the type of business or enterprise would not have changed moreover if the florist shop moved out of a rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store that would not constitute a change in use since there is more than one business on the lot and the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot shopping centercombination use has not changed 2 a mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or viceversa does not constitute a change in use whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than 180 consecutive days or has been abandoned 3 a mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the name shall not be regarded as a change in use e combination uses 1 when a combination use comprises two or more principal uses that require different types of permits zoning or special use then the permit authorizing the combination use shall be a a special use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special use permit b a zoning permit in all other cases f mixed uses two or more permitted uses may occupy the same principal building g accessory uses 1 whenever an activity is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use i constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot or ii is customarily associated with the principal use and integrally related to it then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the mebane udo   amended            principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use 2 for purposes of interpreting subsection 1 above a a use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to the principal use  b to be customarily associated with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not but only that the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness 3 without limiting the generality of subsections 1 and 2 above the following activities are specifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses so long as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above a offices or

and the gwa overlay district represents the grahammebane lake public water supply watershed wsii balance of watershed area as designated by the nc environmental management commission the purpose of this to implement the provisions of the water supply watershed protection act ncgs 1432145 which requires the city of mebane to adopt minimum land use regulations consistent with the wsii critical area and balance of watershed management rules as adopted by the north carolina environmental management commission to protect the water quality of the grahammebane lake watershed located within the citys planning and zoning jurisdictional area b general provisions applicable to both watershed overlay districts 1 the construction of new roads and bridges and nonresidential development should minimize builtupon area divert stormwater away from surface water supply waters as much as possible and employ best management practices bmps to minimize water quality impacts to the extent

allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the general standard delineated in subsection d above the permitissuing authority may allow deviations for example when it finds that a residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly disabled or other population that demonstrates a lesser parking need or when it finds that a business or service is primarily oriented to walkin trade the permitissuing authority may also for example require additional overflow or visitor parking in cases where the proposed lot sizes are such that anticipated parking needs for occasional visitors can not be accommodated on individual lots whenever the permitissuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the requirements of table 641 it shall enter
