statement of findings the borough council of perkasie borough finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation degrades water quality overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the borough and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c through project design impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized to maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality groundwater recharge stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems the most costeffective and environmentally advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is project design minimizing impervious surfaces and sprawl avoiding sensitive areas ie stream buffers floodplains steep slopes and designing to topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime d inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens e the aforementioned impacts happen mainly decrease in natural infiltration of stormwater f stormwater is an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality g public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater h federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are  1581 snow and ice removal  1581   1582 purpose the purpose of this comprehensive stormwater management ordinance is to promote health safety and welfare within perkasie borough by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime and by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in  1581 of this chapter designed to required to obtain a federal permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes i nonstormwater discharges to municipal
