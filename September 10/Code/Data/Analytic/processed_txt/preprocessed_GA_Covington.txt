each separate dwelling unit is impracticable all service may be supplied single meter at the multiple residential service rate combined service so rendered shall not be submetered to the individual tenant the multiple residential rate is the only rate applicable to two or more separate dwelling units served single meter except as otherwise provided under the general service rate b the city will at any time upon request advise any customer as to the rate best adapted to existing or anticipated service requirements as defined by the customer but the city does not assume responsibility for the selection of such rate or for the continuance of the lowest annual cost under the rate selected should the volume or character of service change c a customer having selected a rate adapted to his service may not change to another rate within a twelve 12 month period unless there is a substantial change in the character or conditions of his service a new customer will be given reasonable

applicant for the express and sole purpose of endowing a permanent fund to offset continuing open space maintenance costs endowment funds should be twenty 20 times the annual amount estimated to be required to maintain the open space on the assumption that the sale of an additional lot over and above the maximum number that would ordinarily be permitted on the site would be without allocable development costs and would represent true profit seventyfive 75 percent of the net selling price of such lot shall be donated to the open space endowment fund for maintenance of the preserved lands within the subdivision such maintenance estimates shall be prepared by an agency or organization with experience in open space management acceptable to the planning commission the fund shall be transferred by the developer to a designated entity such as a homeowners association or a trustee approved by the planning commission 2 public access a ten 10 percent of the total land shall be dedicated for public use b the density bonus for open space that would be in addition to the ten 10 percent public land dedication shall be computed on the basis of a maximum of one dwelling unit for each five acres of open space dedicated for public use the decision as to whether to accept an applicants offer to dedicate open space for public use shall be within the discretion of the planning commission which shall be guided by the recommendations contained in the citys open space recreation and environmental resources plan particularly as said plan relates to trail networks andor recreational facilities 3 affordable housing a a density increase may be permitted where the conservation subdivision proposal provides onsite or offsite housing opportunities for low or moderate income families b the amount of the density increase shall be based on the following standard for each affordable housing unit provided under this section one additional building lot or dwelling unit shall be permitted up to a maximum fifteen 15 percent increase in dwelling units affordable housing is herein defined as units to be sold or rented to families earning seventy 70 to one hundred twenty 120 percent of the county median income adjusted for family size as determined by the us department of housing and urban development j minimum percentage of open space the minimum percentage of land that shall be designated as permanent open space not to be further subdivided and protected conservation easement held by the city or by a recognized land trust or conservancy shall be as specified below 1 a minimum of fifty 50 percent of the total tract area after deducting the following kinds of land that is undesirable for building purposes a wetlands ie land that is generally inundated land under ponds lakes creeks etc  b all of the floodway and floodway fringe within the hundredyear floodplain as shown on official fema maps  c land with slopes exceeding twentyfive 25 percent or with soil subject to slumping  d lands required for street rightsofway but not more than ten 10 percent of the net tract area  e land under permanent easement prohibiting future development including easements for drainage access and utilities  f the above areas shall generally be designated as undivided open areas in order to facilitate easement monitoring and enforcement and to promote appropriate management by a single entity according to approved management standards 2 at least twentyfive 25 percent of the minimum required open space shall be suitable for active recreation purposes but no more than fifty 50 percent shall be utilized for that purpose in order to preserve a reasonable proportion of natural areas on the site the purpose for which open space areas are proposed shall be documented by the applicant 3 the required open space may be used without restrictions for underground drainage fields for individual or community septic systems and for spray fields for spray irrigation purposes in a land application wastewater reclamation system these systems shall be limited to no more than ten 10 percent of the required minimum open space 4 stormwater management ponds or basins may be included as part of the minimum required open space as well as land within the rightofway for underground pipe lines however land within the rightofway of hightension power lines shall not be included as comprising part of the minimum required open space k location of open space the location of open space conserved residential development shall be consistent with the policies contained in the open space recreation and environmental resources element of the citys comprehensive plan the recommendations contained in this section and the evaluation criteria hereinafter set forth all undivided open space and any lot capable of further subdivision shall be restricted from further subdivision permanent conservation easement in a form acceptable to the city and duly recorded in the newton county deed records l classifications of open space open space shall be comprised of primary and secondary conservation areas both classes shall be protected by a permanent conservation easement prohibiting further development 1 primary conservation area this class consists of wetlands that are generally inundated under ponds lakes creeks etc lands within the hundredyear floodplain slopes exceeding twentyfive 25 percent and soils subject to slumping these sensitive lands shall be deducted from the total parcel acreage to produce the adjusted tract acreage on which density shall be based 2 secondary conservation area in addition to the primary conservation areas at least fifty 50 percent of the remaining land shall be designated as permanently protected full density credit shall be allowed for land in this category that would otherwise be buildable under local regulations so that its development potential is not reduced by this designation greater latitude exists in the designation of secondary conservation areas except that they shall include a one hundred 100 foot greenway buffer along all water bodies and watercourses and a fifty 50 foot greenway buffer alongside wetlands soils classified as very poorly drained in the medium intensity county soil survey the location of secondary conservation areas shall be guided by the maps and policies contained in the open space recreation and environmental resources element of the citys comprehensive plan and shall typically include all or part of the following kinds of resources a mature woodlands  b areas with highly permeable excessively drained soil  c significant wildlife habitat areas  d scenic views into the property from existing public roads  and e secondary conservation areas therefore typically consist of upland forest meadows pastures and farm fields as a part of the ecologically connected matrix of natural areas significant for wildlife habitat and water quality protection although the resource lands listed as potential secondary conservation areas may comprise more than half of the remaining land on a development parcel after primary conservation areas have been deducted no applicant shall be required to designate more than fifty 50 percent of that remaining land as a secondary conservation area 3 general location standards subdivisions and planned residential developments shall be designed around both the primary and secondary conservation areas which together constitute the total required open space the design process should therefore commence with the delineation of all potential open space after which potential house sites are located both primary and secondary conservation areas shall be placed in undivided preserves which may adjoin housing areas that have been designed more compactly to create larger areas that may be enjoyed equally by all residents of the development 4 undivided open space shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable number of lots within a conservation subdivision the majority of house lots should abut undivided open space in order to provide direct views and access safe and convenient pedestrian access to the open space from all lots not adjoining the open space shall be provided except such areas that are specifically designed as village greens ball fields upland buffers to wetlands water bodies watercourses or trail links 5 interconnected open space network the protected open spaces in each new subdivision will eventually adjoin each other ultimately forming an interconnected network of primary and secondary conservation areas m evaluation criteria in evaluating the layout of lots and open space the following criteria will be considered by the planning commission as indicating design appropriate to the sites natural historic and cultural features and meeting the purposes of this section diversity and originality in lot layout shall be encouraged to achieve the best possible relationship between development and conservation areas accordingly the planning commission shall evaluate proposals to determine whether the proposed conceptual preliminary plan 1 protects and preserves all floodplains wetlands and steep slopes from clearing grading filling or construction except as may be approved by the city for essential infrastructure or recreation amenities  2 preserves and maintains mature woodlands existing fields pastures meadows and orchards and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses locating house lots and driveways within wooded areas is generally recommended except where such location a involves significant wildlife habitat or mature woodlands that raise an equal or greater preservation concern as described in subsections m5 and m8 of this section b involves predominantly agricultural areas where remnant tree groups provide the only natural areas for wildlife habitat  3 if development must be located on open fields or pastures because of greater constraints in all other parts of the site the following must apply a dwellings should be sited on the least desirable agricultural soils or in locations at the far edge of a field as seen from existing public roads and b the development should be visually buffered from existing public roads such as by a planting screen consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees shrubs and wildflowers  4 maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural native species vegetation of at least one hundred 100 feet in depth adjacent to wetlands and surface waters including creeks streams springs lakes and ponds  5 designs around existing hedgerow and tree lines between fields or meadows and minimizes impacts on large woodlands in poor condition with limited management potential which can provide suitable locations for residential developments when any woodland is developed great care shall be taken to design all disturbed areas for buildings roads yards etc in locations where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas to the fullest extent that is practicable  6 leaves scenic views and vistas open for uninterrupted viewing particularly as seen from public thoroughfare utilizing the following criteria a in open agrarian landscapes a deep nobuild noplant buffer is recommended along any public thoroughfare where those views or vistas are prominent or locally significant b the concept of foreground meadows with homes facing the public thoroughfare across a broad grassy expanse is strongly preferred to mere buffer strips with or without berms or vegetative screening and c in wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained a deep nobuilt nocut buffer should be respected to preserve existing vegetation  7 avoids siting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges by taking advantage of lower topography feature  8 protects wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered threatened or of special concern  9 designs around and preserves sites of historic archaeological or cultural value and their environment insofar as needed to safeguard the character of the feature including stone walls spring houses barns foundations cellar holes earthworks and burial grounds  10 protects rural roadside character and improves public safety and vehicular carrying capacity by avoiding development fronting directly onto existing public streets and establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridors or rural roads with historic buildings stone walls hedgerows or other significant features  11 landscapes common areas in compliance with the citys tree ordinance such as culdesac islands and both sides of new streets with native species shade trees and flowering shrubs with high wildlife conservation value  12 provides active recreational areas in suitable locations that offer convenient access by residents and adequate screening from nearby house lots  13 includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site between properties and activities or special features within the neighborhood open space system all roadside footpaths should connect with offroad trails which in turn should link with potential open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels  14 provides open space that is reasonably contiguous utilizing the following criteria a fragmentation of open space should be minimized so that these resource areas are not divided into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the development b conservation land shall be designed as a single block with logical straightforward boundaries long thin strips of conservation land shall be avoided unless the conservation feature is linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other streams and trails c open spaces shall generally abut existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels such subdivision open space shall be designed as part of larger contiguous and integrated greenway systems as set forth in the open space recreation and environmental resources element of the citys comprehensive plan n conservation village design site planning procedures the following sequence of procedural steps prescribed in this chapter shall be followed in the order listed and may be combined only at the discretion of the planning commission 1 preapplication discussion a preapplication discussion is strongly encouraged between the applicant the site designer and the planning commission the purpose of this meeting is to introduce the applicant and the site designer to the city zoning and subdivision regulations and procedures and to discuss the applicants objectives in relation to the citys policies and code requirements 2 existing features site analysis plan plans analyzing each sites special features are required for all proposed cvdd subdivisions as they form the basis of the design process for greenway lands house locations street alignments and lot lines the applicant or hisher representative shall bring a copy of the existing features site analysis plan to the onsite walking inspections such site analysis plans must include at least a a contour map based upon topographical maps published by the us geological survey  b the location of severely constraining elements such as steep slopes over twentyfive 25 percent wetlands watercourses intermittent streams one hundred 100 year floodplain and all rightofway easements  c soil boundaries as shown on usda natural resources conservation service medium intensity maps  d the location of significant features such as woodlands tree lines open fields or meadows scenic views into or out from the property watershed divides drainage ways fences stone walls rock outcrops existing structures roads tracks and trails  e these existing features shall identify both primary conservation areas floodplains wetlands and steep slopes as defined in the process for computing adjusted tract acreage and secondary conservation areas as described in subsection l2 of this section together these primary and secondary conservation areas comprise the developments proposed open space the location of which shall be consistent with the citys comprehensive plan the site analysis plan shall form the basis for the conceptual preliminary plan which shall show the tentative location of houses streets lot lines and greenway lands in new subdivisions according to the fourstep design process described in subsection n7 of this section 3 onsite walking inspection by planning commission and applicant after the site analysis plan has been prepared the planning commission shall schedule a mutually convenient date to walk the property with the applicant and the applicants site designer the purpose of this visit is to familiarize city officials with the propertys special features and to provide them with an opportunity to offer guidance to the applicant regarding the tentative location of secondary conservation areas and potential house locations and street alignments if the visit is not scheduled before submission of the sketch plan or the conceptual preliminary plan it should occur soon thereafter 4 presubmission conference prior to the submission of the sketch plan or a conceptual preliminary plan the applicant shall meet with the planning commission to discuss how the fourstep approach to designing subdivision described in subsection n7 of this section could be applied to the subject property at the discretion of the planning commission this conference may be combined with the onsite walking inspection 5 conceptual preliminary plan after the presubmission conference a sketch plan or a conceptual preliminary plan shall be submitted for any proposed cvdd subdivision as used in this section the term conceptual preliminary plan refers to a preliminary engineered sketch plan drawn to illustrate initial thoughts about a conceptual layout for greenway lands house sites and street alignments at this stage are tentatively illustrated before premature engineering costs are incurred in the design of any proposed subdivision layout conceptual preliminary plans shall be prepared by a team that includes a landscape architect and a civil engineer this plan shall be submitted by the applicant to the city zoning official who will then submit it to the planning commission for review for the purpose of securing early agreement on the overall pattern of streets house lots primary and secondary conservation areas and potential trail linkages prior to any significant expenditures for engineering the street design stormwater management or accurate delineation of internal lot boundaries 6 within thirty 30 days of receiving the conceptual preliminary plan the planning commission shall approve disapprove or approve it with conditions stating the reasons for its decision in writing the remaining sixty 60 days of the statutory ninety 90 day review period for preliminary plans shall be utilized by the applicant to submit a detailed preliminary plan which shall contain all the customary engineering data and for the planning commission to review said plan and to render its decision in writing either or both of these time periods may be formally extended if mutually agreeable to the applicant and the planning commission 7 fourstep process each conceptual preliminary plan shall follow a fourstep design process as described below when the conceptual preliminary plan is submitted the applicant shall be prepared to demonstrate to the planning commission that these four design steps were followed by their site designers in determining the layout of their proposed streets house lots and greenway lands this process shall be accomplished during the first thirty 30 days of the statutory ninety 90 day review period for preliminary plans a designating the open spaces during the first step all potential conservation areas both primary and secondary are identified using the site analysis plan guidance on which parts of the remaining land to classify as secondary conservation areas shall be based upon i onsite visits or walking inspections  ii the open space location criteria contained in subsection l3 of this section  b the evaluation criteria listed in subsection m of this section  c information from published data and reports  and d conversation with existing or recent owners of the property and members of the mayor and council and planning commission 8 location of house sites during the second step potential house sites are tentatively located because the proposed locations of houses within each lot represents a significant decision with potential impacts on the ability of the development to meet the evaluation criteria contained in subsection u of this section subdivision applicants shall identify tentative house sites on the conceptual preliminary plan and proposed house sites on the detailed final plan house sites should generally be located not closer than one hundred 100 feet from primary conservation areas but may be situated within fifty 50 feet of secondary conservation areas in order to enjoy views of the latter without negatively impacting the former the building footprint of proposed residences may be changed by more than fifty 50 feet in any direction with majority approval of the planning commission such changes involving less than fifty 50 feet do not require such approval 9 street and lot layout the third step consists of aligning proposed streets to provide vehicular access to each house in the most reasonable and economical way when lots and access streets are laid out they shall be located in a way that avoids or at least minimizes adverse impacts on the primary and secondary conservation areas to the greatest extent practicable wetland crossings and streets traversing existing slopes of over fifteen 15 percent shall be strongly discouraged street connections shall generally be encouraged to minimize the number of new culdesacs to be maintained by the city and to facilitate easy access to and from homes in different parts of the property and on adjoining parcels where culdesacs are necessary those serving six or fewer homes may be designed with a hammerhead configuration facilitating threepoint turns culdesacs serving more than six homes shall generally be designed with a central island containing indigenous trees and shrubs either conserved on site or planted on site in a cvd where more formal neotraditional or village type layouts are proposed the preceding steps two and three may be reversed so that the location of house sites follows the location of streets and squares 10 lot lines the fourth step is to draw in the lot lines they are generally drawn midway between house locations and may include lshaped flag lots meeting the citys minimum standard codes for the same o preliminary engineering certification prior to approval of the conceptual preliminary plan the applicant shall submit to the planning commission a preliminary engineering certification from a georgia licensed professional engineer that the approximate layout of proposed streets house lots and open space lands complies with the citys zoning and subdivision ordinances particularly those

ordinance ch 1548 pertained to similar subject matter see also the table and disposition list statutory authorization findings of fact purpose and objectives   authorization of the constitution of the state of georgia and a of the official georgia annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governments to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the mayor and council of the city of covington georgia do ordain as follows 5   findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city of covington georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in flood plains causing increases in flood height and velocities 5   statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  b restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  c control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  d prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and e control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters 5   objectives the objectives of this chapter are a to protect human life and health  b to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  c to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  d to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  e to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  f to minimize prolonged business interruptions  g to ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area 5 general provisions   definitions unless

mayor and council of the city find that airport hazards endanger the lives and property of users of the covington municipal airport and the property and occupants of land in its vicinity such hazards may also reduce the area available for utilization by aircraft thus impairing the utility of the airport and the public investment therein it is therefore appropriate for the city to provide by ordinance for the prevention and control of airport hazards in the interest of the public health safety and general welfare b airport zone in order to carry out the provisions of this section there is created and established an overlay zone incorporating all of the land lying within the approach zones transitional zones horizontal zones and conical zones of the airport such zones are shown on the airport hazard zoning map including the approach and profile plan maps on file at city hall and the planning and zoning office which map is by this reference incorporated herein and made a part hereof any area located in more than one zone shall be considered to be in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation the airport zones are described as follows 1 nonprecision instrument approach zone the inner edge of this zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is five hundred 500 feet wide the approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of three thousand five hundred 3500 feet at a horizontal distance of ten thousand 10000 feet from either end of the primary surface its centerline is the centerline of the runway as extended in either direction from the ends of the airport runway 2 transitional zone the area beneath a plane extending outward and upward at ninety 90 degree angles to the runway centerline and the extended runway centerline with a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical planes and extending a distance of five thousand 5000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach zones and at ninety 90 degree angles to the extended runway centerline 3 horizontal zone a zone delineated by arcs of five thousand 5000 feet in radius for all runways designated as utility or visual and ten thousand 10000 feet in radius for all others measured from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs 4 conical zone an area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of four thousand 4000 feet the conical zone does not include the precision instrument approach zones or the transitional zones c airport height limitations except as otherwise provided in this section no structure or tree shall be erected altered allowed to grow or maintained in the space within an airport zone or otherwise to a height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for such zone when more than one height limitation is applicable to a single space the more restrictive limitation shall apply 1 runway larger than a utility runway with a visibility greater than threefourths mile nonprecision instrument approach zone slopes upward thirtyfour 34 feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of ten thousand 10000 feet along the extended runway centerline 2 transitional zone one hundred fifty 150 feet above the airport elevation 3 horizontal zone one hundred fifty 150 feet above the airport elevation 4 conical zone slopes upward and outward twenty 20 feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at one hundred fifty 150 feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of three hundred fifty 350 feet above the airport elevation 5 military conical zones slopes upward and outward twenty 20 feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone for a distance of four thousand 4000 feet d use restrictions  all zones notwithstanding any other provisions of this section no use may be made of land or water within any zone in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights result in glare in the eyes of a pilot using the airport impair visibility in the vicinity of
