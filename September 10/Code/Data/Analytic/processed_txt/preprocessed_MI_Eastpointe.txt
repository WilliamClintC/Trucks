elevated heart rates increased blood pressure vomiting and disorientation evidencing that these herbal incense products are harmful if consumed and present an imminent and significant public health danger to persons consuming such products and other persons coming in contact with them c the city further finds that notwithstanding the high potential for abuse and lack of any accepted medical use the ability of the state to prohibit all forms of synthetic marijuana as a controlled substance has been frustrated due to the changing nature of the chemicals used in the manufacturing process d the city further finds that in addition to synthetic marijuana there may be other products or materials containing chemicals or substances that while not approved for human consumption are or may be marketed and sold in a form that allows for such consumption and which upon consumption may result in the same serious side effects and public health dangers as synthetic marijuana e based on these

businesses industries governmental and charitable agencies and residents located in the city need to have potable and otherwise usable water b availability of potable water the city council further has previously found and currently reaffirms that the supply of potable water available from private wells within the city is insufficient to ensure that all businesses industries governmental and charitable agencies and residents will have sufficient potable water available for their use and other water necessary for industrial and fire prevention and control unless the city offers water to all properties located within the city c method for measuring use of water supply system based on advice of its engineers the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the most precise method given available technology of measuring the use of the water supply from the system by any user is by a meter or meters installed and controlled by the city d continuation of service the city council has previously found and further currently reaffirms that in order to provide and continue to provide clean potable and other usable water to all customers of the system in quantities necessary for all varieties of use it is necessary from time to time to install improvements enlargements extensions and repairs to the system e purpose of charges the charges and fees for the use of and connection to the system are hereby established for the purpose of recovering the cost of construction reconstruction maintenance repair and operation of the system and to comply with federal and state safe drinking water acts and related regulations to provide for the payment principal of and interest on any bonds authorized to be issued as and when the same become due and payable to create a

obligations of the issuer such charges and fees shall be made in accordance with the purposes herein described as well as the following 1 all premises connected directly or indirectly to the system except as hereinafter provided shall be charged and shall make payments to the city in amounts computed on the basis of this section 2 the charges rates and fees for water service by the system are established herein to adequately provide for bond requirements and to ensure that the system does not operate at a deficit 3 the system staff or designated parties shall periodically review the charges rates fees rules and regulations of the system which review shall be completed not less than one time per fiscal year results of the review shall be reported to the city council with recommendations for any adjustments 4 the charges rates and fees shall be set so as to recover costs from users in reasonable proportion to the cost of serving those users f proportionality fairness and benefits of charges rates and fees 1 the city council has previously found and further currently reaffirms that the fairest and most reasonable method of providing for the operation maintenance repair replacement and improvement of the system is to charge each user based in all cases on amount of use for the costs of a retiring debt secured by the net revenues of the system issued to pay for improvements and replacements to the system  b ongoing repair replacement and improvement budgeted as part of the annual costs of the system  and c operation administration and maintenance costs of the system 2 the city has investigated several methods of apportioning the costs of the water service provided by the system based on its investigation and on the advice of its engineers the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that to ensure the stability and viability of the system for the benefit of its users the fairest and most accurate way to apportion the costs of operation maintenance replacement and improvement of the system is to charge each user a a separate capital connection charge for water service when such users property is first connected to the system  b a monthly service charge for water service which varies depending on the size of the water intake pipe and meter which charge reflects each users proportionate share of the fixed costs of the system  and c a commodity charge for water usage which is based on the users actual use of water supplied by the system the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the rates and charges currently in effect accurately apportion the fixed and variable costs of the system among the users of the system and that capital connection charge the monthly service charge and the commodity charge each provide actual benefits to such users in the form of ready access to water service that would be unavailable if such charges were not charged 3 in addition to the findings set forth in this section the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the capital connection charges reflect the proportional capital costs of the system previously paid by the city and the system attributable to each new user and that the opportunity to connect to the system provides actual benefits to each new user equal to or greater than the amount of such charges 08   establishment of water supply system based on the findings and for the purposes set forth in section 4654 the city has previously established and hereby reestablishes the water supply system

of the businesses industries governmental and charitable agencies and residents of the city and that the health safety and welfare of the businesses industries governmental and charitable agencies and residents is enhanced by the creation of a public sewer system and treatment plant with regulation by the city of pollutants and other harmful materials according to state and federal standards b method for measuring use  sewage disposal services based on advice of its engineers the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the most practical cost effective and accurate method given available technology of measuring the use of the systems sewers by any user is by the meter used to measure water usage c continuation of service the city council has previously found and further currently reaffirms that in order to provide and continue to provide for the safe and uninterrupted removal and treatment of sewage pollutants and other harmful materials it is necessary from time to time to install improvements enlargements extensions and repairs to the systems sewers and sewer service pipes d purpose of charges the charges and fees for the use of and connection to the

regulations of the system which review shall be completed not less than one time per fiscal year results of the review shall be reported to the city council with recommendations for any adjustments 4 the charges rates and fees shall be set so as to recover costs from users in reasonable proportion to the cost of serving those users e proportionality fairness and benefits of charges rates and fees 1 the city council has previously found and further currently reaffirms that the fairest and most reasonable method of providing for the operation maintenance repair replacement and improvement of the system is to charge each user based in all cases on amount of use for the costs of a retiring debt secured by the net revenues of the system issued to pay for improvements and replacements to the system  b ongoing repair replacement and improvement budgeted as part of the annual costs of the system  and c operation administration and maintenance costs of the system 2 the city has investigated several methods of apportioning the costs of the sewage disposal service provided by the system based on its investigation and on the advice of its engineers the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that to ensure the stability and viability of the system for the benefit of its users the fairest and most accurate way to apportion the costs of operation maintenance replacement and improvement of the system is to charge each user a a separate capital connection charge for sewage disposal service when such users property is first connected to the system  b a monthly service charge for sewage disposal service which varies depending on the size of the water intake pipe and meter which charge reflects each users proportionate share of the fixed costs of the system  and c a commodity charge for sewage disposal usage which is based on the users actual use of water supplied by the system the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the rates and charges currently in effect accurately apportion the fixed and variable costs of the system among the users of the system and that the capital connection charge the monthly service charge and the commodity charge each provide actual benefits to such users in the form of ready access to water service that would be unavailable if such charges were not charged 3 in addition to the findings set forth above the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the capital connection charges reflect the proportional capital costs of the system previously paid by the city and the system attributable to each new user and that the opportunity to connect to the system provides actual benefits to each new user equal to or greater than the amount of such charges 05   establishment

bioretention structure or a bioretention swale stormwater runoff entering the bioretention system is filtered first vegetation and then the sandsoil mixture before being conveyed downstream by the underdrain system runoff storage depths above the planting bed surface are typically shallow the adopted tss removal rate for bioretention systems is 90 percent bioretention systems are used to remove a wide range of pollutants such as suspended solids nutrients metals hydrocarbons and bacteria from stormwater runoff they can also be used to reduce peak runoff rates and increase stormwater infiltration when designed as a multistage multifunction facility    predesign site evaluation for infiltration trench and structure practices a minimum field infiltration rate fc of 052 inches per hour is required  lower rates preclude the use of these practices for surface sand filter and bioretention practices no minimum infiltration rate is required if these facilities are designed with a daylighting underdrain system  otherwise these facilities require a 052 inch per hour rate feasibility testing is to be conducted to screen unsuitable sites and reduce testing costs a soil boring is not required at this stage however a designer or landowner may opt to engage concept design borings at his discretion without feasibility testing initial testing involves either one field test per

and underdrain system shall be designed to fully drain the stormwater quality design storm runoff volume within 72 hours b permeability rates  the design permeability rate planting soil bed must be sufficient to fully drain the stormwater quality design storm runoff volume within 72 hours this permeability rate must be determined by field or laboratory testing since the actual permeability rate may vary from test results and may also decrease over time due to soil bed consolidation or the accumulation of sediments removed from the treated stormwater a factor of safety of two shall be applied to the tested permeability rate to determine the design permeability rate therefore if the tested permeability rate of the soil bed material is four incheshour the design rate would be two incheshour ie four inches per hour2 this design rate would then be used to compute the systems stormwater quality design storm drain time c planting soil bed the planting soil bed provides the environment for water and nutrients to be made available to the vegetation the soil particles can adsorb some additional pollutants exchange and voids within the soil particles can store a portion of the stormwater quality design storm runoff volume the planting soil bed material should consist of ten to 15 percent clays a minimum 65 percent sands with the balance as silts the materials ph should range from 55 to 65 the material shall be placed in 12 to 18 inch lifts the total depth or thickness of the planting soil bed should be a minimum of three feet as noted above the design permeability rate of the soil bed material must be sufficient to drain the stormwater quality design storm runoff volume within 72 hours filter fabric should be placed along the sides of the planting soil bed to prevent the migration of soil particles from the adjacent soil into the planting soil bed d vegetation  the vegetation in a bioretention system removes some of the nutrients and other pollutants in the stormwater inflow the use of native plant material is recommended for bioretention systems wherever possible the goal of the planting plan should be to simulate a forestshrub community of primarily upland type in general trees should dominate the perimeter zone that is subject to less frequent inundation shrubs and herbaceous species that are adapted to moister conditions and expected pollutant loads should be selected for the wetter zones the number of stems per acre should average 1000 with tree spacing of 12 feet and shrub spacing of eight feet e sand layer the sand layer serves as a transition between the planting soil bed and the gravel layer and underdrain pipes it shall be a minimum thickness of 12 inches and consist of clean medium aggregate sand aasshto m6astm c33 or mdot class ii to

blockage by debris or sediment and is readily accessible for inspection and maintenance blind connections to downstream storm sewers are prohibited g overflows  all bioretention systems must be able to safely convey system overflows to downstream drainage systems the capacity of the overflow must be consistent with the remainder of the sites drainage system and sufficient to provide safe stable discharge of stormwater in the event of an overflow h tailwater  the hydraulic design of the underdrain and overflow systems as well as any stormwater quantity control outlets must consider any significant tailwater effects of downstream waterways or facilities this includes instances where the lowest invert in the outlet or overflow structure is below the flood hazard area design flood elevation of a receiving stream i maintenance  the following requirements must be included in the systems maintenance plan 1 general maintenance all bioretention system components expected to receive andor trap debris and sediment must be inspected for clogging and excessive debris and sediment accumulation at least four times annually as well as after every storm exceeding one inch of rainfall such components may include bottoms trash racks low flow channels outlet structures riprap or gabion aprons and cleanouts sediment removal should take place when the structure is thoroughly dry disposal of debris trash sediment and other waste material should be done at suitable disposalrecycling sites and in compliance with all applicable local state and federal waste regulations 2 vegetated areas  mowing andor trimming of vegetation must be performed on a regular schedule based on city code enforcement standards vegetated areas must be inspected at least annually for erosion and scour vegetated areas should also be inspected at least annually for unwanted growth which should be removed with minimum disruption to the planting soil bed and remaining vegetation when establishing or restoring vegetation biweekly inspections of vegetation health should be performed during the first growing season or until the vegetation is established once established inspections of vegetation health density and diversity should be performed at least twice annually during both the growing and nongrowing seasons the vegetative cover should be maintained at 85 percent if vegetation has greater than 50 percent damage the area should be reestablished in accordance with the original specifications and the inspection requirements presented above all use of fertilizers mechanical treatments pesticides and other means to assure optimum vegetation health should not compromise the intended purpose of the bioretention system all vegetation deficiencies should be addressed without the use of fertilizers and pesticides whenever possible 3 structural components all structural components must be inspected for cracking subsidence spalling erosion and deterioration at least annually  infiltration an infiltration structure is a facility constructed within highly permeable soils that provides temporary storage of stormwater runoff an infiltration structure does not normally have a structural outlet to discharge runoff from the stormwater quality design storm instead outflow from an infiltration structure is surrounding soil an infiltration structure may also be combined with an extended detention structure to provide additional runoff storage for both stormwater quality and quantity management the adopted tss removal rate for infiltration structures is 80 percent infiltration structures are used to remove pollutants and to infiltrate stormwater back into the ground such infiltration also helps to reduce increases in both the peak rate and total volume of runoff caused by land development pollutant removal is achieved of the runoff soil as well as biological and chemical activity within the soil    predesign site evaluation infiltration structures can present some practical design problems when planning for an infiltration structure that provides stormwater quality treatment consideration should be given to soil characteristics depth to the groundwater table sensitivity of the region and runoff water quality specifically infiltration structures must not be used in the following locations  industrial and commercial areas where solvents andor petroleum products are loaded unloaded stored or applied or pesticides are loaded unloaded or stored  areas where hazardous materials are expected to be present in greater than reportable quantities as defined by the us environmental protection agency in the federal regulations at 40 cfr 3024  areas where infiltration structure use would be inconsistent with an njdepapproved remedial action work plan or landfill closure plan  areas with high risks for spills of toxic materials such as gas stations and vehicle maintenance facilities  areas where industrial stormwater runoff is exposed to source material source material means any materials or machinery located at an industrial facility that is directly or indirectly related to process manufacturing or other industrial activities that could be a source of pollutants in any industrial stormwater discharge to groundwater source materials include but are not limited to raw materials intermediate products final products waste materials byproducts industrial machinery and fuels and lubricants solvents and detergents that are related to process manufacturing or other industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater  areas where their installation would create a significant risk for basement seepage or flooding cause surficial flooding of groundwater or interfere with the operation of subsurface sewage disposal systems and other subsurface structures such adverse impacts must be assessed and avoided by the design engineer infiltration structures must be configured and located where their construction will not compact the soils below the structure in addition an infiltration structure must not be placed into operation until the contributing drainage area is completely stabilized minimal setback

ion stru ctur e typ e soils are perhaps the most important consideration for site suitability in general county soil surveys can be used to obtain necessary soil data for the planning and preliminary design of infiltration structures for final design and construction soil tests are required at the exact location of a proposed structure in order to confirm its ability to function without failure tests should include  determination of the textural classification   permeability of the subgrade soil at and below the bottom of the proposed infiltration structure the recommended minimum depth for subgrade soil analysis is five feet below the bottom of the structure or to the groundwater table soil permeability testing can be conducted in accordance with the standards for individual subsurface sewage disposal systems    design criteria a storage volume depth and duration an infiltration structure must be designed to treat the total runoff volume generated by the structures maximum design storm this may either be the groundwater recharge or stormwater quality design storm depending upon the structures proposed use an infiltration structure must also fully drain this runoff volume within 72 hours runoff storage for greater times can render the structure ineffective and may result in anaerobic conditions odor and both water quality and mosquito breeding problems the bottom of the infiltration structure must be at least two feet above seasonal high water table or bedrock for surface structures this distance must be measured from the bottom of the sand layer the structure bottom must be as level as possible to uniformly distribute runoff infiltration over the subgrade soils to enhance safety by minimizing standing water depths the vertical distance between the structure bottom and the maximum design storm water surface in surface infiltration structures should be no greater than two feet construction of an infiltration structure must be done without compacting the structures subgrade soils excavation must be performed by equipment placed outside the structure whenever possible this requirement should be considered when designing the dimensions and total storage volume of an infiltration structure it is important to note that the use of infiltration structures is recommended only for the stormwater quality design storm and smaller storm events use of infiltration structures for larger storm events and the requirements by which such structures are to be designed constructed and maintained should be reviewed and approved by all applicable reviewing agencies b permeability rates the minimum design permeability rate of the soils below an infiltration structure will depend upon the structures location and maximum design storm the use of infiltration structures for stormwater quality control is feasible only where soil is sufficiently permeable to allow a reasonable rate of infiltration therefore infiltration structures designed for storms greater than the groundwater recharge storm can be constructed only in areas with hydrologic soil group a and b soils ma xim um des ign str uct ure loc atio n min imu m des ign per

permeability rate of the soil must be sufficient to fully drain the infiltration structures maximum design storm runoff volume within 72 hours this design permeability rate must be determined by field testing see bioretention pre design since the actual permeability rate may vary from test results and may also decrease over time due to soil bed consolidation or the accumulation of sediments removed from the treated stormwater a factor of safety of two must be applied to the tested permeability rate to determine the design permeability rate therefore if the tested permeability rate of the soils is four incheshour the design rate would be two incheshour ie four inches per hour2 this design rate would then be used to compute the structures maximum design storm drain time c bottom sand layer to help ensure maintenance of the design permeability rate over time a sixinch layer of sand must be placed on the bottom of an infiltration structure this sand layer can intercept silt sediment and debris that could otherwise clog the top layer of the soil below the structure the sand layer will also facilitate silt sediment and debris removal from the structure and can be readily restored following removal operations the sand layer must meet the specifications of a mdot class ii sand this must be certified by a certified testing lab d overflows  all infiltration structures must be able to convey overflows to downstream drainage systems in a safe and stable manner the capacity of the overflow must be consistent with the remainder of the sites drainage system and sufficient to provide safe stable discharge of stormwater in the event of an overflow e subsurface infiltration structures a subsurface infiltration structure is located entirely below the ground surface it may consist of a vault perforated pipe andor stone bed however due to the greater difficulty in removing silt sediment and debris all runoff to a subsurface infiltration structure must be pretreated this pretreatment must remove 80 percent of the tss in the runoff from the structures maximum design storm f basis of design the design of an infiltration basin is based upon darcys law q   kia where q

excessive debris and sediment accumulation at least four times annually as well as after every storm exceeding one inch of rainfall such components may include bottoms riprap or gabion aprons and inflow points this applies to both surface and subsurface infiltration structures sediment removal should take place when the structure is thoroughly dry disposal of debris trash sediment and other waste material should be done at suitable disposalrecycling sites and in compliance with all applicable local state and federal waste regulations  detention storage facilities detention storage facilities are designed to detain runoff for a short period of time and then release it to a watercourse where it returns to the hydrologic cycle the objective of detention storage is to regulate the released runoff rate and to reduce the impact on downstream drainage systems detention storage should not be confused with retention storage ie retention basins a facility with no engineered outlet other than an emergencytype outlet designed to hold runoff for a considerable length of time the water in a retention basin is not discharged to surface water although it may infiltrate in to the ground evaporate or be consumed by plants in keeping with common law natural flow rights and the michigan drain concentrated discharges of stormwater such as the outflow from a detention facility or increased surface water runoff over property owned by others must be pursuant to a valid rightofway easement or other written permission from all property owners affected the outflow from a detention

the city engineer may require that the proprietors engineer generate and submit hydrographs of the outflow from the existing site and from the proposed site ie detention facility and a hydrograph of the flow in the receiving drain to verify that the detained outflow would not result in an increase in the peak flow in the receiving drain if the detained outflow would result in an increase in the peak flow in the receiving drain then stormwater detention is not an acceptable stormwater management option retention of stormwater or other stormwater management design approved by the city engineer must be provided see section 46222 retention basins for design requirements 5 portions of the developing site may be allowed to drain unrestricted ie not detention facility if either of the following conditions are met a the areas draining unrestricted are not being disturbed or altered by the construction such that they will maintain their existing drainage characteristics and patterns b the areas draining unrestricted are being disturbed or altered but will be permanently stabilized to prevent erosion and will not contain any impervious surface postconstruction in this case the unrestricted flow must be draining to a receiving drain with valid rightsof way or else written agreement from the affected property owners would have to be obtained per common law natural flow rights and the michigan drain addition the postconstruction peak 100year flow from these areas should be calculated and deducted from the total allowable peak flow from the detention facility qa the detention outlets should be designed to restrict the basin outflows to this reduced allowable peak flow rate 6 where the detention facility is to be equipped with a pump discharge the proprietor shall be required to furnish design data on pumps and discharge force main so that the capacity of the system can be verified these data will include system curve calculations the pump performance curves

which serve residential neighborhoods has deleterious effects on both business and residential segments of the neighborhood causing blight and a downgrading of property values a prohibition against the establishment of more than two regulated uses within 1000 feet of each other serves to avoid the clustering of certain businesses which when located in close proximity to each other tend to create a marginal atmosphere however such prohibition fails to avoid the deleterious effects of blight and devaluation of both business and residential property values resulting from the establishment of adult bookstores adult motion picture theaters adult minimotion picture theaters adult motion picture arcades adult motels adult massage parlors adult model studios adult sexual encounter centers and adult cabarets in a business district which is immediately adjacent to and which also serves adjoining residential neighborhoods concern for the pride in the orderly planning development and preservation of the integrity of a residential neighborhood should be encouraged and fostered by those businesses and those persons who might otherwise comprise the business and residential integrity

corridor overlay zone gratiot avenue corridor overlay zone a the intent of the gratiot avenue corridor overlay zone is to 1 improve traffic operations  2 reduce potential for crashes  3 improve pedestrian and transit environments  and 4 preserve the vehicular carrying capacity of gratiot avenue on the number spacing placement and design of access points published reports and recommendations by the michigan department of transportation mdot show a relationship between the number of access points and the number of crashes recognizing the existing built character and downtown land use characteristics in the city of eastpointe this chapter intends to apply the mdot access management standards where practical but to allow flexibility in their application given the unique needs of this more urbanized area development along gratiot avenue contains an interconnected grid street pattern and urban building form that is highly conducive to downtown activity this chapter intends to complement efforts to make gratiot avenue and downtown eastpointe more walkable by improving the transit and nonmotorized environments by limiting the amount of direct access to gratiot avenue and thus the number of potential vehicle to pedestrian crashes the segment of gratiot avenue within eastpointe is characterized by a median road design that naturally restricts turning movements to a single direction which present unique traffic operations  therefore this chapter places more emphasis on the design and spacing of driveways from signalized intersections and median crossovers b this overlay zone shall apply to all land with frontage along gratiot avenue the following applications must also comply with the standards of this section 1 new or enlarged building or structure any new principal building or structure or the enlargement of any principal building or structure by more than 25 percent 2 land division subdivision or site condominium any land division or subdivision or

consist of any individual driveway a shared access with an adjacent use or access via a service drive 3 additional access points additional access points may be permitted by the planning commission upon a finding that all other standards are met andor if a traffic impact study is submitted that justifies a need for additional access due to safety reasons or where a poor level of service will result from fewer access points 4 spacing and offset from intersections access points shall be either directly aligned or spacedoffset as far from intersections as practical especially signalized intersections a minimum spacing or offset of 150 feet is preferred 5 consideration of median crossovers access points along median sections of gratiot avenue shall be located in consideration of median crossovers the city supports mdot policies to limit the number of median crossovers to maintain traffic flow and reduce the potential for accidents access points shall directly align with or be offset a sufficient distance from median crossovers to allow for weaving across travel lanes and storage with the median a minimum offset of 250 feet is preferred d spacing of access points on same

engineer to verify the need for additional access points or to justify a modification c where it is determined by the certain site plan submittal requirements are not necessary to the review and understanding of the site the planning commission may waive the site plan requirements and allow submittal of a scaled drawing that provides sufficient detail to review site access j modification of plan standards 1 the planning commission may waive certain requirements of this section upon consideration of the following a the proposed modification is consistent with the general intent of the standards of this overlay zone and the recommendations of the gratiot avenue corridor improvement plan and published mdot guidelines b mdot staff endorses the proposed access design c driveway geometrics have been improved to the extent practical to reduce impacts on flow d the modification is for an access point that has or is expected to have very low traffic volumes less than 50 in and out bound trips per day and is not expected to significantly impact safe traffic operations e shared access has been provided or the applicant has demonstrated it is not reasonable f such modification

regulations which are flexible and allow for minor modifications in the strict enforcement of the zoning ordinance in reviewing the redevelopment of nonconforming nonresidential sites which are being redeveloped or have otherwise been removed destroyed or otherwise substantially modified  the planning commission may modify the following requirements of the ordinance in finding that the modifications are appropriate and acceptable since the overall modifications or redevelopment bring the site closer to conformance with the intent and regulations of the zoning ordinance 1 a structure location which does not meet the required setback provided the location represents an overall reduction in the nonconformity and that no easements or rightsofway are encumbered  2 driveways provided

residential use  telecommunication towers a purpose and intent it is the general purpose and intent of the city to carry out the will of the united states congress by authorizing communication facilities needed to operate wireless telecommunication systems however it is the further purpose and intent of the city to provide for such authorization in a manner which will retain the integrity of neighborhoods and the character property values and aesthetic quality of the community at large in fashioning and administering the provisions of this section attempt has been made to balance these potentially competing interests recognizing the number of providers authorized to establish and operate wireless telecommunication services and coverage it is the further purpose and intent of this section to 1 facilitate adequate and efficient provision of sites for wireless telecommunication facilities 2 establish predetermined districts or zones of the number and shape and in the location considered best for the establishment of wireless telecommunication facilities subject to applicable standards and conditions 3 recognize that the operation of a wireless telecommunication system may require the establishment of facilities in locations not within the predetermined districts or zones in such cases it has been determined that it is likely that there will be greater adverse impact upon neighborhoods and areas within the community consequently more stringent standards and conditions should apply to the review approval and use of such facilities 4 ensure that wireless telecommunication facilities are situated in appropriate locations and relationships to other land use structures and buildings 5 limit inappropriate physical and aesthetic overcrowding of land use activities and avoid adverse impact upon existing population transportation systems and other public services and facility needs 6 promote the public health safety and welfare 7 provide for adequate information about plans for wireless telecommunication facilities in order to permit the community to effectively plan for the location of such facilities 8 minimize the adverse impact of technological obsolescence of such facilities including a requirement to remove unused andor unnecessary facilities in a timely manner 9 minimize the negative visual impact of wireless telecommunication facilities on neighborhoods community landmarks historic sites and buildings natural beauty areas and public rightsof way this contemplates the establishment of as few structures as reasonably feasible and the use of structures which are designed for compatibility including the use of existing structures and the avoidance of lattice structures that are unnecessary taking into consideration the purposes and intent of this section 10 the city council finds that the presence of numerous support structures particularly if located within residential areas would decrease the attractiveness and destroy the character and integrity of the community this in turn would have an adverse impact upon property values therefore it is necessary to minimize the adverse impact from the presence of numerous relatively tall support structures having low architectural and other aesthetic appeal to most persons recognizing that the absence of regulation would result in a material impediment to the maintenance and promotion of property values and further recognizing that this economic component is an important part of the public health safety and welfare b permitted uses in the following circumstances a proposal to establish a new wireless telecommunication facility shall be deemed a permitted use 1 an existing structure which will serve as an attached wireless

attached wireless telecommunication facilities and wireless telecommunication support structures in the interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this section as stated above and as stated in this section if a provider fails or refuses to permit colocation on a facility owned or otherwise controlled by such provider where colocation is feasible the result will be that a new and unnecessary
