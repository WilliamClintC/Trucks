division 2  stormwater management intent and purpose the purpose of this division is to diminish threats to public health safety and welfare caused by runoff of excessive stormwater from new development and redevelopment this excessive stormwater could result in the inundation of damageable properties the erosion and destabilization of downstream channels and the pollution of valuable stream and river resources the cause of increases in stormwater runoff quantity and rate and impairment of quality is the development and improvement of land and as such this division regulates these activities to prevent adverse impacts this division is adopted to accomplish the following objectives 1 to ensure that new development does not increase the drainage or flood hazards to others or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion  2 to protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage due to increased stormwater runoff  3 to protect human life and

purpose of this division is to safeguard persons protect property prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on land situation in the city this division is adopted with the following understandings 1 excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses including but not limited to the construction of dwelling units commercial buildings and industrial plants the building of roads and highways and the creation of recreational facilities  2 the washing blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles  3 soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies washedout fills and embankments  4 sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers streams lakes and reservoirs  5 sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds destroys fish and other desirable aquatic life and is costly and difficult to remove  and 6 sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways resulting in increased chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety    general principles it is the objective of this division to control soil erosion and sedimentation caused by development activities in the city measures taken to control erosion and sedimentation should be adequate to ensure that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of tenyear frequency or less the following principles shall apply to all development activities within the city and to the preparation of the submissions required 1 development should be related to the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible 2 natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses should be left undisturbed wherever possible 3 the smallest practical areas of land should be exposed for the shortest practical time during development 4 sediment basins debris basins desilting basins or silt traps or filters should be installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing development 5 the selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion and on evaluation of the risks costs and benefits involved 6 in the design of erosion control facilities and practices aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered 7 provision should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities of discharges will not create additional erosion 8 permanent vegetation and structures should be installed as soon as practical during development    site development permit a permit required except as otherwise provided in this division no person shall commence or perform

treated differently in the housing market because of racial religious or other prejudices the entire community suffers discrimination frequently denies its immediate victims their right to acquire a decent home in a safe and pleasant neighborhood discrimination also typically causes neighborhoods to become highly segregated and engenders instability on the fringes of such areas this instability seriously impairs any sense of community responsibility and accelerates neighborhood decay neighborhood decay reduces the housing supply and deflates the tax base concurrently it increases the need for government services and necessitates a higher tax rate b although discrimination in housing is proscribed by the united states and illinois constitutions and by various federal laws the problem is best handled at the local level because there is no statewide enforcement program and the federal enforcement machinery is disturbingly slow inadequate and sometimes simply unresponsive to local needs

case of commercial or industrial facilities auxiliary buildings will not be assigned separate numbers but the main building where business is transacted will receive a property number 12 numbering on

correspond with the numbering on the street where the circle is originated there will be more properties on the outside of the circle than on the inside of the circle in such cases numbers shall be assigned in the regular manner to the side of the circle thoroughfare having the greatest property frontage along the thoroughfare using consecutive odd or even numbers numbers shall then be assigned to the side having the shorter frontage such that numbers correspond with property on the opposite side of the thoroughfare it is wise to avoid duplication of numbers if an auxiliary thoroughfare

which districts the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform it is recognized however that there are uses which because of their unique characteristics cannot be properly classified in any particular district without consideration of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location such special uses fall into two categories 1 uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest 2 uses entirely private in character but of such unusual nature that operation of the use may give rise to unique problems with respect to the impact upon neighboring property or public facilities no lot or land located within the city shall be utilized for any use which would be characterized as a special use under the above and foregoing definition unless a permit therefor shall have been issued by the city council in accordance with the provisions of this section b any person firm or corporation owning or having an interest in a lot or parcel of land may file an application for a special use permit for such lot or land and such

been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets e in addition to requirements of subsection d of this section the plan

and for that purpose relief by mandatory injunction may be sought in addition if any holder of a special use permit shall fail to abide by any of the conditions made applicable to such use then the special use permit may be revoked by action of the zoning board of appeals upon hearing and notice given by the building official i if a special use shall not have been established within one year
