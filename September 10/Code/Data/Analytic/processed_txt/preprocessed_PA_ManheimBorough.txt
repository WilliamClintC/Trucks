stormwater management   1872 statement of findings the manheim borough council finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities  contributes to erosion and sedimentation  overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers  greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater  undermines floodplain management and floodreduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities  reduces groundwater recharge  and threatens public health and safety b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the borough and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality d federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues f nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems ms4 can contribute to pollution of waters of this commonwealth g inadequate maintenance of stormwater best management practices bmps causes loss of water quality flooding and other problems h a program of reasonable regulation of connections and discharges to municipal stormwater management facilities will be beneficial  1871 general provisions  1873   1873 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote health safety and welfare within manheim borough by minimizing the damages described in  1872 of this chapter designed to a meet legal water quality requirements under state law including

source by regulating activities that cause these problems c utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems d maintain recharge of groundwater to prevent degradation of surface water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources e maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the borough and the commonwealth f preserve and restore the floodcarrying capacity of streams g provide proper operations and maintenance of all temporary and permanent stormwater management facilities and best management practices bmps that are constructed

front setback lines etc add to the character and uniqueness of the borough in an effort to maintain the character of a historic resource neighborhood district or the community it may be appropriate for the zoning hearing board to grant variances to certain design criteria ie lot coverage minimum setback or other area and bulk requirements similarly these issues need to be considered when development of a vacant lot is proposed within an established neighborhood andor adjacent to a historic resources efforts to protect historic resources located on large parcels proposed for

deemed to be sufficiently sized even though a nonconforming side yard setback exists if the subdivision plan compensates for the deficiency by providing an enlarged setback area on the opposite side andor rear yard of the proposed parcel this modification may result in the creation of a lot which does not comply with stated minimum lot area or maximum coverage provision  the major factor in granting a variance to design standards shall be the impact that the proposal will have on the character of the neighborhood district or community as well as any direct impact that the proposal will have on adjacent class i or class ii historic resources b the residual lot area left for development may only be divided in a fashion which replicates the character of the neighborhood  variances granted to design standards ie lot width building setback yard area maximum lot coverage minimum lot area etc shall not be less than the average of those found within the neighborhood and shall

space area as may be reasonably required  the lot may be deemed to be of sufficient size even though minimum building setbacks are presently lacking on one or more sides of the resource if
