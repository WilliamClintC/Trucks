high quality development in the city by providing additional flexibility in the planning and development of projects such flexibility is intended to result in development that is more efficient environmentally sensitive visually pleasing safe and socially integrated than traditional zoning might provide the pud overlay district is also meant to provide the city with the ability to better manage development in areas that are adjacent to residential development the specific purposes of the pud overlay district are to  establish a procedure for the development of land under unified controls to increase flexibility from the strict application of land use regulations development standards and procedures intended primarily for individual lots   ensure orderly and thorough review procedures that will result in quality design protection of open space and sensitive areas and the creation and improvement of common open space and pedestrian and bicycle circulation particularly in residential areas   achieve efficient land use patterns while permitting creative and innovative approaches to the development of urban and suburban residential commercial and industrial land   encourage mixed development patterns architectural styles and building forms to avoid monotony in large developments by allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access light open space amenities  and  provide for flexibility in the strict application of certain of the land use regulations and performance standards found in the base zoning districts to take advantage of special site characteristics location andor land uses  consider the impact on adjacent developed properties particularly residential areas and enter into a documented dialog to address their issues and concerns  all pud overlay districts shall have an underlying zoning designation b zoning map designator a pud overlay district will be combined with the base zoning districts applied to the area and will be shown on the zoning map by a pud designator applied to the base districts designation c applicability the applicability of the pud overlay district shall be as follows 1 allowable locations no pud overlay district may be applied to an area of the city that is not served by critical infrastructure such as potable water sanitary sewer storm sewer and paved streets except where one or more of such services not currently in place is included in the citys master plan for installation or construction within a threeyear period from the date of the application for a planned unit development in addition no pud overlay district may be applied to an area that is located more than onemile from a major arterial street as designated by the city planner or designee or shown on the master transportation plan 2 minimum area no pud overlay district may be applied to a land area less than fiveacres for residential development and twoacres for nonresidential development d land use regulations any use authorized in article iii division 2 base district regulations may be included in a pud overlay district provided such use is consistent with the land use concepts in the comprehensive plan for the area to be included in the pud overlay district and is not disruptive or inconsistent with current neighboring development particularly residential areas existing uses are permitted and may continue all uses in the pud overlay district shall be in accordance with the master plan approved for the district refer to subsection h e development regulations the total number of dwelling units in a pud overlay district shall not exceed that permitted by the comprehensive plan density for the total area of parcels designated for residential use other development regulations such as for building scale building form and location pedestrian orientation parking accommodation open space and landscaping and other standards shall be as prescribed by the development plan approved for the district and may depart from conformance with the standards specified in the base zoning district where the pud overlay district is applied if specifically approved by the planning and zoning commission andor city council f initiation a pud overlay district may be initiated by a property owner or authorized agent the planning and zoning commission or the city council if the property is not under a single ownership then all owners shall join in the application and a map showing the extent of ownerships shall be submitted with concept plans and materials g criteria for consideration of pud overlay district application the planning and zoning commission shall consider an application for rezoning to a pud overlay district as prescribed under section 12549 and shall at the same time consider a proposed concept plan for the area a recommendation of the planning and zoning commission to rezone to a pud overlay district shall be accompanied by a resolution recommending approval of the concept plan in addition to the criteria for considering an application for a zoning map amendment under section 12549 the planning and zoning commission shall recommend approval or conditional approval of the concept plan to the city council upon finding that 1 the concept plan is consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan and other applicable policies and is compatible with surrounding development  2 the concept plan will enhance the potential for superior urban design and amenities in comparison with the development under the base district regulations that would apply if the concept plan were not approved  3 deviations from the base district regulations that otherwise would apply are justified by compensating benefits of the concept plan  and 4 the concept plan includes adequate provisions for utilities services and emergency vehicle access  and public service demands will not exceed the capacity of existing and planned systems see the adequate public facilities ordinance for these requirements refer to subsection i for the requirements of a concept plan h procedures for pud overlay district application in addition to the procedures for an application for a zoning map amendment under section 12549 an application for rezoning to a pud overlay district shall be processed in the following manner 1 preapplication conference prior to submitting an application for a planned unit development the prospective applicant shall request a review by the city planner or designee and representatives from other city departments as appropriate to discuss the prospective development with respect to compatibility with existing and anticipated land uses in the vicinity and the citys adopted planning rationale the preapplication conference is intended to guide the prospective applicant in the preparation of a concept plan to be submitted for planning and zoning commission consideration and city council approval there is no fee associated with a request for a preapplication conference  however additional requests for a preapplication conference for the same site within a period of oneyear from the date of the initial conference may incur a fee associated with any city costs to do so 2 submission and approval of concept plan the applicant shall submit a concept plan bubble plan as part of the application for rezoning to a pud overlay district the required contents of which are noted in subsection i below the city planner or designee shall prepare a written report on the concept plan that will summarize the anticipated impacts of the proposed development on planning goals utilities emergency services vehicular traffic taxes and properties within a 500foot distance of the site for which the development is proposed the concept plan a list of requested variances and report by the city planner or designee shall be submitted for consideration by the planning and zoning commission and recommendation to city council upon approval by city council of the concept plan the applicant may proceed with the preparation of a master plan and proceed to subsequent steps for approval with reasonable assurance that if the agreed upon concept is carried forth then preliminary and final plat approvals will be granted by the city following approval of the concept plan by city council the applicant shall prepare a master plan the required contents of which are noted in subsection i below recommendation for approval or denial of a pud overlay district shall be made by the planning and zoning commission and approved or denied by city council 3 approval of master plan after city council has approved the pud overlay district then the applicant shall submit a master plan for consideration and approval by the planning and zoning commission the applicant may proceed with platting after approval of the master plan the master plan must not have more than a 15 percent change in the land use or a significant change in geographic location from the previously approved concept plan for the pud overlay district changes that alter the uses permitted by more than 15 percent andor have a significant change in geographic location shall require submittal of a revised concept plan to be considered and approved by the commission and city council via a public hearing and notified in the same manner as a text or map amendment when determining whether or not a pud development has exceeded 15 percent and should be considered by city council each of the following shall be considered a the total acreage change in the pud development based on the original concept plan document the concept plan establishes the land use acreages and represents the baseline in determining the percentage of change example in a 100acre pud an increase of ten acres of residential and a decrease of ten acres of commercial is still a total change of ten acres and the percentage of change of the total acreage is ten percent b percentage of change increased or decreased within each land use category based on the original concept plan document for residential uses the density units per acre shall also be calculated example in a 100acre pud a decrease from 15 to ten acres in the residential land use category represents a five percent change in acreage however an increase in density units per acre dua from 100 dua to 150 dua represents a 50 percent density increase c intangibles such as relocating a thoroughfare shown on the transportation plan changing the general concept or changing the location of uses that may not necessarily have anything to do with the acreage of land uses per se but may be just as important in evaluating whether or not a pud should be reconsidered by the commission and city council 4 lapse of approval and renewal of master plan a master plan shall be effective on the date the ordinance creating the pud overlay district is approved and shall expire after two years unless a building permit has been issued and a vested right established an approved master plan may specify a development staging program exceeding two years the planning and zoning commission may recommend and the

planner or designee not less than 30 days or more than 120 days prior to expiration 5 revisions to master plan changes to the master plan that do not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property  do not alter the uses permitted or increase the density building height or coverage of the site  do not decrease the offstreet parking ratio or reduce the yards provided at the boundary of the site  and do not significantly alter the landscape plans or signage as indicated on the approved development may be recommended by the city planner or designee and approved by the planning and zoning commission the master plan must not have more than a 15 percent change in the land use or a significant change in geographic location from the previously approved concept plan for the pud overlay district changes that alter the uses permitted by more than 15 percent andor have a significant change in geographic location shall require submittal of a revised

representatives from other city departments as appropriate to discuss the prospective development with respect to compatibility with existing and anticipated land uses in the vicinity and the citys adopted planning rationale the preapplication conference is intended to guide the prospective applicant in the preparation of a concept plan to be submitted for planning and zoning commission consideration and city council approval there is no fee associated with a request for a preapplication conference  however additional requests for a preapplication conference for the same site within a period of oneyear from the date of the initial conference may incur a fee associated with any city costs to do so 2 submission and approval of concept plan the applicant shall submit a concept plan

on the concept plan that will summarize the anticipated impacts of the proposed development on planning goals utilities emergency services vehicular traffic taxes and properties within a 200foot distance of the site for which the development is proposed the concept plan and report by the city planner or designee shall be submitted for consideration by the planning and zoning commission and recommendation to city council upon approval of the concept plan by city council the applicant may proceed with the preparation of a master plan the required contents of which are noted in bsection r below and proceed to subsequent steps for approval with reasonable assurance that if the agreed upon concept is carried forth then preliminary and final plat approvals will be granted by the city 3 approval of master plan after city council has approved the tnd overlay district then the applicant shall submit a master plan for consideration and approval by the planning and zoning commission the applicant may proceed with platting after approval of the master plan the master plan must not have more than a 15 percent change in the land use or a significant change in geographic location from

submittal of a revised concept plan to be considered and approved by the commission and city council via a public hearing and notified in the same manner as a text or map amendment when determining whether or not a tnd development has exceeded 15 percent and should be considered by the commission and city council each of the following shall be considered a the total acreage change in the tnd development based on the original concept plan document the concept plan establishes the land use acreages and represents the baseline in determining the percentage of change example in a 100acre tnd an increase of ten acres of residential and a decrease of ten acres of commercial is still a total change of ten acres and the percentage of change of the total acreage is ten percent b percentage of change increased or decreased within each land use category based on the original concept plan document for residential uses the density units per acre shall also be calculated example in a 100acre tnd a decrease from 15 to ten acres in the residential land use category represents a five percent change in acreage however an increase in density units per acre dua from 100 dua to 150 dua represents a 50 percent density increase c intangibles such as relocating a thoroughfare shown on the transportation plan changing the general concept or changing the location of uses that may not

areas of the city as prescribed in the comprehensive plan that provide opportunities for shopping employment and entertainment for residents of both the city and region   ensure that major activity centers are convenient and beneficial to city residents and are designed to accommodate both auto and pedestrianorientation in their location access layout scale and design   provide for a range of commercial public and semipublic and residential uses and activities that encourage interest vitality and social interaction in the area and create a sense of place  and  provide for circulation systems and streetscapes that are safe efficient and pleasant for pedestrians bicyclists transit riders and automobile drivers three subdistricts are established under the mac overlay district the additional purposes of each subdistrict are  mixed format retail mfr this subdistrict provides opportunities for an active mix of retailoriented uses in a main street format that balances vehicular and pedestrian access development in the subdistrict will result in a pedestrianfriendly environment in terms of building orientation and scale pedestrian circulation and outdoor amenity a range of building sizes are encouraged in this subdistrict with floorplates generally ranging between 1500 and 25000 square feet so as to accommodate a variety of retail uses such as delicoffee gifts booksnews musicvideo restaurant clothinglinens housewaresfurniture electronics and hardware offices and related business services may also be accommodated on upper floors and will generally take the form of smallscale professional practices such as medical and legal offices although largerscale office developments are possible provided they contain pedestrianoriented retail uses on the ground floor residential uses on upper floors may also be permitted buildings in this subdistrict must establish a welldefined street wall consistent placement of retail storefronts and will be at least two
