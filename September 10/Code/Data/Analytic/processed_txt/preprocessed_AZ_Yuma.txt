1sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this chapter as adult theaters and adult cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids acquired immunodeficiency syndrome caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states 600 in 1982  2200 in 1983  4600 in 1984  8555 in 198 and 253448  the center for disease control indicates that of the 753907 aids cases reported in the united states of 200 arizona accounted for 7234 of those cases at the end of 199 there were 3195 people reported to be living with aids in arizona 8as of december 200 there have been 7966 reported cases of aids in the state of arizona 9since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the hiv antibody test in yuma county arizona 10the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 198 and 45200  11the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 12in his report of  the surgeon general of the united states has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 16the findings noted in subsections 1 15 raise substantial governmental concerns 17sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of the sexually oriented businesses  further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres 20requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 21the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct 23the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 24the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 25the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter 80  passed 22091  passed 21903  7502 definitions for the purpose of this chapter the following

9299penalty general provisions  9201 purpose and findings athe purpose of this chapter is to establish a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory policy governing the management of public rightsofway for the provision of telecommunications services to that end the city council seeks to enable the city to 1authorize nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral access to and use of the public rightsofway by providers of telecommunications services while ensuring that those who have placed facilities in the rightofway or otherwise use such facilities to provide telecommunications services fairly compensate the city for that access and use  and 2manage the public rightsofway in order to minimize the impact and cost to yuma citizens of the placement of telecommunications facilities within city rightsofway  and 3manage the public rightsofway so as to maximize their efficient use thereby minimizing the foreclosure of future additional uses of such rightsofway  and 4promote competition among telecommunications service providers and encourage the universal availability of advanced telecommunications services to all residents and businesses of the city  and 5minimize congestion inconvenience visual impact and other adverse effects on the citys public rightsofway bthe city council finds that the citys rightsofway constitute a valuable public asset 1having been acquired and maintained by the city over many years at great taxpayer expense  2providing uniquely valuable property that private telecommunications providers may wish to use for profitmaking purposes that may not necessarily benefit all the residents of the city  3representing public investments for which the taxpayers are entitled to a fair monetary return on the citys past and future investment in the citys infrastructure  and 4comprising significant assets which the city must manage as a public fiduciary trust to enhance the public health safety and welfare ctherefore in this chapter the city council intends 1to ensure that locally elected officials manage local rightsofway consistent with their fiduciary trust obligations  2to ensure compliance with public health safety and welfare measures for city rightsofway  3to encourage publicprivate partnerships to provide telecommunications facilities needed for the most costeffective delivery of public services including schools libraries police and fire protection as well as private services  4to conserve the limited physical capacity of the rightsofway held in public trust by the city  5to assure that the citys current and ongoing costs of granting and regulating private access to and use of the rightsofway are fully paid by the persons seeking such access and causing such costs  and 6to secure fair and reasonable compensation to the city and the residents of the city for use of the rightsofway for private installation of telecommunications facilities in the exercise of its police and other powers

section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners bit is the duty of the yuma city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure that is built below the rfe are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate passed 81606  15126 appeal board athe fpb of the yuma city council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter bthe fpb shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision

specified in other sections of this chapter and 1the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion

electrical water system and streets and bridges dupon consideration of the factors of  15126c and the purposes of this chapter the fpb may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter eany applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and 2such

increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases bvariances may be issued for the repair rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure cvariances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result dvariances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief evariances shall only be issued upon a 1showing of good and sufficient cause  2determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant

adoption of pattern books or formbased codes as regulatory documents this approach is intended to allow a broad range of uses and options in order to encourage the development of diverse attractive neighborhoods 3the development plan review process will assure that adjacent uses are compatible and that design is of a high quality the zoning administrator or his or her designee shall review all sgo district project plans to ensure proposed development patterns and standards as depicted in the pattern book or formbased code comply with the purpose and intent of the district 4the purpose will be accomplished by the adoption of sitespecific pattern books or formbased codes which evaluate urban design projects from the regional to the architectural scale pattern books or formbased codes include a plan displaying the pattern of development for allowed uses lot types and development standards and available architectural styles and design standards pattern books or formbased codes will support the sgo district by the following actions apromoting mixed land uses and mixeduse commercialresidential buildings  btaking advantage of compact design  cfostering distinctive and attractive communities by including parks pedestrian oriented streets public art and community facilities  dsupporting a variety of transportation choices to enhance the interconnectivity between mixeduse commercial and residential neighborhoods via streets with detached sidewalks bike paths and walking paths  eincreasing the availability of housing by creating a range of housing opportunities in neighborhoods  festablishing flexible development standards  gensuring high quality architecture and urban design that reflects classic elements including vernacular or local styles  and hclearly defining and activating the public realm by locating buildings to form street edges and corners and locating buildings to activate the street level 5to accomplish the purpose it will be necessary to form a special taxing district such as a community facilities district for maintenance of landscaping and nonnecessary public infrastructure for example pedestrian oriented streets public art water features bike and walking paths the developer will enter into a development agreement requiring the developer to post assurances until such time that the taxing district generates sufficient revenues

outlines principles for building better communities from the scale of the region down to the block the principles are intended to guide public policy development practice urban planning and design it is the intent of the sgo district that development shall recognize and be in harmony with the principles of new urbanism as summarized below acivic sites clearly identified and at a prominent location civic sites should attract residents to that location where they can meet neighbors or have scheduled community events they also lead to a sense of place which increases pride in ones community bwalkability a modified grid design with sidewalks mixed with linear parks and parkways encourages residents to move around without the use of automobiles this is particularly important for children and the elderly as well as reducing fuel consumption on unnecessary vehicle trips cconnectivity plentiful connections between different communities within a development reduces traffic on connector routes by allowing for traffic to flow on a greater number of local streets dmix of land uses uses in addition to residential within a properly designed development can provide a sense of place access to mixeduse centers should be encouraged by both vehicles and nonvehicular means connections sidewalks and the like mixeduse centers may provide housing and nonhousing within the same district or may provide only nonresidential uses if well connected to adjacent residential uses retail within mixed use must have good visibility from high volume thoroughfares as well as plentiful parking in order to be financially successful good design can accommodate both these needs into a mixeduse design ediverse housing types singlefamily townhouses multifamily apartments and condos can be integrated into one development as long as the scale and design of adjacent uses is compatible with each other a mix of housing types ensures that people of various socioeconomic classes may live in proximity to one another and share a common pride in the community fhigh quality architecture and urban design architecture should reflect classic elements including vernacular or local styles however overly prescriptive architectural standards may raise the cost of housing construction and should be flexible when considering workforce housing gincreased density more units on smaller lots allows for preservation of open space reduces infrastructure and maintenance costs and allows for a more diverse mix of housing stock which opens communities up to many socioeconomic groups henvironmental sensitivity open space areas should also be counted toward not in addition to other open space requirements such as setbacks and park dedication this mainly applies to suburban locations that have existing natural features on site but there are opportunities even in more urban settings ipublic transportation the structure of these communities good connectivity walkability and higher density

from an infected mother to her newborn  13according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts  14sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities  15numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films  16the findings noted in divisions b1 b15 above raise substantial governmental concerns  17sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns  18a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein  19removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres  20requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments  21the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases  22in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this section is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct  23the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this section  24the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases  and 25the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this section clocation requirements 1adult oriented businesses may be located in limited commercial b1

portion of the property provide protected development rights adoption of a specific plan which works in conjunction with a development agreement and the platting process bproject description 1cielo verde is a 382acre mixeduse master planned development providing a variety of commercial uses and housing types in a pedestrianoriented neighborhoodfocused community planned primarily for adult living 2the project takes advantage of the existing topography of the site by providing a linear park which follows existing drainage contours of the site the land plan minimizes major earth moving for stormwater control and provides a significant community amenity which doubles as a recreation area for its residents and guests 3designated areas are planned to contain open space ramadas security lighting landscaping and linear walking paths throughout the project other active recreation activities and structures putting greens tennis courts a recreation center for example may be added alternate uses are contemplated in most areas to provide flexibility in order to respond to evolving market demands in the future 4there are two distinct commercial areas residentsupported commercial sites line the central entry road leading into the residential portion of the project and more communityregional commercial areas along 32nd street provide for accommodation of larger retail and service establishments 5a maximum of 1932 residential lots can be developed on approximately 317 acres of the property designated for residential uses there are a range of residential lot sizes and dwelling unit types provided minimum residential lot sizes range from 1800 square feet for the rv park lots to 6000 square feet for the manufactured homesite built lots multifamily units are limited to lower density townhomes and apartment clusters within individual neighborhoods lot sizes can be considerably larger than the minimum permitted area 6the development of the master community shall be achieved in stages as market demands arise parcels may be developed or further subdivided to meet these demands the developers credit assurances required for the public facility improvements outlined in the development agreement shall not be posted until each parcel is replatted for the final development or a building permit is issued for any given parcel the improvements shall include the improvements adjacent to the parcel being developed in accordance with the provisions of this specific plan the development agreement and the individual plats as well as any improvements that need to be in place in order to provide road fire and utility access to the parcel cpolicies 1project policies ato create a development which offers a variety of housing types with support commercial facilities and a centrally located park recreation area within convenient walking or biking access from all areas of the community  bto provide the necessary infrastructure and services for residential and commercial uses  cto create an aesthetically cohesive community by providing a common desert landscape theme  dto create distinct neighborhoods throughout the plan linked by pedestrian and nonautomotive personal vehicular pathways  and eto create community identity readily associated with the cielo verde specific plan community 2design policies ato create a sense of community and neighborhood identity  bto use open space landscaping and urban design to strengthen identity and image  cto use fences walls landscaping and berms on the perimeter of neighborhoods to provide privacy screening define property limits separate use areas and provide security  dto promote building height and bulk appropriate to the size shape and topography of the site and in harmony with its setting  eto utilize a variety of site sizes to encourage efficiency in design and to facilitate a mixture of housing product types and densities  fto provide designated automotive parking areas which facilitate both vehicular and pedestrian movements  gto utilize landscaping and screening making parking areas visually attractive and compatible with their surroundings  hto use appropriate signage for the purpose of identification and direction the design of permitted signs should be consistent with and architecturally integrated into building and streetscape design themes  ito place outdoor lighting in such a way that it accents architectural features and outdoor spaces while minimizing glare or excessive light spillage on neighboring sites  and jto maintain the design objective of creating human scale spaces and buildings that do not appear monumental or monotonous in the context of the community dconcepts 1neighborhood concept acielo verde is a masterplanned development designed to create a sense of traditional community while streets are amply designed to accommodate circulation of the largest recreation vehicles and delivery of manufactured housing units as well as fire and municipal service vehicles the emphasis is on pedestrian and other nonautomotive transportation modes ba secondary network of walking and biking paths is incorporated into some street sections and also follows a branching central linear park to connect smallerscale residential neighborhoods with recreation and social activity facilities and local shopping and commercial services 1commercial development athe commercial site has business frontage on 32nd street and interstate 8 i8 at the citys eastern gateway interchange in addition to providing a regional center for highwayoriented retail activity the commercial development will create a buffer between the highway and adjoining residential neighborhoods while providing an important amenity for local residents bthe central entry road leading into the residential site passes neighborhoodscale shopping area which is intended to be a place for local retail shops and services located within walking and bicycling distance of all of the housing neighborhoods the neighborhood shopping area at the entrance to cielo verde will present a variety of shops and services for local residents and once fully developed will help to reduce the amount of vehicular traffic entering and exiting onto 32nd street as many of the residents needs will be met onsite 2residential development atargeted to the seasonal visitor and retiree markets cielo verde presents an opportunity for transitional lifestyles the alternative of rental occupancy is presented in each housing type in order to provide choice and to permit new residents to try out the community before making a longterm commitment the presence of site built housing within cielo verde will also give a greater range of choice for secondhome buyers and will provide a supply of lots to local builders who may wish to participate in development of the community ba variety of residential housing forms will be created clustered in discreet neighborhoods of approximately 50 to 100 homes the coexistence of site built and manufactured homes along with rv units and socalled park models has already been demonstrated to work effectively from a market viewpoint in the foothills community in east yuma in addition multifamily units including lowdensity townhomes as well as clustered rental apartment units may be offered in the project if warranted by market conditions ccielo verde will complement existing housing supply by offering a range of lot sizes many larger than the minimum required for each housing type with a variety of premium features 2streetscapecirculation concept awhile the major collector roads within the development are consistent with local standard and with precedent well established in the city street sections within and between the individual residential neighborhoods are generally narrower than commonly found in other comparable local developments resulting reduced traffic speed and emphasis on pedestrian circulation will contribute to safety and help to create the character of a traditional town bpedestrian and nonautomotive unique vehicle uses are provided by attractive and fun to use sidewalks and pathways within some road sections elsewhere a system of offstreet pathways follows the contour of the linear park system branching into each neighborhood cample street widths and turning radii are provided in all cases for fire and municipal service vehicles as well as for mobile vacation vehicles and manufactured home deliveries 3open spacerecreation concept as presently envisioned in the master plan community facilities may include a recreation center with indooroutdoor pool wading pools rooms for crafts and social functions dance floor auditorium and stage with

calculates development fees at the time of application for a construction permit and the applicant must pay the fees due at the time of and prior to the issuance of a construction permit bcalculation 1upon receipt of an application for a construction permit the city determines awhether the proposed use is a residential or nonresidential use  bthe specific category of residential or nonresidential development if applicable  cthe number of new service units if for a residential use in dwelling units and if for a nonresidential use in new or additional square feet of gross floor area  and dthe service area in which the new development is located 2upon receipt of an application for a construction permit the city determines whether the development proposed involves a change in use in such cases the development fee due is based on only the incremental increase in the fee for the additional public facilities needed for the change in use 3after making these determinations the city calculates the demand for the public facility created by the proposed new development for each public facility category for which a development fee is being imposed and calculates the applicable development fee by multiplying the service units proposed by the amount of the applicable development fee per service unit incorporating any applicable credit 4if the type of land use proposed for new development is not expressly listed in the particular development fee ordinance the coordinator aidentifies the most similar land use type listed and calculates the development fee based on the development fee for the land use identified  bidentifies the broader land use category within which the proposed land use would apply and calculates the development fee based on the development fee for that land use category  or cdetermines the basis used to calculate the fee pursuant to an independent impact analysis as provided for below in the event that the coordinator is required to determine the proper classification of a proposed new development pursuant to subsections a or b above the coordinators determination must be based on a generallyaccepted land use classification system eg the north american industry classification system the landbased classification standards apa andor ites trip generation manual and consistent with the land use assumptions infrastructure improvements plan and fee study 5in the event an applicant believes that the impact to public facilities necessitated by new development is less than the development fee imposed in  15706 the applicant may prior to issuance of a construction permit request that the city have prepared an independent impact analysis based on the proposed development to arrive at an alternative development fee calculation aall costs incurred by the city in the preparation of an independent impact analysis shall be borne by the applicant and no construction permit shall be issued until the independent impact analysis is complete and a determination as to the appropriate fee is made by the coordinator bupon the request of an applicant the coordinator shall have prepared an independent impact analysis consistent with the requirements of this section cthe independent impact analysis must be calculated for that land use type analyzed for the applicable service area and based on data information or assumptions contained in this chapter the land use assumptions infrastructure improvements plan and fee study or an independent source provided that 1the independent source is a generallyaccepted standard source of demographic and planning data  or 2the independent source is a local study supported by a database adequate for the conclusion contained in the independent impact analysis and performed pursuant to a generallyaccepted methodology dif a previous applicant has submitted a local study consistent with the criteria for an independent impact analysis and if such study is determined by the coordinator to be current the impact upon the public facilities as described in such prior local study shall be presumed to exist for a similar land use proposed by a subsequent applicant there shall be a rebuttable presumption that an independent impact analysis conducted more than three years earlier is invalid eif the coordinator determines that the independent impact analysis complies with the requirements of this section and the alternative development fee is less than the fees set forth in  15706 then the alternative fee shall be paid by the applicant if the alternative development fee is greater than the fees set forth in  15706 the fees set forth in  15706 shall be due 6an applicant may request a nonbinding estimate of development fees due for a particular new development at any time by filing a request on a form provided for such purpose by the coordinator  provided however that such estimate may be subject to change when a formal application for a construction permit for new development is made such nonbinding estimate is solely for the benefit of the prospective applicant and in no way binds the city nor precludes it from making amendments or revisions to any provisions of this chapter or the specific development fee implementing ordinances 7the calculation of development fees due from a multipleuse new development is based upon the aggregated demand for each public facility generated by each land use type in the new development 8the calculation of development fees due from a phased new development is based upon the demand generated by each specific land use within each phase of development for which a separate construction permit is requested 9development fees are calculated based on the development fee amount in effect at the time of application for a construction permit 10no new or modified development fee shall be assessed against a development for 24 months after the date that the city issues the final approval for a commercial industrial or multifamily development or the date that the first building permit issued for a residential development pursuant to an approved site plan or subdivision plat provided that no subsequent changes are made to the approved site plan or subdivision plat that would increase the number of service units if the number of service units increases the new or increased portion of a modified development fee shall be limited to the amount attributable only to the additional service units the 24 month period shall not be extended by a renewal or amendment of the site plan or the final subdivision plat that was the subject of the final approval if after the date of the municipalitys final approval of a development the municipality reduces the development fee assessed on development the reduced fee shall apply to the development 11for applications for a construction permit for a building shell where the actual use of the building is unknown the development fee shall be calculated based on the lowest intensity land use allowed within the applicable zoning district at the time the certificate of occupancy is issued and the permanent use is established the applicant shall be assessed additional fees if the actual use of the property results in a higher fee ccredits 1eligibility credits against the amount of development fees due for a

comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 cfr  405471 as amended 2if a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the director of utilities may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with  19102b6 and 19102b7 3if the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the director of utilities may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users 4if wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the director of utilities shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr 4036e 5aa ciu may obtain a netgross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this subsection bcategorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this section any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the following requirements are met 1either i the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or ii the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters  2credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere  3credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this section  and 4credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result 6when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the director of utilities athe city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user 1employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  2currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  3provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  4not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly

notify the director of utilities whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20% from its baseline production rates determined in subsection b6a3 of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the director of utilities will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 4continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to  19102b6a3 of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit cwhen developing equivalent mass limits the director of utilities 1will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  2upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 3may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to  19102f the industrial user must also be in compliance with  19113c regarding the prohibition of bypass 7the director of utilities may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards

the impervious land cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and ultimately increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition this runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants however stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites therefore the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to its ms4 and local surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting the citys ms4 and local water resources from urban pollutants reduction in conveyance capacities of flood control facilities and
