legislature of the state has in vtca water et seq as amended delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses a 91896 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage b 91896 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area c 91896 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands d 91896 definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this article shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section except where the context

face of a block being the adjacent street rightofway line from one street intersection to another street intersection where such streets provide crosstraffic circulation not culdesac streets in those instances where a loop street configuration is involved the interior block formed by the loop streets is measured center of such block and between adjacent street rightofway lines variations in the block lengths specified in this section may be considered by the city upon receipt of a request from the subdivider for a variance in those situations where a block may be adjacent to a major topographical feature such as a river canal bayou gully or ravine  a major drainage ditch or lake  a major rightofway or easement for highvoltage electrical transmission lines or underground pipelines  a public park or other publicowned and operated facilities such as dams reservoirs schools or golf courses  and privately owned golf courses and lakes when such golf courses and lakes are an integral part of the layout and subdivision design of the overall tract being developed in no instance however will the commission grant a variance indicating that a block adjacent to the conditions and features mentioned above is to be more than 2640 feet onehalf mile in length measured along the block face b major thoroughfares the maximum length for blocks adjacent to designated major thoroughfares must not be more than 1800 feet c collector streets the maximum length for blocks adjacent to designated collector streets shall not be more than 1600 feet d minor streets the maximum

the city and where such public street forms a stub street into adjacent acreage or where such public street lies along and parallel with the plat boundary and adjacent to acreage a onefoot wide reserve must be established within the street rightofway to form a buffer strip dedicated to the public between the public street rightofway and the adjacent unsubdivided acreage to prevent access to this public street from the adjacent unsubdivided acreage unless and until the city has had an opportunity to review the development proposals for such adjacent acreage and a plat of the adjacent property is duly recorded the conditions associated with the establishment of a onefoot reserve on a plat are contained in the following notation which must be placed upon the face of any plat where a onefoot reserve is to be established onefoot reserve dedicated to the public in fee as a buffer separation between the side or end of streets where such streets abut adjacent acreage tracts the

the dimensions of the easement or fee strip tied to all adjacent lot lines street rightsofway and plat boundary lines  and the recording reference of the instruments creating and establishing the easement or fee strip in those instances where easements have not been defined by accurate survey dimensions such as over and across type easements the subdivider should request the holder of such easement to accurately define the limits and location of his easement property within the plat boundaries if the holder of such undefined easement does not define the easement involved and certifies his refusal to define such easement to the city engineer the subdivision plat must provide accurate information as to the centerline location of all existing pipelines or other utility facilities
