accommodate new residential construction within the city 2 the city has the responsibility to provide parks and recreational facilities in the city park system residential construction occurring within the city impacts upon the city park system  therefore residential construction should pay its fair share of the cost of maintaining the citys existing level of service 3 development necessitated by the growth contemplated in the comprehensive plan will require improvements and additions to the city park system to accommodate the development generated by such growth and maintain the standards of service currently provided by the city 4 implementation of the park impact fee to require residential construction to contribute its fair share of the cost of required improvements and additions to the city park system is an integral and vital element of the regulatory plan of growth management incorporated in the comprehensive plan of the city 5 the imposition of the park impact fee promotes the general welfare of the citizens of the city of wilton manors serves a public purpose and is intended to provide a source of revenue to fund the construction of improvements to the city park system necessitated by growth as delineated in the land use and capital improvement element of the comprehensive plan 6 the city commission finds that the maintenance of the standards for the city park system as contained in the park impact fee study and the provision of the improvements and additions to the city park system benefits all residential construction within the city which benefit is in excess of the park impact fee and therefore the park impact fee shall be imposed in all incorporated areas of the city 7 the standard of service to be provided in the city park

intent a the city commission of the city of wilton manors desires to adopt an ordinance restricting rightofway canvassers and solicitors to certain streets and roadways located in the city because such canvassers and solicitors pose a danger to themselves and the public at large by interfering with the safe movement of normal vehicular traffic  and b according to the florida department of highway safety and motor vehicles 2007 florida traffic crash statistics report five hundred thirty 530 pedestrians were killed on florida roadways in 2007  sixtyfive 65 of those pedestrians were killed on roadways in broward county  and c based upon statistics collected by the surface transportation policy project the miamifort lauderdale area is one of the most dangerous areas in the united states for pedestrians  and d numerous types of rightofway canvassers and solicitors may seek to operate within the city of wilton manors including but not limited to children adolescents and adults who seek to collect money for school and community activities  vendors who sell flowers newspapers and other products  and people who seek donations or distribute written information  and e rightofway canvassers and solicitors approach motorists and passengers in motor vehicles engaged in travel on roads and are particularly susceptible and vulnerable to serious injury or death due to the speed and number of motorists who operate vehicles on busy roads within the city  and f roads are primarily designed for vehicular traffic and are not suited to safely accommodate rightof way canvassers and solicitors  and g according to 20082012 statistical data collected by florida department of transportation the city ranked 13 th in the state among floridas 121 small cities population three thousand 3000 to fourteen thousand nine hundred ninetynine 14999 for having the most pedestrian related injury and fatality accidents neighboring cities ranked 2 nd and 8 th in their respective classifications  and broward county ranked 2 nd in the state in having the most pedestrian related injury and fatality accidents  and h according to the wilton manors police department ninetythree 93 percent of all traffic and pedestrian accidents within the city occur on the subject roadways identified in subsection c including ninetyfour 94 percent of all pedestrianrelated accidents  and i the presence of rightofway canvassers and solicitors interferes with the safe movement of normal vehicular traffic  and j the road network in the city is substantially burdened by a high volume of traffic and road design frequently includes complex vehicle turn movements that demand a drivers strict attention  and k it is the intention of the city commission to use the least restrictive means to advance the significant governmental interests of traffic safety and public safety and consequently the city staff analyzed each of the major roads within the city and determined that the roads listed in subsection c below present an increased and significant danger for use by distracted drivers pedestrians and rightofway canvassers and solicitors and pose the greatest threat to traffic and public safety in reference to activities and use by rightofway canvassers and solicitors and therefore the city commission has determined that such activities and use by rightof way vendors and solicitors shall be prohibited on the roads listed in subsection c  and l it is the finding of the city commission that many other alternative channels of communication other than rightofway canvassing and

either a public water system or a public sewer system then approval of the development by the city will be contingent upon mutual agreement between the developer and the city as to how and when the city utility system will be extended to the development c if a development is approved without a utility being available then the provisions of subsection a above shall apply to future connection of that utility  102604 extension of city systems requirements related to extensions of utility systems vary depending upon whether the extension 1 includes only service laterals andor service connections or 2 includes new mains located between one 1 or more service laterals and a portion of the system depicted in the water andor sewer study or 3 includes a portion of the system depicted in the water andor sewer study 1 service laterals and service connections a if a main already exists in a rightofway abutting a property line but there is no service lateral or a replacement lateral is necessary then the city shall construct the service lateral and service connection and the developer or property owner shall pay a meter charge water only and a tapping charge if only a new or replacement water service connection is required then the city shall do the work and a meter charge shall be paid b if a new main also is required then both the main and the service lateral shall be constructed at the same time as the new main a water service connection may at the discretion of the city be constructed either at the same time as the lateral or subsequently if either one is constructed by the developer title to the completed product shall be transferred to the city in that event payment of the tapping andor meter charge corresponding to the transferred work shall not be required and this fact shall be stated in the connection contract the relationship between actual costs incurred by the developer and standard tapping andor meter charges shall be immaterial and no credits for any differences shall accrue to either the city or the developer if either the lateral or the water service connection is constructed by the city then the corresponding charge shall be paid by the developer 2 new mains not in water andor sewer study a in general any new facilities between those depicted in a water andor sewer study and the service laterals for a development shall be constructed by the developer at his own expense drawings and specifications shall be submitted and revised and resubmitted if necessary to the city director of public services for review assisted as he sees fit by recommendations of the engineer if the director of public services determines that any portion of the work must be an oversized facility then the developer shall obtain two 2 cost estimates for the portion designated to be oversizedone 1 if built oversized and one 1 if built to the size required to serve only the development where both sizes are as approved by the director of public services the director of public services also shall obtain two 2 such estimates the developer and the director of public services then shall negotiate both a contract for the utility connection which will indicate whether the oversized facility is to be built by the developer or by the city and a developers agreement which will indicate the amount of reimbursement from future construction charges to which the developer will be entitled because of the oversizing the specific properties that are considered to be the future beneficiaries of the oversizing and the specific formula to be used in calculating the construction charges to be paid to the city by the owners when those properties are connected to the system if the city is to construct the oversized facilities the developer shall be required to fully reimburse the city for all costs actually incurred including any costs for engineering services during design and construction that full reimbursement shall be due and payable at the same time as payment of the required connection charge any reimbursements back to the developer for oversizing shall not be made until the city has received construction charges from future beneficiaries of the oversizing as stipulated in the developers agreement b if mutually agreeable the contract for the connection might stipulate that the city shall construct not only the oversized facility but also all other new facilities needed to serve the development in this case the developer shall reimburse the city for all costs for design and construction of all work done by the city but he shall not receive any subsequent reimbursement from future users for the portions not considered to be oversized 3 facilities in general all facilities depicted in any master plan or the water andor sewer study are to be built by the city using funds already available to the city and without immediate oneforone reimbursement from a specific developer however it is intended that connection charges shall reimburse the city for those costs nothing herein shall preclude the city from entering into an agreement with developer to construct necessary facilities it shall be the policy of the city that the costs of such facilities needed for future developments shall be borne primarily by reimbursements to the city from those developments and that connection charges paid by those developments shall serve as an equitable means of accomplishing the reimbursements accordingly when determined necessary by the city commission the city will review projected future developments connection charges to be paid by those developments and projected costs of existing and new facilities needed to serve those developments after each such review the required connection charges will be adjusted in an attempt to ensure a approximate equality between the then current projected total connection charges to be received from future developments and the then current projected costs of facilities constructed to serve those developments b the ratio of any one 1 connection charge to projected total connection charges from future developments approximately equal to the ratio of the utility services that development is expected to receive from new facilities and the total services to be provided by those facilities c 1 it may occur that some of the facilities referenced in a water andor sewer study will be needed to serve a proposed development but the then current city construction program will not ensure that those facilities will be available at the time the developer desires to start his construction in such a case the developer may if he wishes request that he be allowed to assist in accelerating the construction of those facilities needed to serve his development upon receipt of such a request the city will attempt to negotiate mutually agreeable terms concerning whether the needed facilities will be built by the developer or by the city  who shall pay the costs of the construction  and how much if any of the costs paid by the developer will be returned to him in the future the amount of any such reimbursement will be negotiated on a casebycase basis 2 regardless of the size of the agreed upon reimbursement for a developers payment of the costs of facilities that reimbursement shall be made from future connection charges the reimbursement initially shall serve as a direct credit against the connection charges which the developer will be required to pay as established in this chapter in the event the agreed upon reimbursement exceeds his own connection charges then the remainder of the reimbursement will be made from future connection charges as they are received by the city from other developments 3 details of the reimbursement shall be stipulated in a negotiated developers agreement which will indicate the amount of the reimbursement the developer is to receive the period of reimbursement whether reimbursement shall be from all connection charges collected in that period or only from those collected from specified geographical locations and whether all or only a specified fraction of each eligible connection charge shall be used for reimbursement  102604 utility facilities serving development a prior to preparing any detailed plans for either water or sewer facilities to serve a development the developer shall submit to the city director of public services written notification of intention to connect to a city utility included with the notification should be a preliminary layout of the proposed development including general location and proposed size of all proposed utility mains both interior to the development and those necessary to connect to the existing system developer also should submit data as to projected water requirements both for daily use and fire flow and projected sewer requirements both flow rates and type sewage unless otherwise indicated it will be assumed that the developer intends to perform construction of all indicated new mains without regard to location b after allowing a minimum of two 2 weeks for review of his submittal by the city and the engineer the developer shall make telephone contact with the engineer to schedule a meeting with the director of public services and the engineer the purpose of the meeting will be to reach tentative agreement as to design criteria who will be performing the work and if there will be a need for any oversizing or special construction of any facilities at the same time the developer should request information as to whether his development will be subject to any construction charges because of any previous oversizing that had been considered as beneficial to his development c thereafter the developer shall submit to the director of public services a formal application for connection to the city utility using forms furnished by the public services department included with the application will be final construction drawings and specifications signed and sealed by a professional engineer registered in florida for all public facilities to be constructed by the developer and the required plan review charge upon review and approval of the application the connection contract and the developers agreement if required will be executed d if it has been agreed that the city is to perform any of the work then prior to the city beginning to prepare the design and construction documents for that work the developer shall make a deposit cash or check with the city equal to twentyfive 25 percent of the estimated total costs to be incurred by the city the deposit shall be made at the same time as submittal of the application for connection to the city system as soon as the city receives bids for its construction work the developer shall deposit with the city an amount which when added to the previous deposit equals one hundred ten 11 percent of the total city costs as then estimated this deposit shall be in the form of cash a check or letter of credit from a credit provider acceptable to the city finance director and in a form approved by the city attorneys office upon completion of the work a final accounting shall be made with the developer making a formal payment to the city equal to actual final total costs incurred and any unused deposit being returned to the developer e any connection charges construction charges tapping charges or meter charges which are due on each structure in a development shall be due and payable no later than issuance of a certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy for the structure or final inspection approval if no certificate of occupancy is required and evidence of full payment of those charges shall be a prerequisite of issuance of the certificate of occupancy any funds collected pursuant to these charges may only be expended for the type of capital improvements for which such charges were imposed calculated and collected f in addition to the above requirements the developer shall be responsible for accomplishing the following prior to receipt of a certificate of occupancy or a temporary certificate of

purpose applicability interpretations and definitions purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare consistent and nondiscriminatory sign standards the sign regulations in this chapter are not intended to censor speech or to regulate viewpoints but instead are intended to regulate the secondary effects of speech and especially insofar as those secondary effects may adversely affect aesthetics traffic or pedestrian safety the purposes of these sign regulations are a to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication for business organizations and individuals in the city  b to provide a means of wayfinding in the community thus reducing driver confusion and traffic congestion  c to maintain and enhance the pleasing look of the city such that it is attractive to businesses visitors and residents  d to lessen the visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the proliferation improper placement illumination animation excessive height and excessive size area of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic  e to curtail the size and number of signs and sign messages to the minimum reasonably necessary to identify a residential or business location and the nature of any such business  f to improve pedestrian and traffic safety  g to differentiate among those signs that because of their location may distract drivers in active traffic and those that may provide information to them while they remain in their cars but out of active traffic  h to protect property values by precluding to the maximum extent possible sign types that create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of other properties as a result of their size height illumination brightness or movement  i to minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and private property  j to establish sign size in relationship to the scale of the lot and building on which the sign is to be placed or to which it pertains  k to implement the provisions of the comprehensive plan as updated from time to time  and l to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations exh a 121305 applicability and effect a applicability a sign may be erected placed established painted created altered or maintained on public or private property in the city only in conformance with the standards procedures exemptions and other requirements of this zoning districts contain their own signage regulations that are unique to the applicable district where the provisions of this with the signage provisions contained within any zoning district the signage regulations of the specific zoning district will prevail to the extent of such conflict b effect the effect of this as more specifically set forth herein is 1 to establish a permit system to allow a variety of types of signs in commercial industrial and some mixeduse zoning districts and a limited variety of signs in other zoning districts subject to the standards and the permit procedures of this   2 to allow certain signs based upon their function small size and unobtrusive nature subject to the substantive requirements of this but without a requirement for a city sign permit  3 to provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances  4 to prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this   and 5 to provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this c transitional provisions 1 existing signs all signs legally erected pursuant to a issued permit prior to the effective date of the ordinance adopting this  or any amendment hereto may remain in place and in use subject to certain restrictions on modification replacement and other actions affecting signs not in conformance with the provisions of this as set forth in nonconforming signs 2 existing permits all holders of permits for signs issued legally prior to the effective date of this or any amendment hereto may erect the signs which are the subject of such permits within the times allowed by such permits and such signs shall then be treated as though they had been erected prior to the effective date of this such permits may not be extended or amended unless the sign which is the subject of such permit will conform to all of the requirements of this it exists at such time 3 existing violations all violations of the sign regulations repealed in favor of this remain violations of the ordinances of the city and all penalties and enforcement remedies set forth hereunder shall be available to the city as though the violation were a violation of this if the effect of this to make a sign that was formerly nonconforming become conforming then enforcement action shall cease except to the extent of collecting penalties other than removal of the sign for violations that occurred prior to the effective date of this exh a 121305 interpretation and computation of sign area a computation of sign area of individual signs the area of a sign consists of the area within the perimeter of the sign faces for signs composed of individual symbols letters figures illustrations graphics messages representations emblems forms or panels sign area shall be computed by means of the smallest square circle rectangle or triangle that will encompass the extreme limits of same b computation of area of doublefaced signs 1 the area of a doublefaced sign with sign faces that are parallel or the interior angle of the two 2 faces is fifteen 15 degrees or less shall be calculated using the area of only one sign face 2 the area of a doublefaced sign with sign faces having an interior angle of more than fifteen 15 degrees shall be calculated using the area of both sign faces added together to determine the total area of a sign based on the principal that all sign elements that can be seen at one time from one vantage point shall be counted in measuring signage area 3 signs with more than two 2 faces are prohibited c computation of height the height of a sign shall be computed as the vertical distance from the average elevation of the crown of the streets along the entire length of the property frontage upon which the sign is placed to the top of the highest attached component of the sign d computations based upon frontage on two 2 or more streets are allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage however the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lots total sign area allocation that is derived from the street or building wall frontage as applicable on that street e determination of primary street frontage in the event a property has multiple street frontages and these regulations require the determination of a primary street frontage the director shall determine which constitutes the primary frontage based upon consideration of the following criteria 1 arterial roadways generally constitute primary frontage  2 a roadway onto which a property has its vehicular access generally constitutes primary frontage as contrasted with a roadway onto which the property has no vehicular access  3 when one street frontage is at least twentyfive 25 per cent longer than another it constitutes the primary street frontage provided criteria a and b do not indicate otherwise 4 if the director believes the criteria above do not adequately provide guidance the director may take into account the nature of the vehicular access ie full access versus rightin rightout only traffic volumes using each access point and other considerations consistent with the intent of this provision as established by the nature of the criteria contained herein and the intent and purpose of this 5 if warranted after careful consideration of the above criteria the director may find that it is not possible to determine the primary frontage in which case the signage allowance for the primary frontage shall be permitted along all frontages satisfying the above criteria f fractional measurements any calculation that results in a fractional measurement shall be rounded down to the next lowest whole number for example if one sign is allowed per one hundred 100 feet of street frontage and a lot has one hundred ninety 190 feet of street frontage only one sign shall be permitted g distance separations required distance between signs and other required distances shall be measured in a straight line using the shortest airline distance from the closest point of a sign to the closest point of another sign or feature for which the separation is required exh a 121305
