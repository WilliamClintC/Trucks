results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage a1b  b 7610 eff 8510 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities

requirements the objectives of this chapter are 1 to regulate the contribution of pollutants in stormwater discharge to the municipal separate storm sewer system  2 to control the introduction to the municipal separate storm sewer system of spills dumping or the disposal of materials other than stormwater  3 to prohibit illicit connections and illicit discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system  4 to establish legal authority to carry out all inspection surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to determine compliance and noncompliance with this chapter  5 to establish procedures for enforcement of this chapter  6 to establish abatement and remediation procedures for this chapter  and 7 to establish penalties for noncompliance with this chapter  10608 applicability this chapter shall apply to all water entering the stormwater drainage system generated on any developed and undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by an authorized enforcement agency the stormwater system service charge shall not be imposed on the following types of property 1 cityowned highways streets rightsofway parks and open space and leased uses on cityowned properties 2 railroad rightsofway  10608 responsibility for administration the stormwater manager shall administer implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter  10608 ultimate responsibility the standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this chapter are minimum standards  therefore this chapter does not intend nor imply that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no

resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater or the stormwater drainage system said person shall notify the city in the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services in the event of a release of nonhazardous materials said person shall notify the city in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day if the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment the owner or

authority of the united states environmental protection agency provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit waiver or order and other applicable laws and regulations and provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the stormwater drainage system  10608 prohibition of illicit connections a the construction use maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the stormwater drainage system is prohibited this prohibition expressly includes without limitation illicit connections made in the past regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection b a person is considered to be in violation of this section if the person allows sewage
