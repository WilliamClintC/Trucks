reinforced modified or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost to provide coverage and capacity comparable to that of the proposed facility b the proposed antennas and equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usefulness of other existing or permitted equipment at the existing or approved tower or facility as documented by a qualified engineer and such interference cannot be mitigated at a reasonable cost c the proposed antennas and equipment either alone or together with existing facilities equipment or antennas would create excessive radio frequency exposure d existing or approved towers and structures cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably or are too far from the area of needed coverage to function reasonably as documented by a qualified engineer e aesthetic reasons make it unreasonable to locate the planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower or

upon an existing or approved tower or building towers shall be designed structurally electrically and in all respects to accommodate both the applicants antennas and additional antennas when overall

height of the tree line measured within 200 feet of the highest vertical element of the telecommunications facility notwithstanding the above additional height may be approved upon a finding by the drb that the additional height is necessary in order to provide adequate coverage in the town of richmond or to accomplish collocation of facilities and that the additional height will not cause an undue adverse visual impact on the scenic character or appearance of the area c towers antennas and any necessary support structures shall be designed to avoid having an undue adverse effect regarding aesthetic impact on scenic open space prominent ridgelines and hilltops in determining whether a towers aesthetic impact would be undue and adverse the drb will consider i the period of time during which the proposed tower would be viewed by the traveling public on a public road  ii the frequency of the view experienced by the traveling public  iii the degree to which the tower would be screened by existing vegetation the topography of the land and existing structures  iv background features in the line of sight to the proposed tower that obscure the facility or make it more conspicuous  v

the board to a specific person project and parcel of land the allocation is not made solely to a parcel of land and therefore does not run with the land during project completion after completion of the project or permit expiration however the allocation adjusted to the actual development constructed if necessary will run with the land b the transfer of the capacity allocation is prohibited unless approved in writing by the board at the original owners request c the board may approve transfer of capacity from one project to another and one owner to another provided the new project and
