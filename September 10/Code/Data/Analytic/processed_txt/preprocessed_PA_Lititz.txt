it seems every town wants to be like lititz everyone wants to live in lititz watch the fireworks in lititz and has probably handrolled a pretzel in lititz the streets of downtown lititz possess an inherent sense of place that has resonated for more than 250 years from the early 18th century moravian settlement east on main street to the 19th century opening of wilbur chocolate and the julius sturgis pretzel bakery century developments lititz has consistently evolved and changed with the times the early 21st century holds the same promise for lititz at this junction in its history looking forward to the tercentennial celebration in 205 what more can lititz achieve role of the master plan the role of a downtown master plan is to develop an understanding of existing patterns of development and growth potential two considerations are key  physical elements these physical elements include building mass space allocations and connections  community use these potential uses include the types of services needed by the residents of the community then looking beyond the existing physical elements and community uses of today the master plan lays out a specific vision for the future process the process used to develop this plan included collection of printed data  assembling and summarizing pertinent information to reaffirm economic and market potential including  1999

cover  existing infrastructure figure 2  the master plan study area existing land use map within each downtown building there are multiple floors with multiple tenants and uses for the purpose of this master plan the review focused on the first and second floor spaces office space occupies almost 33% of the first floor in the downtown buildings by including government and institutional uses the

required to accommodate the projected population growth within a threemile radius of the borough  household income within the borough mirrors the state median however income within a three mile radius is 25% higher than in pennsylvania figure 6  existing land cover in the study area an area of approximately 17 acres within the 67 acre study area is designated as 100 year floodplain by fema approximately 9 acres is mapped as floodway an area that carries the majority of the storm flow and should remain unobstructed existing utility review currently there are no problems with the water or sewer systems downtown the sewer system is comprised of all 8 mains and there are no capacity or surcharge issues the water main in main street is 12 which is one of the larger mains in town in the study area the portion of the water main in broad street is 8 there have been no capacity or pressure problems anywhere in this area currently there is capacity in the system to accommodate increased demand redevelopment demographic summary the basis for the demographic information is data for lititz borough a threemile radius around the center point in the borough and a fivemile radius from this same center point as shown in figure 8 summary demographic data is presented here for the numbers behind the summary please see the appendix  population growth rate in lititz is slightly higher than the rate of growth for the state of pennsylvania but the growth rate within a three mile radius is more than double the state growth rate similar growth is expected to continue  based on this growth rate approximately 152 additional housing units of various styles can be  according to 2007 demographic estimates the most affluent neighborhoods are approximately three miles south of the borough of lititz with average annual household incomes of up to $165000  nearly 27% of residents within three miles of lititz have attained a bachelors or graduate degree compared to 22% of all pennsylvanians market study summary data on spending patterns of those who live within these same geographic limits the borough three mile radius and fivemile radius was collected in order to identify existing spending patterns and identify what spending might be captured in downtown lititz figure 9 shows data on sales surplus areas and sales leakage areas a sales surplus shown in black indicates that

dollars were spent just where the consumers live this data indicates  lititz borough residents spend an estimated $875 million annually for retail goods and services those who live within a threemile radius spend $279 million annually and those who live in the fivemile radius spent $7167 million annually  lititz borough residents spend an estimated $115 million annually for food away from home eg eating out within a threemile radius residents spend $358 million annually and $1193 million within a fivemile radius  within a threemile radius of lititz spending patterns and local sales estimates

retail shops found in downtown lititz these are potential clusters that could be built upon  new downtown development should focus on the local market heritage tourists are typically looking for a local experience if downtown lititz businesses truly reflect the character of local residents they will also be attractive to tourists in addition to residents and tourists lititz is also host to a healthy workforce of approximately 6000 workers using national averages and raw local data day time work force spending can be estimated and is shown in figure 10 figure 10  estimated workforce spending guiding principles the master plan will enhance the offerings of downtown lititz of properties without adversely affecting the current business structure our three overarching goals are expand social cultural and retail offerings for residents while accommodating visitors and tourists lititz is a real functioning community and the master plan will sustain this by focusing on the needs of the residents both present and future first currently 18% of the available land in the borough is not taxable the borough is fortunate to have schools churches and civic enterprises to add to the richness of our town but it is important to offset this situation by creating an increased tax base in order to continue to provide quality services to our residents although the downtown core appears to be well ordered and builtout taking a step back in history brings the realization that downtown lititz today is vastly different than 100 75 50 or even 25 years ago in some cases critical building mass has been lost and with it the feel of a completely continuous streetscape and downtown experience the planning process should look to our past to create a healthy and viable future and in the case of physical development that means filling in the holes and maximizing the use of our available space with this reference point in mind there is room to enhance and grow to meet the current and anticipated needs of the lititz community within the existing context of the downtown it is the missed and under utilized opportunities that are the focus of this master plan 1 downtown lititz master plan 72 integrate the lititz run corridor and other civic spaces into the connected fabric of the downtown lititz springs park has long been the jewel of the lititz community however although the park is adjacent to the downtown daily activties that occur in the park are usually not an integral part of the downtown experience lititz run  which runs middle of the community  is considered an asset but little has been done to celebrate its existence many locations have even turned their back on it and added to its degradation therefore a key element of this master plan is to realize the prominence of our current open space and natural assets and weave them into the fabric of the thriving downtown so that each supports the other and their boundaries are indistinguishable at the same time it is important to protect our natural assets and resources this can be accomplished green design practices regarding other connections lititz is already a walkable community a continuous streetscape treatment that creates a system of walkways and circuits will enhance walkability even more alleys should assume their rightful position as service providers to the businesses fronting on the main streets but the alleys should also be enhanced to add visual quality to the downtown and provide a clean safe and green pedestrian route figure 11  integrating the lititz run corridor is a guiding master plan principle 3 establish a parking strategy parking or room for surface parking is currently a major limitation for expansion of the downtown creating adequate parking will require new methods to meet the expanded need there is no more land area to pave over in the downtown and even if there was space available more surface parking is not the appropriate approach figure 12  an example of structured parking with retail uses on the first floor and parking and mixed use units above figure 13  another example of a parking structure adding architectural value to the streetscape 2 downtown lititz master plan 82 master plan the strategies set forth in the downtown lititz master plan fulfill the intent of the guiding principles as outlined here 1 expand the social cultural and retail offerings for residents while accommodating visitors and tourists  establish a mixed use district for the entire study area  increase density of buildings and uses in the core district of the study area  redevelop underutilized facilities  reserve the 1st floor for retail uses  encourage infill  redevelop properties along lititz run and the rail line including the susquehanna bank property and the long and bomberger property  remove parking from the flood way  look to our past and the committment to preserve the buildings that give the community its character historic preservation is an important component of any effort to promote sustainable development the conservation and improvement of our existing built resources  including adaptive reuse of historic and older buildings greening the existing building stock and reinvestment in our historic community  is crucial  further from the core district reduce density of buildings and intensity of use  capitalize on the existing street and alley patterns to strengthen circulation and massing of buildings  reestablish the alley network for service access and pedestrian travel  expand housing opportunities within the study area  add housing to upper floors throughout  provide a variety of housing types and living units  celebrate and integrate the arts within the fabric of the downtown sculptureart music and entertainment 2 integrate the lititz run corridor and other civic spaces into the connected fabric of the downtown  provide a hierarchy of green space open space and pedestrian routes throughout the downtown  maintain lititz springs park as the largest green and civic space in the downtown  develop the lititz run corridor as a linear green space for passive and active recreation  extend pathway or walk system along the corridor for connection to existing trails in the community  create a new more structured open space on the long and bomberger property  add outdoor dining seating window boxes and container plantings to extend the parklike feel throughout the downtown as well as green and soften the hardscape of the core district  front buildings along the stream and provide visual access to lititz run  encourage sustainable design practices including the use of green roofs green alleys green surface parking and pervious paving as well as other best management practices 3 establish a parking strategy  develop opportunities for shared parking  consolidate existing parking areas to the rear of buildings on main and broad streets making use of the existing alley network  locate a parking structure to the rear of the parkview hotel along north lane figure 14  the downtown lititz master plan graphic downtown lititz master plan 9 downtown lititz master

and the vision for how it will appear when the guiding principles of the master plan are realized utilizing the strategies outlined in the plan on the following pages are additional graphics that further illustrate the plan strategies and show suggested implementation scenarios in key areas of the downtown downtown lititz master plan 1110 focus areas central business district main street from broad to cedar is the heart of the downtown and as a result should be enhanced and strengthened to assume the role most would recognize this particular part of downtown as the central business district characterized by two and three story buildings the first floors of many of these structures are currently occupied by retail uses while the upper floors are occupied by residential or office space the plan expands the existing main street retail business base by activating the lititz run corridor broad to cedar in addition retail uses should be introduced into this area that tie back to main street specifically offerings on figure 16  plan view of the central business district figure 17  zum anker alley today figure 18  making use of the zum anker alley for outside dining affords opportunity to connect with the street and enhance the social aspects of the downtown broad street and sturgis lane increased business frontage along each of these streets will serve as connectors and further frame the limits of the central business district to further connect all points of the downtown additional built space will occur along sturgis lane from main street to lititz run and along kleine lane by using the alleys to add new construction the historic core remains intact while adding necessary density to the area additionally the new buildings may be constructed integrally with a multistory parking structure which by location will serve the surrounding mixeduse developments downtown lititz master plan 1210 focus areas increased density will be made possible by providing a parking structure of three to five levels off north lane that matches the building heights of main street the existence of this new structure will allow many of the existing surface lots to be removed and redeveloped for enhanced green space and new business space east on main street heading further east on main street the area from cedar street to cherry lane includes many properties that are very residential in scale and architectural style in order to focus the majority of new business and retail space in the core business district this area should remain predominantly residential but could include a limited mix of convenience and service retail to serve the surrounding neighborhood as well as limited hospitality entertainment and office uses figure 19  an example of an existing prime heritage tourism location figure 20  the existing architectural heritage should be preserved figure 21  properties that are residential in scale and architectural style are prevalent in this area

be relegated to the upper floors where feasible north broad street the area of north broad street from kleine lane to lincoln avenue provides a linkage and entry point to the downtown along the busy route 501 corridor the building stock is an eclectic mix of row homes and small commercial structures that house a mix of food service establishments as well as some limited specialty retail this part of north broad street is at times considered an island detached from the core of the downtown due to numerous visual obstructions  the rail line and several large parking areas as well as breaks in the architectural faade and uses as with south broad street based on high traffic volumes a mix of convenience and service retail restaurants and residential units can be created in this area with services provided for local residents and the workforce of downtown providing infill development will strengthen the existing retail identity while linking this area to the central business district downtown lititz master plan 1610 kready property focus areas a dynamic new residential neighborhood research based on current growth rates has indicated that an additional 152 new housing units could be supported in the borough of lititz over the next five 5 years this area of the plan from cedar to water street and north lane to kleine lane is nearer to the existing residential fabric and therefore has a unique spatial identity currently a large portion of this area is occupied by surface parking and the rail line to capitalize on the proximity and value of the lititz run and the adjacent residential neighborhoods the plan proposes to accommodate the potential growth with a maximum of 225 units creating a dynamic new neighborhood limited mixeduse development along the existing street frontage is also encouraged in addition the plan continues to incorporate parks and civic spaces in this zone the kready property located at the edge of the study area should be developed as a destination hospitality venue or a condostyle residential property in either case redeveloping this property in this manner will provide a necessary link between the residential fabric the heritage tourism destinations in the area and ultimately the central business district figure 30  shipoke in harrisburg pa is an example of a residential neighborhood where all new units were built with

larger lots to gain effciency of use and circulation landscaping and buffering should be added to these consolidated lots for aesthetic appeal and to support sustainable design practices two examples of lot consolidation appear here in figures 43 and 44 as presented in the master plan each lot now contains a more logical parking layout and serves multiple retail or office enterprises in addition by using consolidated lots we gain parking the existing layout behind the businesses focus areas on main street yields 80 spaces with consolidation the area yields 100 parking spaces the existing layout to the rear of the businesses on s broad street yields 32 spaces with consolidation the same area yields 90 parking spaces the longterm parking solution involves providing vertical parking
