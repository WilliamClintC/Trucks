has found that 1the waters of the state are of limited supply and are subject to ever increasing demands  2the continuation of californias economic prosperity is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses  3it is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource  4landscapes are essential to the quality of life in california by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water preventing erosion offering fire protection and replacing ecosystems lost to development  5landscape design installation maintenance and management can and should be water efficient  and 6 of the california constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use of water bthe city of brea hereby finds that 1orange county has an established large reclaimed water infrastructure system  2allocationbased and tiered water rate structures allow public agencies to document water use in landscapes  3incentivebased water use efficiency programs have been actively implemented within orange county since before 1991  4current local design practices in new landscapes strive to achieve the intent of the state model water efficient landscape use goals  5all water services within the city are metered and billed based on volume of use  6orange county is a leader in researching and promoting the use of smart irrigation controllers with more than twelve thousand nine hundred 12900 installations as of june 2009 and promotion of sustainable landscape transformation with more than thirty million 30000000 square feet of turf removal  7all new irrigation controllers sold after 2012 within orange county will be smart irrigation controllers  8landscape plan submittal

amending the solar rights act cal govt 5 the state legislature has found that 1in recent years the state has both encouraged the development of innovative distributed generation technology and prioritized the widespread adoption of solar power as a renewable energy resource such as the california solar initiative 2rooftop solar energy is a leading renewable energy technology that will help this state reach its energy and environmental goals 3to reach the states million solar roofs goal hundreds of thousands of additional rooftop solar energy systems will need to be deployed in the coming years 4various studies including one by the lawrence berkeley national laboratory show that despite the 1978 california solar rights act declaring that the implementation of consistent statewide standards to achieve the timely and costeffective installation of solar energy systems is not a municipal affair  but is instead a matter of statewide concern the permitting process governing the installation of rooftop solar energy systems varies widely across jurisdictions and contrary to the intent of the law is both an obstacle to the states clean energy and greenhouse reduction goals and a burdensome cost to homeowners businesses schools and public agencies 5the united states department of energy sunshot initiative has distributed millions of dollars in grants to local and state governments including california jurisdictions and nonprofit organizations to reduce the costs of distributed solar standardized permitting 6a modernized and standardized permitting process for installations of smallscale solar distributed generation technology on residential rooftops will increase the deployment of solar distributed generation help to expand access to lower income households provide solar customers greater installation ease improve the states ability to reach its clean energy goals and generate much needed jobs in the state all while maintaining safety standards bbased on the foregoing the city council hereby finds as follows 1residential rooftop solar and energy efficiency systems are a valuable renewable energy source enhancing the states clean energy and greenhouse reduction goals 2the city as the local building permit regulator in enacting this chapter is implementing a streamlined solar energy permitting process within its jurisdiction

board   variance athe issuance of a variance under this chapter is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of the variance bthe variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners cit is a priority of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure is built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate passed 12109   conditions for variances agenerally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf 12 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of chapters  and  of this division have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf 12 acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases bvariances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in   upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure cvariances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result dvariances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $25 for one hundred dollars $100 of insurance coverage  and 2such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the orange county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land ethe floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency passed 12109   appeal board ain deciding requests for variances the city council shall

and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges bvariances shall only be issued upon a 1showing of good and sufficient cause  2determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances cvariances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subparagraphs a are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance dupon consideration of the factors set forth in subparagraph a and the purposes of this division the city council may attach such

1alternative 1  average slope of the parcel or group of parcels for alternative 1 the average slope shall be calculated in compliance with  e2 for example a one hundred 100acre parcel which has an average slope for the entire parcel of twentyfive percent 25% would yield a maximum of one hundred 100 units 2alternative 2  use of slope categories cumulative land areas of a site corresponding to the slope categories identified in table a may be used to calculate site maximum density in compliance with the method established in  e2 land areas within established slope categories which are not proposed for development shall be excluded from the final density calculation said areas to remain undeveloped and set aside as natural open space and deedrestricted from any future development pursuant to the provisions of  e of this chapter the unitsunit per acre density used in the calculation shall correspond with the steepest slope category within the area proposed for development for example on a one hundred 100 acre parcel of which sixty 60 acres has an average slope of more than thirty percent 30% ten 10 acres are between 251 to 30 percent average slope ten 10 acres are between 201 to 25 percent average slope ten 10 acres are between 101 to 20 percent averge slope and the remaining ten 10 acres are under ten percent 10% average slope  lets assume you select the use of the land area within the two lower average slope categories the cumulative land area of twenty 20 acres from the two slope categories of less than ten percent 10% average slope and 101 to 20 percent

of mixeduse zoning districts 1mixeduse i athis zoning district provides areas for intense mixeduse urban environments that offer opportunities for people to live work shop and recreate without having to use their vehicles this designation encourages vertical and horizontal integration of compatible residential and nonresidential uses whereby the uses share the same structure or parcel the mixeduse i designation applies to downtown brea including the birch street corridor as well as other sites located throughout the community with ready access to major roadways and public transit land uses specifically prohibited within the mixeduse i designation include the manufacturing and processing of goods and materials and any warehousing public and private walkways and related facilities may be established within the mixeduse i designation bthe residential density range is 121 to 50 dwelling units per acre the maximum allowed floor area ratio far is 300 residential densities at the higher end of the range will only be allowed for developments that clearly incorporate a mix of uses 2mixeduse ii athis zoning district provides opportunities for the coordinated development of urban villages that offer a diverse range of complementary land uses in close proximity to one another either vertical or horizontal integration of uses is allowed with an emphasis on tying together the uses with appropriate pedestrian linkages residential densities at the higher end of the scale will be allowed for developments that clearly integrate uses bthe mixeduse ii designation applies to larger properties that would benefit from a coordinated integrated approach to development development densities and intensities at the upper end of the stated range will only be allowed for those projects that include public andor private educational facilities as well as functional and attractive public open space amenities land uses specifically prohibited within the mixeduse ii designation
