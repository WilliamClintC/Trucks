this paragraph the following requirements shall apply to any such buffer a no landdisturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural undisturbed state of vegetation until all landdisturbing activities on the construction site are completed once the final stabilization of the site is achieved a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a

however that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25foot buffer or they may be piped at the discretion of the landowner purusant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowners property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams the director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow landdisturbing activity provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications are implemented the following requirements shall apply to such buffer a no landdisturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural undisturbed state of vegetation until all landdisturbing activities on the construction site are completed once the final stabilization of the site is

city council of washington georgia does ordain as follows  findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of city of washington georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  2 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  3 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion  4 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and 5 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  objectives the objectives of this chapter are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  3 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas 4 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  5 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  6 to minimize prolonged business interruptions

exist in the at the editors discretion these provisions have been included as  90620 and 90621 general provisions a purpose the cd1 rusher street revitalization district is a character district established to promote the renovation rehabilitation and reuse of property in the vicinity of washingtons southwestern gateway the district provides a design overlay for residential and nonresidential properties that promotes traditional parcel and building arrangements which are pedestrianfriendly and human in scale fosters a lively mix of uses and generates interaction among neighbors building type standards incorporate traditional design elements that accentuate washingtons historic smalltown character while allowing flexibility in how such components are applied to individual structures in order to allow for contemporary interpretations of historic building forms b guiding principles the rusher street revitalization district provides the framework to implement the vision established in the southwest washington urban redevelopment plan to effectively implement the redevelopment plan vision interpretation of the provisions of this division should be such that the following guiding principles are advanced 1 the streetscape will be defined and framed by principal structures rather than parking or open areas 2 as the district develops building form arrangement and scale across streets should be complimentary and provide consistent streetscape definition 3 underlying zoning districts shall be limited to those with uses in which the design provisions of this division can easily be interpreted and implemented 4 layout and design of public spaces private property buildings and structures provides for the architectural compatibility of residential and nonresidential structures with applicable historic districts in washington 5 new structures will be oriented toward the street and other public spaces and to the rear of property  in order to provide visual security while subtly providing privacy to adjacent neighbors 6 openings and entries are oriented to encourage pedestrian activity and direct interaction toward the street space 7 the boundaries of parcels will be defined  whether by building structure landscaping fencing or other buffering  but will done so in a manner that promotes visual interconnectivity rather than concealing activity or serving as barriers 8 areas for vehicle storage and movement  and services and utilities  shall be largely kept from the street space c base zoning districts the rusher street revitalization district promotes the mixture of uses that would typically be found within a neighborhood setting while the form of development within the district will result in areas which assume a more urban characteristic the scale of development on individual parcels  particularly nonresidential development  will be limited uses that are regional in nature andor require the compilation of large development tracts or the construction of expansive buildings parking or outdoor storage areas are not compatible with the guiding principles of the district to reduce pressure for the development of property at a scale that is incompatible to the district only specific underlying base zoning districts may be used in combination with the rusher street revitalization district 1 permitted base zoning districtsmajor streets
