minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood

hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely effect the public health safety and general welfare d these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss e in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controlling the alteration of natural flood plains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  4 controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 preventing
