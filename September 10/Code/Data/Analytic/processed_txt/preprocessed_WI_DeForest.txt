details of potential contaminant sources page i 1 1 background the village of deforest has prepared this wellhead protection plan for the purpose of minimizing the risk of contamination of its municipal water supply this plan includes the three existing supply wells #2 #3 and #4 as well as three wells planned for construction in the future #5 #6 and #7 the village consulted with the wisconsin geological and natural history survey and the dane county regional planning commission to delineate zones of contribution as a basis for wellhead protection using the dane county groundwater flow model dcrpc 1977 the water system serves the entire village approximate population 8500 plus additional customers outside the village with an average demand of about 850000 gpd pumping capacities for the wells are well #2 well #3 well #4 well #5 well #6 well #7 350 gpm 1000 gpm 1400 gpm 1500 gpm anticipate construction in summer 2010 1500 gpm anticipated 1500 gpm anticipated values for wells #5 #6 and #7 are estimated from expected well construction and yields from the sandstone aquifer current pumpage from the existing wells is well #2 110500 gpd well #3 306000 gpd well #4 433500 gpd anticipated pumpage from all six wells projected for the year 2025 is well #2 310000 gpd well #3 310000 gpd well #4 310000 gpd well #5 310000 gpd well #6 310000 gpd well #7 310000 gpd the village has two elevated tanks with capacities of 300000 and 600000 gallons and treatment consists of chlorination and fluoridation well locations are shown in figure 1 and lithologic logs and construction details for the wells are included in appendix a this plan was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the wisconsin administrative 5 for wellhead protection planning  2 hydrogeologic setting deforest is located along the yahara river in northcentral dane county an area characterized by rolling morainal and drumlinoid topography bedrock lies beneath a cover of glacial drift of variable thickness consisting of glacial till with isolated deposits of outwash sand and gravel at well #2 the drift is 135 feet thick while at well #3 there is only 15 feet of drift bedrock below the glacial drift consists primarily of layers of cambrian sandstone dipping slightly to the southeast at some locations especially southeast of town where surface elevations are higher the uppermost bedrock is dolomite possibly trempealeau formation the sandstone is underlain by precambrian crystalline rock of low permeability at a depth of about 770 feet the sandstone sequence is divided into an upper and a lower aquifer separated by the eau claire shale an effective confining unit the lower sandstone has artesian conditions examination of the logs of about 70 wells in the area shows that nearly all obtain water from the bedrock the clayey drift covering the sandstone aquifer affords some protection from contamination provided that the clays are not breached by improperly abandoned wells although the drift thickness is as little as 15 feet well #3 nearly all of the well logs examined show some clay deposits similarly the eau claire shale provides protection to the lower sandstone wells #2 #3 and #4 are open across the eau claire shale it is assumed that future wells will be cased shale and withdraw from only the mt simon sandstone vertical relationships of the wells aquifers and discharge points are illustrated in figure 2 3 groundwater recharge and movement the direction of groundwater movement may be inferred from the slope of the potentiometric surface or water table and the regional topography shallow groundwater generally moves in the direction toward which the water table slopes it is likely that shallow groundwater flows toward the yahara river into which it discharges deeper groundwater in the artesian sandstone aquifer follows the slope of its potentiometric surface elevations of that surface are contoured in figure 3 and show a general southwestward movement of groundwater following the yahara river watershed comparison of water level data for the two aquifers shows a slight downward gradient across the eau claire shale at deforest krohelski et al 2000 groundwater captured by each well is recharged by infiltration of precipitation in an area extending upgradient from the well to a groundwater divide that lies north of town 4 zone of influence the zone of influence is the area encompassed within a calculated radius around a well representing the area of a cone of depression that would develop after 30 days of page i 3 continuous pumping at the wells capacity assuming that there is no recharge to the groundwater it simulates worstcase drought conditions in which the cone of depression would reach maximum extent the zone of influence depends on aquifer thickness permeability transmissivity and the pumping rate typical hydraulic conductivity values used in the groundwater flow model were assumed in determining transmissivity the zone of influence radii for the wells were calculated to be well #2 well #3 well #4 well #5 well #6 well #7 34260 feet  55073 feet  61343 feet  62500 feet  62500 feet  62500 feet  calculations of the zone of influence and supporting data are included in appendix b 5 wellhead protection area there are different methods of delineating a wellhead protection area ranging from a simple fixed radius to use of complex computer models the fixed radius depends on the pumping rate time of pumping and the aquifers porosity and thickness fixed radii for the wells were calculated to be well #2 well #3 well #4 well #5 well #6 well #7 808 feet  1366 feet  1616 feet  1690 feet  1690 feet  1690 feet  in another method the uniform flow equation is used to calculate the width and downgradient length null point of the recharge area for a well the zone of contribution delineated in this method depends on the pumping rate groundwater gradient and the aquifers transmissivity the zone of contribution area extends upgradient to the groundwater divide  however for practical reasons the upgradient extent of the wellhead protection area is limited to the distance of a 50year timeoftravel tot of groundwater to the well zone of contribution areas were determined using the dane county groundwater model dcrpc 1997 and the results are shown in figure 4 the areas were then enlarged to include the required minimum 1200foot radius around each well calculations used in the delineation of the wellhead protection areas are included in appendix b page i 4 6 potential contaminant sources as required by the wdnr potential contaminant sources within a onehalf mile radius of each well were identified by the wellhead protection team the village is served predominately by municipal water and sewerage although there are a few private wells in use within the village for which the village administers permits wells #2 #3 and #4 are surrounded by residential neighborhoods and parklands while proposed wells #5 #6 and #7 are in areas now used for agriculture the primary concerns at wells #2 #3 and #4 are overapplication of lawn chemicals fuel tanks and contaminated stormwater current concerns at proposed wells #5 #6 and #7 are agricultural chemicals and private septic systems improperly abandoned wells are a concern for all locations the locations of potential contaminant sources are shown on figure 5 and details of those sources are contained in appendix c further detail is contained in three reports by vierbicher associates 200 a b and c 7 land use management the village has a well abandonment ordinance and has drafted a wellhead protection ordinance which will be revised to conform to this plan in addition the village has extraterritorial zoning in the area shown in figure 6 an important method of reducing risk will be the program of education and public awareness discussed in the county conducts annual clean sweep operations for the collection of hazardous household wastes separation distances required at nr 81116 are included in the wellhead protection ordinance and will also be maintained for future structures villages building permit review and by the village planning and zoning commission in addition the township and county planning groups will be informed of the wellhead protection area and asked for cooperation in protection of areas outside the corporate limits the village will request incorporation of essential elements of its wellhead protection plan in comprehensive planning smart growth for the area in addition possible locations of future wells will be taken into consideration in land use planning 8 public education public awareness and education are an important part of the management strategy for this plan residents and businesses within the wellhead protection area will be notified by mail and informed of the importance of preventing the release of pollutants within the area in addition wellhead protection will be explained on the utilitys web site and articles explaining the wellhead protection plan will be published in the deforest times tribune and the villages enewsletter this plan will also be made available to the public at the village hall the utility department and the deforest area public library page i 5 9 water conservation water conservation by customers will be promoted distribution of educational material water bills are screened to find anomalous spikes in water use that might be caused by leaking plumbing water loss for the system is currently about 4 percent which is within the psc guideline of 15 percent for class ab communities leak detection surveys have been conducted and if future water audits indicate a substantial increase in unaccounted for water the village will consider the use of additional surveys the village has a meter exchange arrangement with its supplier which meets psc guidelines there are no unmetered customers in the village the only unmetered water uses are hydrant flushing water main breaks and fire department use 10 contingency planning if any well had to be shut down because of contamination or any other reason the others could meet system demand the projected demand could be met temporarily by any two of the six wells storage capacity is 900000 gallons which would provide about one days supply if all wells were shut down the village has natural gas backup engines at wells #3 and #4 and will provide backup power at future wells with all wells out of service for an extended period a connection could be made with any of the adjacent water systems bottled water is available at local stores the first responder to a contaminant spill would be the village fire department which has some hazmat training the nearest regional hazmat team is in madison 11 references bradbury kr swanson sk krohelski jt and fritz ak 1999 hydrogeology of dane county wisconsin wgnhs

planning & zoning administrator committee review planning & zoning commission attachments adopted wellhead protection plan background information the draft ordinance would establish a wellhead protection overlay district wp this new zoning district is in response to the villages recently prepared wellhead protection plan which was also included in the boards packet the intent of both the plan and proposed overlay zoning district would be to ensure that land uses and activities within a specified distance of municipal wells 1200 feet did not present unacceptable risk to groundwater quality there the proposed wp district regulates land uses and activities than may have an adverse impact on groundwater quality the district details conditionallypermitted uses and standards in which those uses are to be reviewed and requirements for existing facilities and land uses the proposed regulations reference models from other communities but are customized to reflect the conditions in the deforest area the planning and zoning commission recommended village board approval last year as part of the planning and zoning commissions recommendation village staff was directed to notify property owners that would be potentially impacted by the proposed ordinance staff recently notified those property owners and provided approximately one month for inquiry and comment i received a handful of phone calls inquiring about the ordinance but there was no identifiable opposition once the intent and content of the ordinance was detailed requested action i request village board action formal motion recommendation the planning and zoning commission and i recommend village board adoption of notice of newly enacted take notice that the village board of deforest wisconsin enacted  an a wellhead protection overlay district into the village zoning  this ordinance creates a wellhead protection district around village wells to protect groundwater quality certain land use practices and activities can seriously threaten or degrade groundwater quality this overlay district institutes land use regulations within wp areas on the zoning map the district is intended to protect groundwater quality and promote the health safety and general welfare of municipal water users authority for village adoption of this district and enforcement of associated regulations is established under 7a and c stats and nr 81116 wis adm full text of may be obtained at the office of the deputy administratorvillage clerk 306 deforest street deforest wisconsin or villages website at   clerks telephone no 608
