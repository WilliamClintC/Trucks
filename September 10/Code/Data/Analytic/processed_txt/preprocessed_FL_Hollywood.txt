monthly basis and the number of days in a monthly billing period may vary if the number of days in a specific monthly billing period is greater than 30 the maximum limit of each consumption tier will be prorated on the basis of a 30day month to allow for additional consumption in that tier specifically the prorated maximum limit will be calculated by dividing the applicable maximum limit of each consumption tier as provided in division c above by 30 and then multiplying the result by the actual number of days in the specific monthly billing period the result will be the adjusted maximum limit of each tier for purposes of calculating the charge for usage falling within that tier for the specific monthly billing period if the number of days in a monthly billing period is 30 days or less

areas and uses and intensity for nonresidential areas and uses the rules are designed to allow for local governments to make relatively minor changes to their adopted land use plans without a corresponding county action on the county land use plan which would otherwise be required to maintain consistency between the city and county plans bin order to maintain accountability over application of the rules the county map has been divided into flexibility zones which are geographic areas within which the rules may be applied totals for acreage of each use and the resulting density for residential land uses are compiled on tables for each flex zone and these tables are updated each time one of the rules of flexibility is applied the department maintains maps which

other natural resource systems land development and the need for public and private facilities of high quality although public facilities such as water sewerage drainage schools parks recreational facilities and roads have been and are being constructed in an attempt to meet the needs of the citys growing population the city has been unable to provide these services and facilities at a pace which will keep abreast of the ever growing public need and is now faced with the real possibility of a rapid dwindling in the quality of available municipal services and facilities 2because of the physical social and fiscal problems caused by this rapid growth the city has adopted a comprehensive plan to guide its future development so as to provide for the maximum orderly adequate and economical development of its future residential commercial industrial and public land uses and community facilities including transportation water sewerage schools parks and recreation drainage and other public facilities 3in order to insure that the comprehensive plan is not frustrated by disorganized unplanned and uncoordinated development which would create an undue burden and hardship on the ability of the community to translate this plan into reality the following objectives are established as the purpose for creating a planned unit development district ato utilize land more efficiently in new developments by employing smaller networks of utilities and streets thereby reducing costs  bto permit the phasing of residential development in concert with the efficient provision of public improvements and services  cto establish and maintain municipal control over the eventual character of development  dto encourage and maintain a desirable degree of balance among the various uses of

terrain agricultural areas marshes mangrove areas water and beach areas and other outstanding topographical and geological features  ito preserve and enhance the aesthetic qualities of the city  jto harmonize large scale development with adjacent uses and surrounding use districts in order to insure that such development will be in accord with the citys comprehensive plan not only for the immediate areas but for the entire city  kto enable a more creative imaginative and innovative design approach of the most advanced technological and land use planning methods available and permitting planned diversification in location and types of structures as well as combining and coordinating architectural styles building forms and building relationships within the pud  lto provide for adequate and suitable located open space and recreation areas of a size and type commensurate with the projected population density and nature of the development  mto provide adequate transportation
