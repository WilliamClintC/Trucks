following checklist is intended to be used to assist communities in reviewing transportation related issues during site plan review these standards could be added to the zoning ordinance as appropriate the standards are from many of the reference materials used in preparing the handbook the standards may need to be tailored to a particular community or situation offsite circulation & access the distance between the driveway and adjacent intersections or other driveways meets standards these access standards can be in the road agencies coderules or the zoning ordinance spacing based on posted speed limits is common example  230 feet spacing for 40 mph driveway is aligned with driveways across the street or offset at least 150 feet apart for local and collector roads or 250 feet apart along arterial roads or other specified access management standards driveway design is sufficient for the type of traffic expected and site conditions this includes reviewing the need for a bypass lane center turn lane deceleration lane deceleration taper and width and number of ingressegress lanes if site access is available via a side street or service drive access to an arterial should be limited or discouraged where appropriate is the length of the driveway sufficient to provide storage for vehicles waiting to enter or exit without creating conflicts driveway radii for both inbound and outbound are sufficient to accommodate the types of vehicular traffic that is expected to enter the site typically 2530 feet is the driveway grade too steep driveways or circulation roads should not have grades in excess of two percent near the main roadway approach ensure that pedestrian crossing is addressed if appropriate at all site driveways if a boulevard design is used carefully review island design including width length and radii also driveways likely to be aligned or nearly aligned with an existing or future driveway on the opposite side of the road should typically not include a medianisland is sight distance at the proposed driveway location sufficient will proposed signs andor landscaping obscure sight distance is this a location where a shared driveway frontage road rear service drive or connecting parking lots would be appropriate are such facilities recommended in a corridor plan master plan or zoning ordinance setbacks from future rightsofway should be noted is a rightofway dedication or preservation desired onsite circulation including pedestrians minimize conflicts near entrances such as cross traffic use of landscaped islands islands can also be used judiciously to control and slow traffic maneuvering large parking lot where public transit school bus or semitruck traffic is expected insure that the site designer has provided adequate internal radii to accommodate trucks or transit vehicles without conflicting with circulation or parking check using a turning template  a transparent diagram to scale which illustrates the turning radii for different types of vehicles review of emergency vehicle accessibility should also be completed ensure that traffic backing out of parking spaces does not conflict with traffic on circulation roads where islands are used at the ends of parking rows the design should discourage vehicles from backing out into major traffic aisles parking island design  the radii of parking islands should be shown to ensure vehicles can easily move parking lot the depth of parking islands should be about two feet less than the depth of the adjacent parking space generally intersections within the parking lot should be no more than threeway intersections and at most fourway avoid intersections with five or more approaches pedestrian circulation should generally be down the aisle parallel to or provided facilities minimize vehicular conflicts for pedestrians near building entrances traffic lanes should not abut the building  a protected area for pedestrians should be provided ensure that there is sufficient room to maneuver to pick up dumpsters without backing into vehicles parked on the opposite side of an aisle again use a turn template for driveensure that the drivedoes not conflict with maneuvering from parking spaces or traffic circulation are the number of stacking spaces on site adequate to accommodate expected queues maximum culdesac length should be considered community standards range typically from 600 feet to no maximum ite recommends a maximum length of 1500 feet for low density development up to 2 dwelling unitsunit per acre 1000 feet for medium density development 216 units per acre and 700 feet for higher density developments some communities and agencies in michigan specify a maximum number of units which can be served by a single access point usually 2550 units parking and loading parking lots should be shared to reduce parking area where the types of uses and their parking demand patterns make this possible are the required number of barrier free and regular parking spaces provided do their dimensions meet ordinance requirements while most ordinances address minimum parking some communities also consider the maximum parking needed often parking lots are over designed leading to excessive storm water runoff and poor aesthetics does sufficient space exist for snow storage parking bays or aisles should be aligned perpendicular to the building this provides better safety for pedestrians rather than walking between parked vehicles is barrier free access adequate is the loadingunloading area large enough and functionally designed with the proper surfacing materials is it separated from lanes loading areas and loading docks should generally be on the rear or side of the building not visible to a residential district or the public street nonmotorized facilities provision for nonmotorized facilities sidewalks and bike paths  adequate width suggest minimum 5 feet along local streets 67 feet along arterial streets  acceptable grade  alignment where sidewalk crosses driveway  connection between the street sidewalk and building entrances  barrier free requirements  consideration of pedestrian connections between residential developments  convenient pedestrian ways to onsite or nearby bus stops provisions for transit facilities if appropriate  if there will be onsite transit service adequate turning radii should be illustrated  location of bus shelters or dropoff areas  for larger projects request written comments from the transit agency pedestrian access across sites is typically overlooked along commercial strips pathways worn into the turf by pedestrians may demonstrate a need if sidewalks are not needed at the present time but may be needed in the future consider requiring a bond issue for future sidewalk construction this checklist completed by _________________________________________ date ____________ appendix b6 record drawing checklist effective  general 1 record drawings will show

drawings submitted to the town shall follow the applicable cad layering standards outlined in this document cad layer standards including layer descriptions line types and line colors are provided in this document these layering standards must always be followed for building projects use only aia layer names for civil projects use only the town layer standard use the minimum number of layers necessary to adequately separate entities in each drawing the number of layers contained in each drawing will vary depending on the scope and complexity of the drawing however drawings should not contain extraneous redundant or overly detailed layer names purge each drawing of unused layers prior to submittal the drawing file should contain only those layers necessary for displaying and plotting the information and drawing entities contained in each drawing to ensure that subsequent prints made from each autocad drawing match the original unused or unnecessary layers must be purged from the drawing prior to delivery the effective use of cad layering standards should allow users to isolate systems and drawing elements by controlling the visibility of objectsimproving system performance and eliminating visual clutter facilitate the sharing of information between drawings and disciplines allow users to control display and printing characteristics such as color line type line weight etc 16 entity properties to ensure the integrity of the original drawing when viewing or printing its essential that autocad entities are created following these standards entity colors

on engineering permanent record drawings the information is gathered during construction by field inspectors to reflect differences from original design drawings the corrected record drawings therefore become an accurate representation of site conditions for future reference 52  asbuilt versus revision asbuilt information is intended to reflect adjustments to the proposed design that are a result of actual field construction imperfections other changes involving unforeseen issues or obstacles ie field modifications may sometimes be handled as simple asbuilt issues as long as the following statements are true the change does not affect the intended function of the utility the change does not affect the intended function of any other utility the change does not affect the location of other related items such as easements all related town specifications and requirements have been met approval has been received from the associated town departments all other modifications necessitated by a variety of reasons eg extensions grade changes and alignment changes must be handled as revisions in accordance with the current town engineering design revision procedures 53  steps
