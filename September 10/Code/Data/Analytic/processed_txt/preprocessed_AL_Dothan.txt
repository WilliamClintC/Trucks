safety and general welfare of its citizenry ch 14 art i findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in hazards to property health and safety and may disrupt commerce and governmental services also this inundation can result in extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these potential flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other properties which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands

please note that left and right turn lanes can be required by the public works director even if the proposed development generates a lower turning volume than shown below in table 1 and table 3 these turn lanes may be required to mitigate traffic concerns ie roadway capacity or safety or if there are other traffic specific problems aggravated by the proposed development if a turn lane is required by the traffic engineer over 500 feet away from the developments entrance the developer can submit a traffic impact study providing information showing otherwise approved by the traffic engineer andor public works director to remove this requirement 1 left turn lane warrants the methodology presented here applies to all subdivision or development access points where a left turn must be executed from a twolane roadway to enter the subdivision the intent is to identify locations where lack of left turn lanes presents a potential safety concern the need for an exclusive left turn lane can be

technical explanation consisting of clear and convincing technical evidence must be provided to document the need to use any lower siting priority c the person seeking such an exception must satisfactorily demonstrate the reasons why a development plan approval or administrative authorization should be granted for the proposed site as opposed to a sites higher in the priority list d notwithstanding the priorities set forth in the preceding subsection a the city may approve any site located within an area in the above list of priorities provided that the city finds that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants and will not have a deleterious effect on the nature and character of the community and neighborhood conversely the city may direct that the proposed location be changed to another location that is more in keeping with the goals of this chapter and the public interest as determined by

total height of a new tower or support structure in districts zoned r1 r2 r3 r4 ra mh1 mh2 o2 o3 shall be 60 feet above preconstruction ground level unless it can be shown by clear and convincing technical evidence that such height would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service in the intended service area within the city the maximum permitted height is expressly not an asofright height but rather the maximum permitted height absent clear and convincing technical evidence of the technological need for a greater height e as the city has made the policy decision that more facilities of a shorter height is in the public interest as opposed to fewer taller facilities spacing or the distance between facilities shall be such that the service may be provided without exceeding the maximum permitted height f with respect to the overall designed strength of a tower but not with respect to height towers shall be structurally designed to accommodate a minimum

traffic calming purpose of article vehicle speeding in residential neighborhoods is one of the most common traffic complaints reported to the traffic engineering services division and the citys police department residents express their concerns about speeding in a number of ways which include the danger to children playing outdoors depressed property values increased noise and hazards to pedestrians and bicycle riders however manifested the concerns often lead to an effort to convince elected officials to take action to alleviate the problem with unwarranted traffic calming devices the purpose of this article is to present a criteria for reasonable and consistent evaluations as well as the applications of appropriate measures to control excessive speeding in residential areas  2607   42208 implementation the primary goal of implementing the proposed traffic calming measures is to reduce the impact of vehicles speeding in a residential neighborhood in order to do this the following procedure is recommended 1 initiation speed studies for locations can be proposed by any of the following individuals a mayors office city commissioners and the city manager b public works department head and traffic engineering staff c dothan police department d citizen request 2 data collection traffic engineering staff will conduct a speed study 85th percentile speed and volume study use existing traffic data or make field observations for the requested street the 85th percentile speed is the speed at or below which 85 percent of the observed free flowing vehicles are traveling and will be used as a measurement to determine if excessive speeding is occurring 3 classification the speed data will be analyzed to make sure that the data is correct and then will be classified into one of the following categories a class i minor measured 85th percentile speed is one to seven miles per hour above the posted speed limit b class ii major measured 85th percentile speed is eight miles per hour or greater above the posted spped limit 4 measures based on the classification of the vehicle speeds the following measures will be implemented a class i minor since the excessive speed is within the range of error of our equipment a traffic calming petition will not be issued b class ii major if class ii speeding exists then the traffic engineering services division may consider the following traffic calming devices 1 multiway stop a sign stop at each approach of an intersection to slow down vehicles along the main street it is the citys policy not to install multiway stops at tintersections 2 chokers the installation of devices to narrow the lanes to slow vehicles down 3 speed humps raised areas typically 25 inches by 22 feet by 12 feet made of asphalt that are placed in a series at midblock locations 4 traffic circles small islands in the center of an intersection edges are typically slope paved to accommodate larger vehicles and the center can be landscaped to be more aesthetically pleasing  42208 conditions for installing neighborhood traffic calming devices a specifications all traffic calming devices shall adhere to city specifications this includes but not limited to speed humps traffic circles and chokers b streets traffic calming devices will be considered for installation only on residential streets the length of the street must be 14 mile or longer c traffic volumes vehicle volumes must be at least 200 vehicles per day and not exceed 1500 vehicles per day streets listed on the mpo network map or supplement list in subsection g will not be considered for installation of traffic calming devices these include all arterials and collectors both major and minor within the city d speed the speed limit for the requested location must be 25 or 30 miles per hour e location of chokers and speed humps traffic engineering staff will determine the location and spacing of the speed humps or chokers factors such as lengths of the block driveways and storm drainage structures can affect the placement of these traffic calming measures f traffic calming study once completed there shall be a minimum of one year before another study will be

aggravated by the proposed development  2607 categories for tis based on the size and phasing of the proposed development the following categories of tis have been established 1 category i small developments which generate 100 or more peak hour trips but less than 500 trips during the morning or afternoon peak hour 2 category ii moderate size developments which generate 500 or more peak hour trips but less than 1000 trips during the morning or afternoon peak hour 3 category iii large singlephase developments which generate 1000 or more trips during the morning or afternoon peak hour 4 category iv large multiphase developments which generate 1000 or more trips during the morning or afternoon peak hour  2607 scope the level of detail needed for a tis depends on the size of the development and its phasing however every tis must address elements such as the study area the study horizon data collection requirements capacity analysis among others those elements are discussed here 1 study area the minimum study area shall be determined by project type and size in accordance with the criteria in table 2 the study area for the proposed development shall include traffic signal controlled intersections site access drives and major unsignalized intersections to ensure their operation and level of service are adequately assessed unsignalized intersections where at least one of the intersecting streets is a collector or arterial are considered major unsignalized intersections the extent of the study area may be either enlarged or decreased depending on special conditions as determined by the city traffic engineer 2 study horizon the study horizon years shall be determined by project type and size in accordance with the criteria in table 2 table 2 summary of design attributes by functional class study category developmentsubdivision characteristics study horizons a minimum study area b i small development 100499 peak hour trips 1 opening year 1 site access drives 2 all signalized intersections andor major unsignalized intersections within 14 mile ii moderate development 500999 peak hour trips 1 opening year 2 5 years after opening 1 site access drives 2 all signalized intersections andor major unsignalized intersections within 12 mile iii large singlephase development 1000 peak hour trips 1 opening year 2 5 years after opening 3 20 years

2 5 years after builtout 3 20 years after buildout 1 site access drives 2 all signalized intersections andor major unsignalized intersections within 1 mile a assume full occupancy and builtout for single phase developments b an enlarged study area may be required 3 analysis time period both the morning and afternoon weekday peak hours need to be analyzed if the proposed project is expected to generate no trips or a very low number of trips during either the morning or evening peak period the requirement to analyze such period may be waived by the city traffic engineer if the peak traffic hour in the study area occurs during a time period other than the normal peak travel periods these peak hours must also be analyzed 4 data collection requirements all data is to be collected in accordance with the latest edition of the ite manual of transportation engineering studies or as directed by the city traffic engineer if not specifically covered in the ite manual turning movement counts shall be obtained for all existing crossstreet intersections to be analyzed during the morning and afternoon peak periods available turning movement counts may be extrapolated at a maximum of three years with concurrence of the city traffic engineer the current and projected daily traffic volumes shall be presented in the report available daily count data may be obtained from the city traffic engineering division and extrapolated a maximum of three years with the concurrence of the city traffic engineer where daily count data are not available mechanical counts may be required at the city traffic engineers discretion roadway geometric information shall be obtained for all streets in the study area this includes roadway width number of lanes turning lanes vertical grade location of nearby driveways and lane configuration at intersections the location and type of traffic controls shall also be identified if appropriate traffic volumes should be adjusted to account for seasonal variations the use of seasonal adjustment factors should be approved by the city traffic engineer 5 trip generation the latest edition of ites trip generation shall be used for selecting trip generation rates the guidelines contained in trip generation shall be used to determine whether the average trip generation rate or equation should be used other rates may be used with the approval of the city traffic engineer in cases where trip generation does not include trip rates for a specific land use category or includes only limited data or where local trip rates have been shown to differ from the ite rates 6 trip distribution and assignment projected trips shall be distributed and added to the projected nonsite traffic on the roadway network the projected traffic volume must be shown for all roadways internal to the subdivision and for all other roadways within the study area the specific assumptions and data sources used in deriving trip distribution and assignment shall be documented in the study 7 capacity analysis level of service los shall be computed for signalized and major unsignalized intersections as identified in table 1 in accordance with the latest edition of the highway capacity manual for rural highways where the signalized intersections are more than one mile apart the level of service on the highway shall be estimatedin accordance with the latest edition of the highway capacity manual while the use of the operational methodologies presented in the highway capacity manual is always desirable analyses using the planning method are acceptable for dimensioning of new facilities 8 traffic signal needs an analysis of traffic signal needs shall be conducted for all arterialarterial arterialmajor collector and major collectormajor collector intersections within the study area for the opening year signal need evaluations must determine if an intersection meets the signal warrants included in the latest edition of the manual on uniform traffic control devices mutcd if the warrants are not met for the opening year they should be evaluated five years after opening for categories ii iii and iv traffic impact studies 9 accident analysis an analysis of threeyear accident data within the study area shall be conducted to determine if the level of safety in terms of accident rates and severity index needs improvement due to the addition of site traffic 10 queuing analysis a queuing analysis shall be conducted for all turn lanes under stop or signal control within the study area to ensure that the expected queues can be accommodated in the storage length provided although there are several methods for estimating queue length the following equations may be used for signalized intersections for every cycle queue length feet    2  25 feet veh  volume vehhrcycles per hour for unsignalized intersections for a 2 minute period queue length feet    25 feet veh  volume vehhr30 11 important analysis the roadways and intersections within the study area shall be analyzed with and without the proposed development to identify only projected impacts in regard to level of service and safety the minimum design requirements for all intersections and roadway segments shall be los d with no intersection movement falling below los d and no intersection turning movement falling below los e if the tis shows that the impact of a development will bring the los below these thresholds during the study horizon mitigation alternatives to improve the los to at least those thresholds must be analyzed as part of the study common mitigation alternatives include capacity improvements travel demand management and provision of alternative modes if the performance of the existing intersection or roadway is already below those thresholds eg below los d for  the study must find alternatives to at least maintain the existing performance the tis must also evaluate the need for turning lanes on all major unsignalized intersections using the criteria presented in the auxiliary lanes section 12 alternative modes in cases where pedestrian transit bicycle or golf cart activity should be expected the tis must identify any conflict points between vehicles and any other mode in those cases the study must also make recommendations to facilitate the operation of alternative modes and ensure the safety of their users especially at the interface with the vehicular network recommendations related to alternate modes should be in harmony with the goals of the plans especially in relation to the planning design construction and maintenance of bicycle and pedestrian facilities particular attention should be paid to  ensuring connectivity of pedestrian and bicycle systems  providing safe nonmotorized access to school for school children 13 responsibility the traffic impact study shall describe the location nature and extent of all transportation improvements required to achieve the required post development levels of service within the study area the responsibility for implementation of the post development mitigation measures shall rest entirely with the applicant  2607 sample table of contents for tis the following table of contents can be used as a template for most traffic impact studies the table of contents may be modified to better fit the needs of the particular study but the tis should at

criteria established in this article  12115 variances additional requirements a review criteria a variance may be granted by the board of zoning adjustment upon an affirmative finding that all of the following conditions exist 1 the requested variance arises from conditions that are unique to the subject property that are not ordinarily found in the same zoning district and that are not a result of the owners intentional action  2 the granting of the permit for the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents  3 the strict application of the applicable standards will constitute an unnecessary physical hardship not economic hardship or practical difficulty because the property cannot be used for an otherwise allowed use without coming into conflict with applicable site development standards 4 the variance is the minimum action necessary to alleviate the hardship or practical difficulty and observes the spirit of this chapter  and 5 the variance desired will not adversely affect the public health safety or general welfare or impair the purposes or intent of this chapter or the long range development plan b findings of fact before the board of zoning adjustment shall grant a variance it shall make the following three findings of fact which shall be recorded in the permanent record of the case and shall include the factual reasons on which they are based 1 that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this chapter in order to determine that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships the board must find that the following five conditions exist a if the provisions of this chapter are complied with a variance will only be granted if the applicant can secure no reasonable return from nor make reasonable use of the property merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify the granting of a variance moreover the board of zoning adjustment shall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of this chapter that will make possible the reasonable use of the property b that the hardship results from the application of this chapter to the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions personal actions personal circumstances or other hardship c that the hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicants property such as its size shape or topography which is different from that of neighboring property d that the hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly violates this chapter or who purchases the property after the effective date of this chapter and then comes to the board for relief e that the hardship is peculiar to the applicants property rather than the result of conditions that are widespread or common to adjoining owners or the general public if the properties were equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction then granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to others and would not promote equal justice 2 the variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter and preserves its spirit 3 in the granting of the variance the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice has been done the board shall not grant a variance if it finds that doing so would in any respect impair the public health safety or general welfare c conditions in granting the variance the board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location character and other features of the proposed building andor structure as it may deem advisable in furtherance of the purpose of this chapter if a variance for the construction or alteration is granted such construction or alteration shall be in accordance with the approved site plan 1 a variance issued in

plan a master signage plan msp is designed to benefit the community in administering its sign regulations the purpose of such a plan is twofold 1 it provides a master plan for all signs on premises  and 2 it provides a master record of all signs on a premises this provides the staff with information about existing signs on a site when considering a permit application for a new sign and also eliminates the need to recompute permitted sign area and numbers for a property every time a sign administration or enforcement question arises by requiring planning and coordination of signs on a property the streetscape will improve though strict and detailed substantive requirements are not imposed it is in a sense a pud for signs and imposes minimum area requirements so that it will only apply to large developments where a large number of signs will be present it can be used as an incentive by rewarding developers who prepare and follow coordinated signage plans for the property the provisions of the plan impose no maximum amounts of signage on the premises as a whole the standards for signage in the applicable zoning districts shall be used as a guideline during the approval process but certain deviations may be made depending upon the intensity and scope of the development if it is determined by the planning commission that the deviations are in keeping with the intent of this intent of the msp is to develop a creative approach to satisfying reasonable sign needs and not simply a means of requesting or receiving greater signage entitlements b criteria for consideration of a msp the provisions as set forth in this section may be used in lieu of the provisions for signage in all zoning districts only when all of the following criteria apply 1 the

center mixeduse development planned residential community public or semipublic use or a phase thereof 3 the premises has at least 200 feet of lot frontage along a public thoroughfare c sign permits no sign permit shall be issued for any signs within a proposed msp designated area or a phase thereof unless and until a msp for the premises has been submitted to the planning commission and approved as conforming with this section d msp submission requirements for any project or property wishing to take advantage of this section the owners shall submit to the planning commission an msp application containing the following 1 an accurate plot plan of the premises at such a scale as the planning commission may reasonably require showing a location of buildings parking lots driveways and landscaped areas  b an accurate indication on the plot plan of the proposed location of each present and future sign of any type whether requiring a permit or not unless exempted by the planning commission  c computation of the total sign area the area of each individual sign the height of signs and an outline of the building faades for which signs will be mounted this shall include all signs permitted for the applicable district and any additional signage area requested msp e master signage plan review a master signage plan application may be submitted with any site plan pud plan or other official plan required by the city excluding building permits land disturbing activity permits etc for the proposed development and shall be processed simultaneously with such other applications for developments containing more than one phase site or premises a msp shall be required for each site or premises upon development nothing in this section shall preclude any existing development meeting the criteria
