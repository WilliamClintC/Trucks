the city council finds as follows a that personnel from this city police and fire departments spend a significant amount of their time responding to loud and unruly events as defined in this chapter b that frequently police and fire department personnel are required to respond a second or multiple times to the same loud or unruly event after warning the person or persons responsible for such event that the event is being conducted in an unlawful manner and must be terminated and that frequently a response is required because those responsible failed to take the steps necessary to terminate such unlawful conduct c that frequently police and fire department personnel are required to respond multiple times to the same address for multiple loud or unruly events after warning the person or persons responsible for such events that they are being conducted in an unlawful manner and that frequently a response is required because those responsible failed to take the steps necessary to prevent the occurrence of further unlawful events at that address d that it would be appropriate to recover from the person or persons responsible for a loud or unruly event that costs incurred by the city for the police and fire department personnel participating in a second or subsequent response to an address in those situations in which such person or persons were duly warned at the time of the initial response that a service fee would be assessed against them if further responses were required due to the continuation of the unlawful event or the occurrence of future unlawful events e that the occurrence of loud and unruly events were alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by underage persons is harmful to the underage persons involved and a threat to public health safety quiet enjoyment of residential property and the general welfare underage persons often obtain alcoholic beverages at events that are under the control of a person who knows or should know of the underage consumption of alcohol f that in many cases persons having possession or control of property who are responsible for the occurrence of loud or unruly events on that property have failed to ensure that alcoholic beverages are neither served to nor consumed by underage persons that these events furthermore problems associated with loud or unruly events where alcoholic beverages are served to consumed by underage persons are difficult to prevent and deter unless the delano police department has the legal authority to direct the host to disperse the gathering g that law enforcement fire and other emergency response services personnel have and are required to respond sometimes on multiple occasions in the same calendar year to loud and unruly events resulting in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources and delaying official responses to regular and emergency calls in the rest of the city additionally underage drinking at such events has resulted in disproportionately

the following provisions apply a prohibit encroachments including fill new construction substantial improvement and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge b if a is satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter part 1999   nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature in general a properly issued variance is granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate part 1999   authority and conditions to grant variances the floodplain administrator is empowered to grant variances from the terms of one or more regulations in this chapter in the following cases a variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size which is contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the regulatory flood elevation providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections a b are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the floodplain administrator may impose other reasonable conditions on any variance mentioned in this section as deemed necessary to further the purposes of this chapter part 1999   special definitions for the purpose of certain terms and words are defined as provided in this section applicant means a person who has applied for a development permit or for approval of a subdivision map parcel map or variance application means an application for a variance under this section city means the city of delano city council clerk means the city of delano city clerk fraud and victimization means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public in examining this requirement the floodplain administrator will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the elevation requirement of subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs inconvenience danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring in addition future owners may purchase the property unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates hardship means the hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance the floodplain administrator requires that the variance be exceptional unusual and peculiar to the property involved mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional inconvenience aesthetic considerations physical handicaps personal preferences or the disapproval of ones neighbors likewise cannot as a rule qualify as exceptional hardships all of these problems can be resolved means without granting a variance this is so even if the alternative means are more expensive or complicated than building with a variance or if they require the property owner to put the parcel to a difference use than originally intended or to build elsewhere minimum necessary means the minimum necessary to afford relief to the applicant of a variance with a minimum deviation from the requirements of this chapter in case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the floodplain administrator need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade for example or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposed relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter public safety and nuisances means the granting of a variance must not result in additional threats to public safety or create nuisances this chapter is intended to help protect the health safety wellbeing and property of local citizens this is a longrange community effort made up of a combination of approaches such as adequate drainage systems warning and evacuation plans and keeping new property above flood levels these longterm goals can only be met if exceptions to the requirements of this chapter are kept to a bare minimum responsible authority means the officer or body with the duty of issuing any permit or rendering any approval required under this chapter which is subject to the regulations as to which a variance is sought part 1999   grounds for granting variance a in passing upon requests for variances the city shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  6 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  7 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  8 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  9 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 10 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b the applicant for a variance shall show at the hearing thereon and before granting a variance the floodplain administrator shall find 1 that there is a good and sufficient cause for variance 2 that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant 3 that the granting of such variance and any construction improvement development or other action which may be undertaken under it will not a result in any increased flood heights additional threats to the public safety or extraordinary public expense  b create a nuisance  c cause fraud on or victimization of the public  or d conflict with any other ordinance or regulation of the city 4 that the extent of the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard c it is recognized that under a6 of the national flood insurance program regulations the city is required to make a biennial report or as requested by the federal insurance administrator and report therein any variances which have been granted and that said administrator is empowered to review the findings justifying the granting of variances and that if said administrator determines that such variances show a patter inconsistent with the objectives of sound floodplain management said administrator may take action under b of said regulations to suspend eligibility of the city from the national flood insurance program d it is also recognized that under a of said regulations the issuance of a variance is only for purposes of application of the floodplain management regulations in this chapter and that flood insurance rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance and that construction of a structure below the regulatory flood elevation or otherwise inconsistently with the objectives of sound floodplain management may result in flood insurance premium rates on such structure beyond the means of its owner which are not modified by the granting of a variance e for the reasons mentioned in subsections c and d of this section it shall be the policy of the city to give the provisions of this chapter a conservative construction and application with the objective of avoiding wherever feasible the granting of any variance which would be inconsistent with the objectives of sound floodplain management or which may result in rendering residents of the city ineligible for flood insurance or which might place flood insurance beyond the means of the owner of a structure constructed under such variance part 1999   general

confined to environmental information c if the floodplain administrator determines that insufficient information has been provided to comply with any rules adopted pursuant to subsection d of this section or to permit him to fully understand the application for variance and its effect in the context of the proposed development or subdivision including but not confined to its environmental

11202017 specific use development standards purpose and intent 1 it is the purpose and intent of this identify land uses and activities which possess the potential to cause deleterious effects to the community in which they are located and to subject such uses to specific regulations with the intent of minimizing to the extent practical these deleterious effects further it is intended that in the zone districts in which these land uses are permitted they are conducted in a manner which is consistent with the protection of the public health safety and welfare in accordance with the goals policies objectives and implementation programs contained in the general plan 2 it is further determined that it is in the interest of public health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city to protect minors from viewing publicly displayed harmful matter and that pursuant to penal 1d and e the city is authorized to adopt ordinances which restrict the display of harmful matter to minors by the use of blinder racks it has also been found that there exists an increasing trend toward the display of harmful matter within the meaning of penal at grocery stores convenience stores video stores and other retail outlets as well as from newsracks and that restriction of public display of such harmful matter will keep the adverse impacts of such harmful matter upon minors to a minimum   applicability the provisions of this apply to the activities and land uses specified by this section in addition to any standards and regulations established by this title which may also be applicable to these specified land uses or activities   adultoriented businesses 1 applicability it is the intent of this prevent community wide adverse economic impacts increased crime decreased property values and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought about by the concentration of adultoriented businesses in close proximity to each other or proximity to other incompatible uses such as schools for minors churches and residentially zoned districts or uses the city council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of adultoriented businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the area and an increase in the crime and in addition the effects described above can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere it is therefore the purpose of this title to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of adultoriented businesses or their close proximity to incompatible uses while permitting the location of adultoriented businesses in certain areas 2 findings of the city council a the city council in adopting this ordinance takes legislative notice of the existence and content of the following studies concerning the adverse secondary side effects of adultoriented businesses in other cities american center for law and justice 1996  new york new york 1994  state of new jersey 1994  garden grove california 1991  tucson arizona 1990  seattle washington 1989  austin texas 1986  oklahoma city oklahoma 1986  indianapolis indiana 1984  houston texas 1983  beaumont texas 1982  minneapolis minnesota 1980  phoenix arizona 1979  whittier california 1978  amarillo texas 1977 cleveland ohio 1977  los angeles california 1977 the city council finds that these studies are relevant to the problems addressed by the city in enacting this ordinance to regulate the adverse secondary side effects of adultoriented businesses and more specifically finds that these studies provide convincing evidence that 1 adultoriented businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates in those areas in which they are located and in surrounding areas 2 both the proximity of adultoriented businesses to sensitive land uses and the concentration of adultoriented businesses tend to result in the blighting and deterioration of the areas in which they are located 3 the proximity and concentration of adultoriented businesses adjacent to residential recreational religious educational and other adultoriented business uses can cause other businesses and residence to move elsewhere 4 there is substantial evidence that an increase in crime tends to accompany concentrate around and be aggravated by adultoriented businesses including but not limited to an increase in the crimes of narcotics distribution and use prostitution pandering and violence against persons and property the studies from other cities establish convincing evidence that adultoriented businesses which are not regulated as to permissible locations often have a deleterious effect on nearby businesses in residential areas causing among other adverse secondary effects an increase in crime and a decrease in property values b based on the foregoing the city council finds and determines that special regulation of adultoriented businesses is necessary to ensure that their adverse secondary side effects will not contribute to an increase in crime rates or to the blighting or deterioration of the areas in which they are located or surrounding areas the need for such special regulations is based upon the recognition that adultoriented businesses have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or located in direct proximity to sensitive uses such as parks schools churches thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas it is the purpose and intent of these special regulations to prevent the concentration of adultoriented businesses and thereby prevent such adverse secondary side effects c the locational requirements established by this do not unreasonably restrict the establishment or operation of constitutionally protected adult oriented businesses that are provided by this ordinance d in developing this ordinance the city council has been mindful of legal principles relating to regulation of adultoriented businesses and does not intend to suppress or infringe upon any expressive activities protected by the first amendments of the united states and california constitutions but instead desires to enact reasonable time place and manner regulations that address the adverse secondary effects of adult oriented businesses the city council has considered decisions of the united states supreme court regarding local regulations of adultoriented businesses including but not limited to young v american mini theaters inc 427 us 50 1976 reh denied 475 us 1132  fwipbs inc v dallas 493 us 215 1990  barnes v glenn theater 501 us 560 1991  united states court of appeals 9th circuit decisions including but not limited to topanga press et a v city of los angeles 989 f2d 1524 1993  several california cases including but not limited to city of national city v wiener 3 cal4th 832 1993  people v superior court lucero 49 cal3d 14 1989  and city of vallejo v adult books et al 167 calapp3d 1169 1985  and other federal cases including lakeland lounge v city of jacksonville 5th cir 1992 973 f2d 125 hang on inc v arlington 5th cir 1995 65 f3d 124 mitchell v commission on adult entertainment 3d cir 1993 10 f3d 123 international eateries v broward county 11th cir 1991 941 f2d 115 and star v satellite v city of biloxi 5th cir 1986 779 f2d 1074 e the city council also finds that locational criteria alone do not adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and thus certain requirements with respect to the ownership and operation of adultoriented businesses are in the public interest in addition to the findings and studies conducted in other cities regarding increases in crime rates decreases in property values and the blighting of areas in which such businesses are located the city council also takes legislative notice of the facts recited in the case of k v inc v kitsav county 793 f2d 1053 1986 regarding how live adult entertainment results in secondary effects such as prostitution drug dealing and other law enforcement problems f the city council finds the following in part based upon its understanding of the documents and judicial decision in the public record 1 evidence indicates that some dancers models and entertainers and other persons who publicly perform specified sexual activities or publicly display specified anatomical parts in adultoriented businesses collectively referred to as performers have been found to engage in sexual activities with patrons of adultoriented businesses on the site of the adultoriented business  2 evidence has demonstrated that performers employed buy adultoriented businesses have been found to offer and provide private shows to patrons who for a price are permitted to observe and participate with the performers in live sex shows  3 evidence indicates that performers at adultoriented businesses have been found to engage in acts of prostitution with patrons of the establishment  4 evidence indicates that fully enclosed booths individual viewing areas and other small rooms whose interiors cannot be seen from public areas of the establishment regularly have been found to be used as a location for engaging in unlawful sexual activity  5 as a result of the above and the increase in incidents of aids and hepatitis b which are both sexually transmitted diseases the city has a substantial interest in adopting regulations which will reduce to the greatest extent possible the possibility of the occurrence of prostitution and casual sex acts at adultoriented businesses g zoning licensing and other police power regulations are legitimate reasonable means of accountability to help protect the quality of life in the city and to help assure that all operators of adultoriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and are located in places that minimize the diverse secondary effects which naturally accompany the operation of such businesses h the city council recognizes the possible harmful effects on children and minors exposed to the effects of such adult oriented businesses and the deterioration of respect for family values and the need and desire of children and minors to stay away from and avoid such businesses which causes children to be fearful and cautious when walking visiting the immediate neighborhood of such businesses  and the city council desires to minimize and control the adverse secondary side effects associated with the operation of adultoriented businesses and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods and businesses  deter the spread of urban blight and protect against the threat to health from the spread of communicable and sexually transmitted diseases i it is not the intent of the city council in enacting this ordinance or any provision thereof to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material and the city council recognizes that state law prohibits the distribution of the obscene materials and expects and encourages law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against such illegal activities in the city j nothing in this ordinance is intended to authorize legalize or permit the establishment operation or maintenance of any business building or use which violates any city ordinance or any statue of the state of california regarding public nuisances unlawful or indecent exposure sexual conduct lewdness obscene or harmful matter or the exhibition or public display thereof k the city council finds the following in part based upon its understanding of the documents and judicial decisions in the public record 1 evidence indicates that some dancers models and entertainers and other persons who publicly perform specified sexual activities or publicly display specified anatomical parts in adultoriented businesses collectively referred to as performers have been found to engage in sexual activities with patrons of adultoriented businesses on the site of the adultoriented business  2 evidence has demonstrated that performers employed by adult oriented businesses have been found to offer and provide private shows to patrons who for a price are permitted to observe and participate with the performers in live sex shows  3 evidence indicates that performers at adultoriented businesses have been found to engage in acts of prostitution with patrons of the establishment l in prohibiting public nudity in adultoriented businesses the city council does not intend to proscribe the communication of erotic messages or any other communicative element or activity but rather only to prohibit public nudity due to the secondary impacts associated with such public nudity  and m the city council also finds as a wholly independent basis that it has a substantial public interest in preserving societal order and morality and that such interest is furthered by a prohibition on public nudity  and n while the city council desires to protect the rights conferred by the united states constitution to adultoriented businesses it does so in a manner that ensures the continued and orderly development of property within the city and diminishes to the greatest extent feasible those undesirable secondary effects which the aforementioned studies have shown to be associated with the development operation of adultoriented businesses  and o in enacting a nudity limitation the city declares that the limitation is a regulatory licensing provision and not a criminal offense the city has not provided a criminal penalty for a violation of the nudity limitation the city adopts such a limitation only as a condition of issuance and maintenance of an adultoriented business permit issued pursuant to the city   and p the city council finds that preventing the exchange of money between entertainers and patrons also reduces the likelihood of drug and sex transactions occurring in adultoriented businesses  and q requiring separations between entertainers and patrons reduces the likelihood that such persons will negotiate narcotics sales andor transact sexual favors within the adultoriented business  and r enclosed or concealed booths and dimly lit areas within adult oriented businesses greatly increase the potential for misuse of the premises including unlawful conduct of a type which facilitates transmission of disease requirements that all indoor areas be open to view by management at all times and that adequate lighting be provided are necessary in order to reduce the opportunity for and therefore the incidence of illegal conduct within adultoriented businesses and to facilitate the inspection of the interior of the premises thereof by law enforcement personnel 3 establishment of an adultoriented business as used

follows a the proposed parking modification and use of the structure is necessary or desirable for the development of the community is in harmony with the various elements and objectives of the general plan and is not detrimental to existing uses or to uses specifically permitted in the zone district  b that approving the proposed parking adjustment and use will significantly improve the possibility that the structure will be preserved and maintained  c that the required parking cannot be provided without the approval of the requested adjustment  d that the proposed parking scheme will function safely  e that approval of the parking adjustment will not harm the integrity of the structure or the surrounding neighborhood 2 shared parking a a maximum reduction of thirty percent of the minimum parking requirements for individual uses may be granted by the planning agency where joint use of parking facilities or other factors will mitigate peak parking demand b requests for parking reductions resulting from joint usage shall be supported by information that generally follows the format described below 1 initial project review involves documentation and quantification of proposed land uses and anticipated functional relationships between the parking needs of different land uses the initial review will consist of data gathering regarding proximity to transit facilities general location of parking facilities surrounding land uses and mix predicted pedestrian patterns and similar variables which affect parking needs 2 adjustments for peak parking factor includes calculating the number of offstreet parking spaces required for each land use within the area proposed for joint parking use based upon the requirements of section  of this elements to be considered include seasonal adjustment for parking demand and a determination of the mode of transit used in reaching or departing the area being considered 3 analysis of hourly accumulation involves an estimation of hourly parking accumulations for each land use during a typical week day or weekend day 4 estimate of shared parking merges the hourly parking demand estimate to calculate the overall parking required to be provided within the area being considered for shared parking facilities c in granting parking reductions for shared use of parking facilities the planning agency shall make one or more of the following findings 1 the report justifies the requested parking reduction based upon the presence of two or more adjacent land uses which because of their substantially different operating hours or difference peak parking characteristics will allow joint use of the same parking facilities 2 the report indicates that there are public transportation facilities andor pedestrian circulation opportunities that justify the requested reduction of parking facilities 3 the report finds that the use otherwise adheres to the parking standards in this 4 the report finds that the clustering of different land uses is such that a reduced number of parking spaces can serve multiple trip purposes to the area in question d as a condition of approval to the granting of a reduction in required parking the planning agency may require the granting of reciprocal access and parking agreements with surrounding properties  recordation of conditions covenants and restrictions  or creation of other legal instruments to assure the permanent continuation of the circumstances under which parking requirement reductions were granted e where parking spaces are provided for an individual development on a separate parcel a joint access agreement will be required between affected property owners in a form acceptable to the city 3 transportation management plans a the number of parking spaces required for a project may be decreased up to twenty percent subject to community development director approval of a transportation management plan supplied by the applicant for those applications requesting more than a ten percent reduction said plan shall provide evidence that identifies the actual parking requirement and supports and justifies the parking reduction request such a plan may include but is not limited to car pooling van pools and staggered work hours b decreases in the required number of parking spaces approved pursuant to this subsection may be in addition to any other reductions allowed by this section c before approving such a request the community development director shall consider among other factors 1 projected effectiveness of car pool van pool staggered work hours or similar transportation management programs 2 proximity to public transportation facilities that could be reasonably expected to serve a significant portion of employees andor customers 3 evidence of the likelihood that employees andor customers will utilize regular transportation alternatives rather then individual use of automobiles including transportation management plans prepared pursuant to san joaquin unified air pollution control district requirements and of this title 4 low percentage of usable space a where buildings contain extensive areas of employee facilities such as but not limited to cafeterias racquetball courts health facilities covered patios multiple stairways and elevator shafts or atriums in multiple story buildings gross leasable space may be significantly below the eightyfive percent average assumed in the parking schedules in such cases a proportionate reduction in parking requirements may be granted by the community development director b to be eligible for reduction in parking requirements due to low percentage of usable space the applicant shall submit a detailed floor plan breaking down the proposed usage of all square footage within the building c as a condition of granting a reduction in parking requirements due to low percentage of usable space the applicant shall be required to sign an agreement stating that the percentage of leasable space will not be increased unless additional parking is provided pursuant to the requirements of this offsite parking facilities required parking for a development may be provided offsite under certain instances requests for offsite parking facilities shall meet the following requirements a the offsite parking shall be located so that it will adequately serve the use for which it is intended in making this determination the following shall be considered 1 proximity of the offsite parking facilities  2 ease of pedestrian access to the offsite parking facility  3 the type of use which the offsite parking is intended to serve recognizing that such facilities are generally not appropriate for highturnover uses  4 the need for locating
