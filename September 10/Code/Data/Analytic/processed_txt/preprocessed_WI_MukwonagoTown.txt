restrictions findings and intent a this article is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of a child or children from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations close to their residences the town board finds and declares that sex offenders are a serious threat to public safety when convicted sex offenders reenter society they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new sexual assault the town board further finds that given the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders and that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of reoffense there is a need to protect a child or children where they congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law near schools and other places a child or children frequent the town board finds and recognizes that in addition to schools there are other areas where a child or children congregate or play b this article is not intended to impose a criminal penalty or punishment of sex offenders but rather to serve the towns compelling interest to promote protect and improve the health safety and welfare of a child or children in the town by creating areas around locations where a child or children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers where sex offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from loitering andor establishing temporary or permanent residence and by regulating certain activities that may be used by sex offenders to prey upon children c due to the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders and because reducing both opportunity and temptation would help minimize the risk of reoffense the town board finds that there is a compelling need to protect a child or

lower phantom lake and adopted  regarding upper phantom lake spring lake and willow spring lake and codified in this chapter provided as follows lower phantom lake whereas  the town of mukwonago has within its corporate boundaries a beautiful spring fed lake known as lower phantom lake  and whereas  lower phantom lake is a 433 acre impoundment created and controlled by a mill dam on the mukwonago river  and whereas lower phantom lake consists largely of marsh land  and whereas lower phantom lake is heavily used mainly by the angler and wildlife enthusiast and its greatest attribute is as a fishery  and whereas the phantom lakes management district was given the power to protect and monitor the ecosystem and it is their conclusion that there should be laws that govern the use of the lake therefore  the town of mukwonago in the best interest of the public health safety and welfare deems it necessary that special regulations be adopted to protect life property and environmental quality of lower phantom lake upper phantom lake whereas the town of mukwonago has within its corporate boundaries a beautiful spring fed lake known as upper phantom lake  and whereas  upper phantom lake is surrounded by year round homes whose occupants enjoy the aesthetic beauty and serenity provided by the view  and whereas upper phantom lake is heavily used by anglers canoers sail boaters sail boarders boaters campers picnickers and water skiers to such an extent that the watershed suffers from overuse  and whereas the phantom lakes management district was given the power to protect and monitor the ecosystem and it is their conclusion that there should be laws that govern the use of the lake therefore the town of mukwonago in the best interest of the public health safety and welfare deems it necessary that special regulations be adopted to protect life property and environmental quality of upper phantom lake spring lake whereas  the town of mukwonago has within its corporate boundaries a beautiful spring fed lake known as spring lake  and whereas spring lake is a shallow body of water abundant with aquatic vegetation and supporting fish life  and whereas spring lake is heavily used mainly by the angler and wildlife enthusiast and its greatest attribute is as a fishery  and whereas the department of natural resources has stated that large portions of spring lake are not suited for motor powered boats  and whereas  spring lakes water quality is suited for swimming the gradual slope of the basin with a gravel and sandy bottom enhances the swimming potential due to the shallowness of spring lake at the shoreline swimmers must travel a substantial distance from the shoreline in order to be able to swim  and whereas  the marsh frontage contiguous with the open water of spring lake is a prime pheasant and muskrat habitat  and whereas wildlife observation opportunities are ideal as the aesthetic features are rated highly by the department of natural resources therefore  the town of mukwonago in the best interest of the public health safety and welfare deems it necessary that special regulations be adopted to protect life property and environmental quality of spring lake willow spring lake whereas the town of mukwonago has within its corporate boundaries a beautiful spring fed lake known as willow spring lake  and whereas willow spring lake is an impoundment of approximately 43 acres situated in an environmentally sensitive area  and whereas  the majority of lands adjacent to willow spring lake have houghton muck soils which exhibit a high erosion potential and wakes created by outboard motors could accelerate the erosion problem  and whereas the most prevalent macrophyte in willow spring lake is myriophyllum sp parrots feather this plant reproduces any broken pieces of this plant will sprout and start a new plant operation of motor boats weed beds will increase weed growth in willow spring lake decreasing the quality of the lake for sailing swimming and other openwater activities  and whereas  the wetlands surrounding willow spring lake have been classified by the waukesha county naturalist and the survey indicated that the environmental quality of the wetlands around willow spring lake were of exceptional quality and included observations of plant and animal species which would be disturbed by operation of outboard motors observation of ospreys great blue herons rookeries of little green herons and piedbilled grebes indicate the importance of maintaining willow spring lake in as natural a state as possible including minimizing wildlife disturbance by outboard motors  and whereas willow spring lake ice conditions are treacherous throughout the winter as numerous springs spring creek and the spring creek outlet modify ice conditions resulting in weakened ice cover and hazardous conditions for vehicular travel therefore the town of mukwonago in the best interest of the public health safety and welfare

area of lands which are zoned conservancy or ae exclusive agricultural district within the project may be used to augment the conservancy design development  or ii five percent of that part of the total project area which is zoned other than conservancy or ae exclusive agricultural district may be used to augment the conservation design development project density example existing conditions total area of project total area 180 acres total conservancy and exclusive agriculture lands total protected area 60 acres total area minus total protected area developable area 120 acres conservancy and exclusive agriculture zoned lands comparison twenty percent of the total protected area 60 acres   12 acres five percent of the developable area 120 acres   six acres analysis six is less than 12 so six acres can be added to the developable area one hundred and twenty acres developable area + six acres   126 acres assuming the developable area is zoned a1 and a1 allows one dwelling unit per 32 acres then 126  32   39 units 5 required standards as established by the town relative to road design drainage or other engineering parameters may be modified as part of conditions of approval as long

to all floodplains where specifically mapped and where structures are in existence as of the date of adoption of this provision of this chapter d the degree of flood protection intended to be provided by this division is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study this division does not imply that areas outside the 100year recurrence interval floodplain or land uses permitted within such areas will always be totally free from flooding or flood damages nor shall this division create a liability on the part of or a cause of action against the town or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this chapter  601 permitted uses the following shall be permitted uses in the efo existing floodplain overlay district 1 any use as permitted in the c1 conservancy district or the ae exclusive agricultural district 2 structures and uses including principal as well as accessory uses and

causes to any such existing structures the valuation of which to repair such damage would exceed 50 percent of its present equalized assessed value as computed over the life of the structure 82132 and including past improvements such structure may be reconstructed remodeled or rebuilt if the following standards are met 1 the structure is not located in a floodway as defined in this chapter 2 the first floor of the structure shall be placed at or above the flood protection elevation and reconstruction may occur on the same foundation or newly constructed foundation which represents no greater an encroachment or extension of the previously existing structure other than vertically such foundation shall be floodproofed and certified as set forth herein fill shall be used to elevate the first floor to meet the requirements of this subsection this fill shall not be less than one foot below the flood protection elevation for the particular area and shall extend at such elevation for a distance of at least 15 feet beyond the limits of the structure where such distance cannot be achieved because of lot lines or other similar constraints such fill elevation shall extend as far as is practicable resulting in no slope conditions at its terminus which may adversely affect surface water drainage on adjacent properties where the 15 feet of fill cannot be achieved as set forth in this subsection the structures shall be floodproofed to the flood protection elevation in accordance with the methods set forth herein and shall be certified as such by an architect or professional engineer registered in the state other methods may be used as long as they are certified as set forth in this section all floodproofing measures shall provide anchorage to resist flotation and lateral
