toward the rear of the pit under the air curtain the pit should not be overloaded  that is the material should not be piled up so high that it would protrude above the air curtain also no material should extend outside the boundaries of the pit and air curtain title 4  safety  step 6  maintenance and safety requirements ash removal is required in order to maintain efficient and proper

sedimentation control  allow erosion to take place and then control sediment before it leaves a site  stop erosion in the watershed project area by soil stabilization or runoff control measures  a combination of the two most desirable the following is a list of common measures that can be used to control erosion and sediment it is by no means an exhaustive list some standard drawings are included in this appendix and are referenced with the appendix page numbers additional drawings standards and specifications can be found in the current edition of the illinois urban manual an erosion and sediment control best management practice manual owned by the association of illinois soil and water conservation districts and the current edition of the illinois department of transportations bureau of design and environment manual construction site storm water pollution control chapter sediment control a perimeter sediment control measures to be installed between disturbed areas including stockpiles and property lines or drainage ways in order to protect offsite areas control measures should be installed on the downslope sides of the disturbed areas where runoff will leave the site slope range control measure comments less than 2% vegetative grass filter strips pg b4 no minimum width requirement 2% to <5% vegetative grass filter strips pg b4 10 wide minimum size should be

the type of inlet common measures include inlet protectionpaved areas dropin protection pg b6 inlet protectionmonofilament fabric barrier fence pg b7 inlet protection  log type pg b8 inlet protectionmanufactured above grade pg b9 c mud and dust control to prevent mud and dust from leaving the site common measures include stabilized construction entrance pg b10 dust control  sap water prime runoff control a concentrated flow areas temporary erosion control measures should be installed to protect drainage ways such as road ditches and waterways until the area is permanently stabilized common measures include rock checks for waterways pg b11 ditch check  rolled pg 12 ditch check  urethane foam geotextiles pg b13 erosion blanket pg b14 turf reinforcement mat pg b15 b pipe outlet protection all outlets should be stabilized to prevent downstream areas from erosion appendix b2 common measures include pipe outlet to channel pg b16 pipe outlet to flat area pg b17 c sedimentation control located where sediment laden water is discharged from a site or construction zone common measures include sediment trap pg b18 sediment basin pg b19 d diversions surface runoff from adjacent areas should be diverted around disturbed areas to stable outlets to reduce erosion due to surface runoff soil stabilization recommended seeding dates for central illinois are shown in

should be maintained until the vegetation is established november 15  march 1 4 sodding quick permanent cover to control erosion quick way to establish vegetative filter strip can be used on steep slopes or in drainage ways where seeding may be difficult anytime except when the ground is frozen 5 ground cover provides ground cover shrubs and trees in addition to permanent vegetation may be used as part of a final landscape plan along with shrubs and trees b nonvegetative soil cover 1 mulching added insurance of a successful temporary or permanent seeding controls unwanted vegetation and preserves moisture provides cover where vegetation cannot be established 2 erosion control blanket & turf reinforcement mat pg b14 & b15  provides cover and protects soil while vegetation is being established choose the material right for your slope and runoff and the need for the material to be temporary or permanent 3 aggregate cover provides soil cover on roads and parking lots and areas
