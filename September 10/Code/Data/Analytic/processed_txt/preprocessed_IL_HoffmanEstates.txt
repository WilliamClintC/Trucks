pedestrians and bicyclists 8 the physical and visible features of the street shall accommodate and communicate the intended operating conditions of the street the context of each street within a development village and region in general shall be taken into account in street design the village board shall have the authority to require features and elements of a street to be greater than the minimum standards based on the context of each street b street and roadway planning there shall be no specific rule regarding the layout of streets and blocks however the following shall apply to all streets blocks and development of any property in the village 1 connectivity to the existing transportation network for all users shall be considered when new streets are designed or when existing streets are reconstructed resurfaced or modified 2 block design must consider lot planning vehicle traffic flows pedestrian and bicyclists transit operations and public areas where appropriate or necessary for circulation andor compatible uses public rightsofway shall provide for safe efficient movements and access to future rightsofway and adjacent parcels 3 block lengths shall not exceed a maximum 1000 feet in length without an intervening street however an ideal length should be approximately 600 to 800 feet in unique circumstances the village board may consider longer block lengths as long as an intervening pedestrian way is provided near the midblock point to afford convenient access to schools parks transit and throughout the neighborhood in general in determining block length consideration shall be given to intersection spacing and design criteria 4 local streets within a neighborhood shall be designed to discourage use by vehicles whose trips do not originate or end within the same or an adjacent neighborhood 5 street classification shall be determined by the village board based on the intended function of each street within the villages street network and shall

or r6 rightsofway a minimum of 60 feet in width may be approved by the village board only if all public and private improvements utilities snow storage areas etc can be located and installed in accordance with village and utility provider requirements in some instances utility ducts may be required due to space limitations c alignment 1 the combination of horizontal and vertical elements of street segments influences operation and performance of streets the street alignment in residential areas should closely fit with the existing topography to minimize the need for cuts or fills while considering the crash frequency and severity potential for vehicles that run off the road the function of local streets in residential areas is to provide land access and therefore these streets should be designed to discourage street alignment in commercial and industrial areas should be commensurate with the topography but should be as direct as practical 2 horizontal alignment a the planning and layout of streets shall give consideration to the length of tangent sections with the goal of achieving operating speeds consistent with the intended function of the street between reverse horizontal curves the minimum tangent length shall be as shown or as dictated by superelevation design requirements long extended tangent sections of street should be avoided as a means to

referenced design speed minimum centerline radius feet 20 mph 95 25 mph 180 30 mph 300 35 mph 465 40 mph 675 45 mph 945 table note the values in the table above assume a normal crown section of 2 percent with no superelevation for curves with the normal crown removed or where superelevation is used other minimum centerline radii will apply see idot bureau of local roads manual and aashto geometric design of highways and streets for additional guidance c superelevation is typically not used on local and collector streets however if used the superelevation rate shall not exceed 4 percent d horizontal curves especially those of minimum radii should not be placed at the end of long tangent sections of street nor be hidden by vertical features of the road alignment or roadside 3

exceed 2 percent within 50 feet of a public or private intersection measured from edge of pavement of intersecting street vertical curves cannot be provided within this distance c the minimum vertical clearance shall be adequate to accommodate design vehicles at bridges structures traffic signals and other vertical elements d vertical curves  the design of vertical curves is based on the design speed of the road and the algebraic difference between longitudinal approach grades design standards such as the idot bureau of local roads manual reference k values for crest and sag vertical curves depending on design speed to determine the length state and national design guidelines provide details on these values but for reference the table below can be used design speed minimum length of vertical curve feet 20 mph 60 25 mph 75 30 mph 90 35 mph 105 40 mph 120 45 mph 135 e the minimum length of a vertical curve should be equal to 3 times the design speed where the algebraic difference between approach grades is 06 percent or less an angle point can be used with no vertical curve required 4 coordination of horizontal and vertical alignments  the development of the horizontal and vertical features of the street shall take into consideration the combined effects on sight distance drainage driver expectancy and intersection design the combination of design features shall not limit or obscure visibility such as a horizontal curve following a crest vertical curve or an intersection being located in such a way that a horizontal or vertical curve restricts sight distance d elements within the street right of way 1 travelled way a the travelled way consists of the area used for the movement of vehicles including lanes defined by pavement markings the number of travelled lanes will be based on accepted transportation engineering practice considering factors such as functional classification safety and capacity b the width measured from edge of pavement to edge of

has less than 30 percent deadwood in the crown one or two minor problems that are not eminently lethal to the tree and no significant decay or structural problems but the tree must have remedial care above normal care in order to minimize the impact of future stress and to insure continued health 4 fair to poor the tree is not typical of the species andor has significant problems such as 3050 percent deadwood in the crown serious decay or structural defect insects disease or other problems that can be eminently lethal to the tree or create a hazardous tree if not corrected in a short period of time or if the tree is subjected to additional stress 5 poor the tree is not typical of the species andor has over 50 percent deadwood in the crown major decay or structural problems is hazardous or is severely involved with insects disease or other problems that even if aggressively corrected would not result in the longterm survival of the tree 6 dead less than 10 percent of the

projects that integrate site layout landscape elements and building architecture to introduce visual interest and avoid monotony the guidelines are directed towards typical projects in a suburban setting the concepts outlined in the guidelines are intended to provide for coherence and visual complexity variety in the buildings and site design rather than develop a set of fixed standards for townhomes these guidelines provide flexibility for developers by allowing the use of different designs that address the guidelines the guidelines serve as a framework for the review of townhome projects this section is specific to townhome design issues  general requirements such as perimeter buffers park land donations street trees and other general development standards are contained elsewhere in the subdivision and zoning codes b design guidelines townhome developments will be required to have a design consistent with the following guidelines as set forth in this section in addition to other requirements of the village these guidelines represent a minimum the planning and zoning commission shall have the authority to recommend alternative designs in addition to or in substitution for the guidelines which equal or exceed the guidelines for final approval by the village board the overall design of the townhome development may be considered in evaluating the appropriateness of specific design features additional requirements may be required by the village board at the time of subdivision or site plan approval the overall design of the project should incorporate a mixture of the following elements to achieve a balanced design c homeowners association a homeowners association hoa shall be formed to at a minimum manage common landscape pavement and water management areas that are contained within the development other than those areas which may be accepted by the park district or other body as approved by the village board hoa documents shall be submitted at the time of subdivision review and shall include agreement to permit police enforcement of fire lane and no parking areas on private property funding of common maintenance responsibilities and responsibility for private maintenance of the development notice regarding maintenance responsibilities for common areas by the hoa must be recorded so as to provide ongoing notice to future property owners d landscape elements and site layout the overall appearance of a project depends heavily on the building arrangement and the landscape design the use of curved streets both onstreet and courtyard townhomes and strategically placed landscape features should provide visual variety and interest 1 building relationship to the street and street layout the orientation of townhome buildings to the street is of key importance in creating interest in the views from the street this is most easily achieved by varying the orientation of the buildings to the street so that regular patterns are avoided variety is key in providing an interesting view there are a number of means of achieving variety in the design curved streets that limit the length of views of rows of townhomes and create irregular spaces are an effective means of introducing such elements short public loop streets can also be used to limit views and create opportunities for landscape features courtyard buildings offstreet areas are another approach courtyard buildings should not be placed parallel to one another by placing courtyard buildings at varying angles to one another and by varying those angles from one set of building to another variety can be created within the development no more than two buildings should be placed on a single courtyard particular attention should be applied to opportunities to provide landscape elements at principle street view termination points by the positioning of gaps between buildings and driveways to accommodate landscaped areas miniparks the use of both onstreet and courtyard offstreet units can be used in conjunction with curved streets to create a visually dynamic site with limited apparent repetition articulated or l shaped buildings may be effective in certain situations the variety introduced into the site by the building layout should balance the inherent uniformity of the townhome buildings 2 driveway design and landscaping minimizing the visual impact of the driveways in townhome developments is challenging due to their close proximity to one another courtyard designs provide offstreet access to the garages of facing townhome structures the use of shade trees in parking areas courtyards is critical in providing shade and a softening visual element for large areas of paving such tree placement should be designed for the purpose of reducing the apparent areas of paving and provide for the maximum development of a tree canopy as referenced in the discussion on the building relationship to the street and street layout the creation of a variety of irregularly shaped spaces in common access areas will help add interest as well as areas for added green space pavement should be minimized while providing for 1 adequate parking in front of garages 2 maneuvering area and 3 emergency vehicle access as required common driveway approaches should not be excessively long the separation between driveways is of importance in both onstreet and offstreet designs this is often an area where providing sufficient green space for a tree is a challenge however such a separation is quite influential in unifying the site and reducing the dominance of the buildings and driveways a significant physical and visual separation should be provided between adjacent driveways sufficient to support a shade tree a minimum eightfoot wide green space should be provided between adjacent driveways the use of shared driveway approaches with separate parking in front of the garages may be used to create added green space in the front yards in certain cases such as with units that setback relative to other units in the building where feasible grade variations between adjacent drives and the use of different paving materials or edge treatments eg brick should be used to add interest to the site curbing should be provided a around all landscape islands in courtyard parking areas except those between unit driveways and b on the nose adjacent to common driveways of landscape islands adjacent to unit driveways in courtyard parking areas where there may be a risk of vehicles infringing into landscape areas all courtyard shared driveways are not considered public streets and shall be separated from the public street by a concrete apron all courtyards should avoid creating a cut path which would draw outside traffic courtyard shared driveway courtyards shall be constructed with the common driveways designed at a structural number of 25 courtyards should have address range signs visible from the public street 3 trees along street frontage of courtyard buildings landscaping in the open space between courtyard buildings and streets should provide filtered views of the building and courtyard parking areas 4 open space open space should be used to create visual interest in the site and include a predominance of shade trees a general minimum tree density is one shade tree 25 inch dbh for every 1500 square feet of landscape area not including trees in parking areas and street or access drive trees as required elsewhere in this  a shade tree should be planted in the front yard of all units while a variety of species and sizes of shade trees should predominate some use of evergreen trees and ornamental trees should be incorporated into the design for variety and seasonal interest evergreen trees should be planted in groupings rather than individually the trees and open spaces should be well distributed throughout the site and should include areas that can be utilized by residents 5 landscaping in rear yards rear yard landscaping should provide privacy to residents as well as semiprivate useable outdoor areas 6 grading and topography relief in the topography of a site can be a useful tool in adding visual interest a mix of unit exposures at grade walkouts and lookouts as well as the creation of views can be another element in the site design process that creates variety on a site 7 guest parking guest parking shall be provided as set forth in of this snow storage snow storage shall be provided as set forth in e of this townhome building design the appearance of townhomes from the street creates much of the character of townhome developments townhome developments are often dominated by views of driveways and garage doors it is important to introduce variety into the appearance among the units in individual townhome buildings there should be a balance among building materials building articulation and the use of architectural design elements to some extent increases in one of these factors can allow some tradeoff against others however all of the factors should be addressed use of the following elements are recommended to achieve this variety the inclusion of these elements is particularly critical where there are prominent views of the buildings from the street 1 use of a variety of architectural design elements vary the design elements of the front and rear of the units in a building there should be two or more elements that vary among units for three or four unit buildings three or more elements should be provided for five or six unit buildings eg dormers with and without windows siding brick or an architectural medallion avoid repetition of the same element across a large number of units in the same building avoid identical buildings in the same view within the site or adjacent roadways 2 building articulation the design should include articulation of the front rear and side particularly for street facing units building facades large expanses of undivided roof areas should be avoided the division of the roof by varying the heights of the roof sections and the use of dormers are examples of common approaches to addressing this concern the mass of the building should be varied to provide for visual complexity and interest 3 building materials a minimum of 25 percent of the front of the building should be brick brick should also be used to add visual interest to the rear elevation brick should be utilized in areas where it will be prominently viewed and contribute to the overall appearance of the structure the use of brick in addition to another siding material adds another color and texture to the building improving its appearance the meeting of materials should occur naturally for example brick should not simply change to siding at an exterior corner rather transitions such as at certain interior corners or in a wrapped corner to create a column are preferable 4 garages and front doors because the garage doors and driveways typically dominate the front of the townhome building it is important to lessen their visual impact the use of different building facade designs for adjacent garages can reduce the perceived predominance of the garage doors such designs can visually emphasize one garage and minimize the other thus reducing apparent repetition in the design significantly varying the projection of garages among units in a building can also help divide the mass of the building and create interest also the use of two single garage doors as well as double garage doors for two car garages adds variety front doors should be prominently visible to provide for both a human scale and a sense of security 5 style integrity the use of building materials and the building design should reflect a particular style the inappropriate mixture of styles and materials should be avoided 6 building size varying the number of units in a courtyard offstreet buildings from three to six can aid in adapting to a site as well as promote variety a maximum of one in six buildings may contain six units the number of units in a courtyard shall not exceed 11 in order to limit a large number of adjacent driveways and curbcuts onstreet buildings should be limited to four units six if endloaded units are used so that access to any unit over four must be from the side 7 foundation building landscaping landscaping adjacent to the building should complement the architecture of the building however it should not substitute for architectural character 8 building materials building materials shall be provided for as set forth in h of this attention should be placed on selecting materials that will not be subject to premature deterioration or require excessive maintenance exh a 31813
