finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including minimization of impacts of development redevelopment and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the township and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed poses a threat to surface and groundwater quality e stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality 0v 5 al4293 f impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality groundwater recharge stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems the most cost effective and environmentally advantageous way to manage storm water runoff is project design minimizing impervious surfaces and sprawl avoiding sensitive areas ie stream buffers floodplains steep slopes and designing to topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime g public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater h federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes i nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the township   purpose the purpose of this to promote the public health safety and welfare within the township of spring by maintaining the natural

e  low impact development lid practices   alternative approach for managing stormwater runoff natural hydrologic conditions may be altered radically by poorly planned development practices such as introducing unneeded impervious surfaces destroying existing drainage swales constructing unnecessary storm sewers and changing local topography a traditional drainage approach of development has been to remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a detention basin this approach leads ultimately to the degradation of water quality as well as expenditure of additional resources for detaining and managing concentrated runoff at some downstream location the recommended alternative approach is to promote practices that will minimize proposed conditions runoff rates and volumes which will minimize needs for artificial conveyance and storage facilities to simulate predevelopment hydrologic conditions infiltration is often necessary to offset the loss of infiltration by creation of impervious surfaces the ability of the ground to infiltrate depends upon the soil types and its conditions preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful alternative site design considerations site design practices include preserving natural drainage features minimizing impervious surface area reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces and protecting natural depression storage a welldesigned site will contain a mix of all those features the following describes various techniques to achieve the alternative approach preserving natural drainage features protecting natural drainage features particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels is desirable because of their ability to infiltrate and attenuate flows and to filter pollutants however this objective is often not accomplished in land development in fact commonly held drainage philosophy encourages just the opposite pattern  streets and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in the natural headwater valleys and swales thereby replacing natural drainage functions with a completely impervious system as a result runoff and pollutants generated from impervious surfaces flow directly into storm sewers with no opportunity for attenuation infiltration or filtration developments designed to fit site topography also minimizes the amount of grading on site protecting natural depression storage areas depressional storage areas have no surface outlet or drain very slowly following a storm event they can be commonly xxv 105 seen as ponded areas in farm fields during the wet season or after large runoff events traditional development practices eliminate these depressions by filling or draining thereby obliterating their ability to reduce surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants the volume and releaserate characteristics of depressions should be protected in the design of the development site the depressions can be protected by simply avoiding the depression or by incorporating its storage as additional capacity in required detention facilities avoiding introduction of impervious areas careful site planning should consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible building footprints sidewalks driveways and other features producing impervious surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces impervious surfaces are significantly less of a problem if they are not directly connected to an impervious conveyance system such as storm sewer two basic ways to reduce hydraulic connectivity are routing of roof runoff over lawns and reducing the use of storm sewers site grading should promote increasing travel time of stormwater runoff and should help reduce concentration of runoff to a single point in the development routing roof runoff over lawns roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns in most site designs the practice discourages direct connections of downspouts to storm sewers or parking lots the practice also discourages sloping driveways and parking lots to the street by routing roof drains and crowning the driveway to run off to the lawn the lawn is essentially used as a filter strip using permeable paving materials these materials include permeable interlocking concrete paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete such materials should be considered as alternatives to conventional pavement surfaces in privately owned and maintained areas especially for low use surfaces such as driveways overflow parking lots and emergency access roads the following describes additional techniques that may be acceptable under certain conditions to achieve the alternative approach their use is dependent upon additional factors such as zoning and subdivision and land development regulations and these techniques are to be employed only upon approval of the appropriate township entity reducing the use of storm sewers by reducing use of storm sewers for draining streets parking lots and back yards the potential for accelerating runoff from the development can be greatly reduced the practice requires greater use of swales and may not be practical for some development sites especially if there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a reasonable time the practice requires educating xxv 106 local citizens and public works officials who expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event reducing street widths street widths can be reduced by either eliminating onstreet parking or by reducing roadway widths township planners and traffic designers may give consideration to narrower neighborhood streets which ultimately could lower maintenance limiting sidewalks to one side of the street a sidewalk on one side of the street may suffice in lowtraffic neighborhoods the lost sidewalk could be replaced with bicyclerecreational trails that follow backoflot lines where appropriate backyard trails should be constructed using pervious materials constructing open space developments open space developments can also reduce the amount of impervious area for a given number of lots the biggest savings is in street length which also will reduce costs of the development open space development clusters the construction activity onto lesssensitive areas without substantially affecting the gross density of development in summary a careful consideration of the existing topography and implementation of a combination of the above mentioned techniques may avoid construction of costly stormwater control measures other benefits include reduced potential of downstream flooding water quality degradation of receiving streams water bodies and enhancement of aesthetics and reduction of development costs beneficial results include more stable baseflows in receiving streams improved groundwater recharge reduced flood flows reduced pollutant loads and reduced costs for conveyance and storage appendix f  west nile virus guide   this source is from the monroe county pa conservation district who researched the potential of west nile virus problems from bmps due to a number of calls they were receiving monroe county conservation district guidance stormwater management and west nile virus source brodhead mc michaels creeks watershed act 167 stormwater management 2304 the monroe county conservation district recognizes the need to address the problem of nonpoint source pollution impacts caused by runoff from impervious surfaces the new stormwater policy being integrated into act 167 stormwater management regulations by the pa department of environmental protection padep will make nonpoint pollution controls an important component of all future plans and updates to existing plans in addition to meet postconstruction antidegradation standards under the state national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permitting program applicants will be required to employ best management practices bmps to address nonpoint pollution concerns studies conducted throughout the united states have shown that wet basins and in particular constructed wetlands are effective in traditional stormwater management areas such as channel stability and flood control and are one of the most effective ways to remove stormwater pollutants united states environmental protection agency 199 center for watershed protection 2000 from maryland to oregon studies have shown that as urbanization and impervious surface increase in a watershed the streams in those watersheds become degraded cwp 2000 although there is debate over the threshold of impervious cover when degradation becomes apparent some studies show as little as 6% while others show closer to 20% there is agreement that impervious surfaces cause nonpoint pollution in urban and urbanizing watersheds and that degradation is ensured if stormwater bmps are not implemented although constructed wetlands and ponds are desirable from a water quality perspective there may be concerns about the possibility of these stormwater management structures becoming breeding grounds for mosquitoes the conservation district feels that although it may be a valid concern municipalities should not adopt ordinance provisions prohibiting wet basins for stormwater management mosquitoes the questions surrounding mosquito production in wetlands and ponds have intensified in recent years by the outbreak of the mosquitoborne west nile virus as is the case with all vectorborne maladies the life cycle of west nile virus is complicated traveling from mosquito to bird back to mosquito and then to other animals including 0v 108 humans cu lex pipiens was identified as the vector species in the first documented cases from new york in 1999 this species is still considered the primary transmitter of the disease across its range today there are some 60 species of mosquitoes that inhabit pennsylvania along with c pipiens three other species have been identified as vectors of west nile virus while four more have been identified as potential vectors the four known vectors in ne pennsylvania are cu lex pipiens c restuans c salinarius and ochlerotatus japonicus all four of these species prefer and almost exclusively use artificial containers old tires rain gutters birdbaths etc as larval habitats in the case of c pipiens the most notorious of the vector mosquitoes the dirtier the water the better they like it the important factor is that these species do not thrive in functioning wetlands where competition for resources and predation by larger aquatic and terrestrial organisms is high the remaining four species aedes vexans ochlerotatus canadensis 0 triseriatus and 0 trivittatus are currently considered potential vectors due to laboratory tests except the 0 trivittatus which did have one confirmed vector pool for west nile virus in pa during 2002 all four of these species prefer vernal habitats and ponded woodland areas following heavy summer rains these species may be the greatest threat of disease transmission around stormwater basins that pond water for more than four days this can be mitigated however by establishing ecologically functioning wetlands stormwater facilities if a stormwater wetland or pond is constructed properly and a diverse ecological community develops mosquitoes should not become a problem wet basins and wetlands constructed as stormwater management facilities should be designed to attract a diverse wildlife community if a wetland is planned proper hydrologic soil conditions and the establishment of hydrophytic vegetation will promote the population of the wetland by amphibians and other mosquito predators in natural wetlands predatory insects and amphibians are effective at keeping mosquito populations in check during the larval stage of development while birds and bats prey on adult mosquitoes the design of a stormwater wetland must include the selection of hydrophytic plant species for their pollutant uptake capabilities and for not contributing to the potential for vector mosquito breeding in particular species of emergent vegetation with little submerged growth are preferable by limiting the vegetation growing below the water surface larvae lose protective cover and there is less chance of anaerobic conditions occurring in the water stormwater ponds can be designed for multiple purposes when incorporated into an open space design a pond can serve as a stormwater management facility and a community amenity aeration fountains and stocked fish should be added to keep larval mosquito populations in check publications from the pa department of health and the penn state cooperative extension concerning west nile virus identify aggressive public education about the risks posed by standing water in artificial containers tires trash cans rain gutters bird baths as the most effective method to control vector mosquitoes 0v 109 conclusion the conservation district understands the pressure faced by municipalities when dealing with multifaceted issues such as stormwater management and encourages the incorporation of water quality management techniques into stormwater designs as monroe county continues to grow conservation design groundwater recharge and constructed wetlands and ponds should be among the preferred design options to reduce the impacts of increases in impervious surfaces when designed and constructed appropriately the runoff mitigation benefits to the community from these design options will far out weigh their potential to become breeding grounds for mosquitoes appendix g  references   bmp manuals california california stormwater bmp handbook new development and redevelopment january 2003  separate file available at

categories to assist the applicant in the preparation of site and building plans and to assist the planning commission and the zoning officer in their reviews of all site plans these guidelines are meant to encourage creativity innovation and welldesigned developments they apply to principal buildings and structures and to all accessory buildings structures signs and other site features 1 relation of proposed building to the surrounding environment relate proposed structures harmoniously to the terrain and to existing buildings that have a visual relationship to the proposed structures to achieve this favorable relationship between existing and proposed uses create focal points with respect to avenues of approach terrain features or other buildings and relate open space between all existing and proposed buildings 2 drive parking and circulation for vehicular and pedestrian circulation including walkways interior drives and parking give special attention to the location and number of access points to public streets width of interior drives and access points general interior circulation separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic arrangement of safe and convenient parking areas design these vehicular and pedestrian areas to enhance the appearance of and access to the proposed buildings and structures and to the neighboring properties 3 surface water drainage give special attention to proper site surface drainage to ensure that removal of surface waters will not adversely affect either neighboring properties or the public storm drainage system remove and efficiently carry away all stormwater from all roofs canopies and paved areas collect surface water from all paved areas to permit vehicular and pedestrian movement 4 utility service place electric and telephone lines underground where possible locate paint and undertake any other treatment to ensure that any utilities which remain aboveground will have a minimal adverse impact on neighboring properties 5 advertising features ensure that the size location lighting and materials of all permanent signs and outdoor advertising structures or xxx1i243 b15488 features will enhance rather than detract from the design of proposed buildings and structures and the neighboring properties 6 special features provide needed setbacks screen plantings and other screening methods for exposed storage areas exposed machinery installations service areas truck loading areas utility buildings and structures and similar accessory areas and structures to help make them compatible with the existing or contemplated site design and with neighboring properties 7 preservation of landscape preserve the landscape in its natural state by minimizing tree and soil removal ensure that grade changes are compatible with the general appearance of neighboring developed areas 8 solar energy use consider the desirability and feasibility of active and passive solar energy use orient proposed buildings and provide structures to provide for solar energy use and to prepare solar access of adjoining properties  of  easements no structure shall be constructed erected relocated to or placed within an

meant to encourage creativity innovation and welldesigned developments they apply to principal buildings and structures and to all accessory buildings shuctures signs and other site features 1 relation of proposed building to the surrounding environment relate proposed structures harmoniously to the terrain and to existing buildings that have a visual relationship to the proposed structures to achieve this favorable relationship between existing and proposed uses create focal points with respect to avenues of approach terrain features or other buildings and relate open space between all existing and proposed buildings 2 drive parking and circulation for vehicular and pedestrian circulation including walkways interior drives and parking give special attention to the location and number of access points to public streets width of interior drives and access points general interior circulation separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic arrangement of safe and convenient parking areas design these vehicular and pedestrian areas to enhance the appearance of and access to the proposed buildings and structures and to the neighboring properties 3 surface water drainage give special attention to proper site surface drainage to ensure that removal of surface waters will not adversely affect either neighboring properties or the public storm drainage system remove and efficiently carry away all stormwater from all roofs canopies and paved areas collect surface water from all paved areas to permit vehicular and pedestrian movement 4 utility service place electric and telephone lines underground where possible locate paint and undertake any other heatrnent to ensure that any utilities which remain aboveground will have a minimal adverse impact on neighboring properties 5 advertising features ensure that the size location lighting and materials of all permanent signs and outdoor advertising structures or xxxii312 final revised 51915 features will enhance rather than detract from the design of proposed buildings and structures and the neighboring properties 6 special features provide needed setbacks screen plantings and other screening methods for exposed storage areas exposed machinery installations service areas truck loading areas utility buildings and structures and similar accessory areas and structures to help make them compatible with the existing or contemplated site design and with neighboring properties 7 preservation of landscape preserve the landscape in its natural state by minimizing tree and soil removal ensure that grade
