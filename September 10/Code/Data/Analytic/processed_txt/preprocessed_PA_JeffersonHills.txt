parking 111998  as amended by 30200  1 1 findings and purpose the borough of jefferson hills finds that a certain residential areas in the borough of jefferson hills are subjected to commuter vehicle parking therefore depriving the residents of those areas of spaces in which to park their own vehicles  b those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the ambient air level  and c the establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for parking preference during certain hours of the day and days of the week therefore the borough considers it to be in the interest of the people of the borough to provide for the establishment of a residential permit parking program to insure primary access to available parking spaces by neighborhood residents and also to provide a cleaner ambient air level 2 definitions for the purpose of this section words and terms listed in this subsection as follows shall have the following meanings commuter vehicle  a motor vehicle parked in a residential area by a person not a resident of that

the vehicles parked or standing on the streets in the area are not registered in the name of a person residing in the area for the purpose of this criterion the latest available information from the

borough of jefferson hills allegheny county pennsylvania providing for the zoning of oil and gas drilling operations legislative findings and purpose l legislative findings a the borough council of jefferson hills finds that the proposed new provisions regarding the zoning of oil and gas operations will promote the public health safety and welfare and practical community development in the borough of jefferson hills and will provide for gas and oil drilling to take place in areas of the borough in locations which will allow extraction of gas and oil with the least detrimental impact on residentially zoned property historic or recreational resources hospitals nursing homes daycare centers and schools as such the proposed provisions will further the goals of the comprehensive plan to preserve the single family character of the borough to manage and promote future growth and to protect natural sites b information provided to the borough council and planning commission by property owners department of environmental protection and gas experts indicates that horizontal drilling techniques allow for gas to be extracted at distances of up to and in excess of seven thousand five hundred 7500 feet from the well site the regulation of well sites herein will permit reasonable access to a large percentage of the gas resources in the borough while protecting certain other uses and by regulating gas and oil well use in a manner similar to other permitted mineral removal without regulating the technical aspects of oil and gas well functioning and matters ancillary thereto c the borough council has been informed that heavy truck traffic generated by mineral removal activities can severely damage roads creating safety hazards to the travelling public and imposing great repair and reconstruction costs upon the borough therefore to protect the safety of the public and the boroughs sound fiscal operation it is necessary that advance secured arrangements for repair or replacement of such roads damaged by mineral removal generated traffic be required as a condition of approval d the boroughs experience with mineral removal activity is that extensive engineering and legal resources are consumed in the review process due to the number and complexity of land use issues to be addressed and required interaction with other regulatory agencies a higher application fee and review fee deposit is warranted e the borough council has given due public notice held the requisite hearing and duly notified the allegheny county department of economic development as it pertains to the proposed rezoning and the planning commission has made a recommendation 2 purpose it is hereby declared to be the purpose of this chapter to declare the development of oil and gas as a conditional use within newly created designated overlay zoning districts based upon the type of drilling conducted within a site the purpose of this ordinance is to provide for the health safety and welfare of the residents and their property in the borough of jefferson hills  to provide the procedure for the issuance of zoning permits to enable the exploration or production of oil or natural gas from a shale reservoir or source rock  to protect the character of the community facilitating beneficial and compatible land uses  and to further the boroughs interest in the orderly development and use of land in a manner consistent with local demographic and land use concerns jefferson hills recognizes that the regulation of oil and gas operations is the primary responsibility of the regulatory agencies of the commonwealth of pennsylvania but that the borough maintains its zoning powers as set forth in pennsylvania statute title 53 municipal planning mpc and borough of jefferson hills zoning is in the boroughs best interest to address the zoning districts where such activities will be permitted by conditional use and to have information concerning oil and gas exploration development and production taking place within the borough and to ensure certain security and safety measures related to oil and gas well drilling are in place in certain areas it is further necessary to define and classify natural gas compressor stations and natural gas processing plants as conditional uses within the 12 zoning district and establish appropriate standards to protect the public health safety and welfare from potential impacts of these uses defmltions of the borough of jefferson hills ordinances heretofore shall include the following definitions or replace the currently enacted definitions
