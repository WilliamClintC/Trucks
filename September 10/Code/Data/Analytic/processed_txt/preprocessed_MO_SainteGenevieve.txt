of two 2 inches the roof area may be considered to be pervious ground for purposes of this material aspects of ponding must be taken into account by the design architect or engineer to avoid the possibility of an overload the roof should be designed with multiple outlets and free overflows the latter providing a rapid release rate should any controlled outlet become clogged or the storage is
