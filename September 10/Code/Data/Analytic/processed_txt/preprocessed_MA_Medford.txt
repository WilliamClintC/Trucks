clerk preface the revised ordinances constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the city of medford massachusetts source materials used in the preparation of the revised ordinances were the 1974 revised ordinances as supplemented  and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council the source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof the absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the revised ordinances by use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of the revised ordinances the reader can locate any section of the revised ordinances 197 as supplemented and any subsequent ordinance included herein the chapters of the revised ordinances 197 have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage notes which tie related sections of the revised ordinances 197 together and which refer to relevant state law have been included a table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the revised ordinances 197 is included at the back of this revised ordinances 1974 system the chapter and section numbering system used in the revised ordinances is the same system used in many state and local government codes each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash the figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter thus the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 12 and the first section of chapter 6 is 61 under this system each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments for example if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 61 and 62 is desired to be added such new section would be numbered 615 new articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or in the case of articles may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject and in the case of divisions may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject the next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division new chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters page numbering system the page numbering system used in

potential hazards following the approval of this program by this department during the calendar year of 1991 initial focus will be on highhazard industries and commercial premises 6 the cross connection control coordinator strongly recommends that all new and retrofit installations of reduced pressure preventers and double check valve assemblies include the installation of strainers located immediately upstream of the backflow device the installation of strainers will preclude the fouling of backflow devices due to both foreseen and unforeseen circumstances occurring to the water supply system such as water main repairs water main breaks fires periodic cleaning and flushing of mains etc these occurrences may stir up debris within the water main that will cause fouling of backflow devices installed without the benefit of strainers b owner the owner shall be responsible for the following 1 the owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of all cross connections on his premises 2 the owner shall be responsible for applying for and obtaining all necessary approvals and permits for the maintenance of cross connections and installation of backflow

recognizes the threat to the public water system arising from cross connections as such the director of public works whereas he is responsible for the quality of the public water supply may require a containment device on the water service entrance to any customer who as a result of unprotected cross connections could contaminate the public water supply system 7 841992 existing inuse backflow prevention devices any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the director of public works to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health where the degree of hazard has increased as in the case of a residential installation converting to a business establishment any existing backflow preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure backflow preventer or a reduced pressure backflow preventer must be installed in the event that no backflow device was present 8 841992 periodic testing a reduced pressure backflow preventers and double check valve assemblies shall be tested and inspected at least semiannually by the director of public works or his delegated agent b periodic testing shall be performed by the director of public works certified tester or his delegated representative c the testing shall be conducted during the director of public works regular business hours exceptions to this when at the request of the owner may require additional charges to cover the increased costs to the director of public works or his delegated agent d reduced pressure backflow preventers and double check valve assemblies must be tested annually by the owner independent of the semiannual tests by the water supplier and such test must be conducted by a certified tester e any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test must be repaired or replaced by a licensed plumber when repairs are necessary upon completion of the repair the device will be retested at the owners expense to ensure proper operation highhazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately in other situations a date of not more than 14 days after the test date will be established parallel installation of two devices is an effective means of the owner insuring that uninterrupted water service remains during testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such continuity f backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than specified previously in subsection a of this section in cases where there is a history of test failures and the director of public works feels that due to the degree of hazard involved additional testing is warranted costs of the additional tests will be borne by the owner  841992 enforcement of division a the director of public works shall not allow a cross connection to exist with the public water supply system unless it is considered necessary and all appropriate approvals and permits have been issued b after any violations of this division are found in surveys or otherwise the supplier must send out a cross connection violation form detailing the violations and a procedure for corrective action this shall include a requirement for plan submittal and will include the deadline for such submittal and who the reviewing authority will be either the department the director of public works or his designee a period of 30 days will be granted for plan submittal unless a more appropriate schedule is necessary in the judgment of the director of public works c if the owner of any premises does not initiate corrective actions by the prescribed deadline the director of public works will then issue a followup letter indicating that the owner remains in violation and under 310 cmr 2222 section 2b of the drinking water regulations of the commonwealth of massachusetts will have his service terminated unless corrective work is initiated within 15 days d if the owner of any premises remains in noncompliance after the deadline established in this second letter the property will be posted for shutoff and the water service will be terminated the owner will be notified of this in writing e if circumstances arise where a large number of violations are found and it becomes a large financial burden to the owner of the premises then a creative enforcement strategy will be undertaken whereby corrective work is staggered over a reasonable period of time however the public water supply distribution mains must never be at risk and containment devices will be a priority at any highhazard facility f if the occasion should arise where termination of the water supply will result in unreasonable risk to the public health of the community then the department will be notified and other enforcement strategies will be necessary including but not limited to the assessment of an administrative penalty to any owner in noncompliance with section 22 of the drinking water regulations of the commonwealth of massachusetts  841992 records and reports a records the director of

significant individual andor cumulative effect upon the resource area values protected by this article the commission within 21 days of the close of the hearing shall issue or deny a permit for the activities requested if it issues a permit the commission shall impose conditions that it deems necessary or desirable to protect those values and all activities shall be done in accordance with those conditions the commission shall take into account the cumulative adverse effects of loss degradation isolation and replication of protected resource areas throughout the community and the watershed resulting from past activities permitted and exempt and foreseeable future activities where no conditions are adequate to protect those resource values the commission is empowered to deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements of this article it may also deny a permit for failure to submit necessary information and plans requested by the commission  for failure to meet the design specifications performance standards and other requirements in regulations of the commission  or for failure to avoid or prevent unacceptable significant individual andor cumulative effects upon the resource area values protected by this article lands within 200 feet of rivers and lands within 100 feet of other resource areas are presumed important to the protection of these resources because activities undertaken in close proximity to resource areas have a high likelihood of adverse impact upon the wetland or other resource either immediately as a consequence of construction clearing or over time as a consequence of daily operation or existence of the activities these adverse impacts from construction and use can include without limitation erosion siltation loss of groundwater recharge poor water quality excessive nitrogen andor phosphorous loading and loss of wildlife habitat the commission may therefore establish performance standards for protection of the adjacent upland resource area including without limitation strips of continuous undisturbed vegetative cover within the adjacent upland resource area or other form of work limit or setback to buildings roads landscaping and other features unless the applicant convinces the commission that the area or part of it may be disturbed without harm to the values protected by this article the specific size and type of protected area may be established by regulations of the commission in the review of areas within 200 feet of rivers no permit issued hereunder shall allow any activities unless the applicant in addition to meeting the otherwise applicable requirements of this article has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that 1 there is no practicable alternative to the proposed project with less adverse effects and that 2 such activities including proposed mitigation measures will have no significant adverse impact on the areas or values protected by this article the commission shall regard as practicable an alternative which is reasonably available and capable of being done after taking into consideration the proposed property use overall project purpose eg residential institutional commercial or industrial purpose logistics existing technology costs of the alternatives and overall project costs to prevent wetlands loss the commission shall require applicants to avoid wetlands alteration wherever feasible  shall minimize wetlands alteration  and where alteration is unavoidable shall require full mitigation the commission may authorize or require replication of wetlands as a form of mitigation but only with adequate security professional design and monitoring to assure success because of the high likelihood of failure of replication the commission may require a wildlife habitat study of the project area to be paid for by the applicant whenever it deems appropriate regardless of the type of resource area or the amount or type of alteration proposed the decision shall be based upon the commissions estimation of the importance of the habitat area considering but not limited to such factors as proximity to other areas suitable for wildlife importance of wildlife corridors in the area or possible presence of rare species in the area the work shall be performed by an individual who is approved by the conservation commission and at a minimum meets the qualifications set out in the wildlife habitat section of the wetlands protection act regulations 310 cmr 1060 the commission shall presume that all areas meeting the criteria of vernal pools of this article as defined in the definitions including its adjacent upland resource area perform essential habitat functions this presumption may be overcome only by the presentation of credible evidence which in the judgment of the commission demonstrates that the basin or depression does not provide essential habitat functions any formal evaluation should be performed by an individual meeting the qualifications under the wildlife habitat section of the wetlands protection act regulations 310 cmr 1060 a permit shall expire three years from the date of issuance the commission reserves the right to require a conservation restriction on any property or portion thereof that the commission deems appropriate to the interests protected under the wetlands protection act mgla c 131  40 and this article in carrying out its duties under this article the commission shall take into account the ongoing damage to and impairment of property values resulting from the enclosure of natural watercourses in pipes and culverts that has already occurred in various locations throughout the city the loss of flood storage area associated with those projects and the extent to which increased urbanization has increased flows to the citys existing stormwater infrastructure the commission may require replication of flood storage capacity on a greater than onetoone basis reduction of peak flows or other mitigation where feasible notwithstanding the above the commission in its discretion may issue a permit expiring five years from the date of issuance for recurring or continuous maintenance andor restoration work provided that annual notification of time and location of work is given to the commission any permit may be renewed once for an additional oneyear period provided that a request for a renewal is received in writing by the commission 30 days prior to expiration notwithstanding the above a permit may identify conditions which shall be enforceable for a stated number of years indefinitely or until permanent protection is in place and shall apply to all owners of the land for good cause the commission may revoke any permit other order determination or other decision issued under this article after notice to the holder of the permit the public abutters and city boards and a public hearing amendments to permits or determinations shall be handled in the manner set out in the wetlands protection act mgla c 131  40 and this article the commission in an appropriate case may combine the decision issued under this article with the order of conditions

proposed in any application shall be undertaken until the permit orad or determination issued by the commission with respect to such work has been recorded in the registry of deeds or if the land affected is registered land in the registry section of the land court for the district wherein the land lies and until the holder of the permit certifies in writing to the commission that the document has been recorded if the applicant fails to perform the commission may record the documents itself if at any time after a determination of applicability or order of conditions has been issued there is a change in the proposed activity the person on whose behalf the work is being done in the case of a determination or the applicant in the case of an order must notify the commission in writing or in person of the proposed changes no work associated with these changes shall be done on the subject area until the commission has reviewed the changes and issued its decision the commission shall review these changes and determine either 1 that the changes represent a substantial departure from the original proposal and that the potential impacts of the new proposal on the interests identified in this article are sufficiently different from those of the original proposal as to require the filing of a new request for determination or notice of intent  2 that the changes involve a substantial departure from the original proposal in only one or two limited respects and that the commission will consider amending the original determination or order following submission of information on the proposed changes and their potential impacts on the interests identified in this article and following a public meeting or hearing and notice as required in this article  or 3 that the changes represent an insignificant change in the original proposal and will cause no significant difference in the impact of the activity on the interests identified in this article in which case the person proposing these changes may proceed in conformance with them the person making this request shall be notified by the commission of its decision within 21 days of receipt of his request the commission shall after receiving a written request for a certificate of compliance inspect the resource area where any activity governed by a permit issued under this article was carried out and if such activity has been completed in accordance with said permit the commission shall within 21 days after such request issue a certificate of compliance evidencing such determination which may in an appropriate

or lots a lot on which such an increase occurs being referred to as a benefited lot and correspondingly decreased on another lot or lots a lot on which such a decrease occurs being referred to as a burdened lot as follows 1 the far on a benefited lot shall be increased as follows the then permitted far on the benefited lot ie 225 as the same may have been previously increased or decreased by operation of this section 94214 shall be multiplied by the lot area of the benefited lot  to that product there shall be added the number of square feet of gfa transferred from the burdened lot or lots and the resulting sum shall be divided by the lot area of the benefited lot to yield the thenpermitted far for the benefited lot 2 the far on a burdened lot shall be reduced as follows the thenpermitted far on the burdened lot ie 225 as the same may have been previously increased or decreased by operation of this section 94214 shall be multiplied by the lot area of the burdened lot  from that product there shall be subtracted the number of square feet of gfa transferred to the benefited lot or lots and the resulting sum shall be divided by the lot area of the burdened lot to yield the thenpermitted far for the burdened lot by way of example if in an muz district lot a contained a lot area of 80000 square feet and lot b contained a lot area of 100000 square feet and neither the far base nor the far maximum has been increased by special permit without any transfer of gfa or far under this section the maximum gfa on lot a would be 180000 sf 80000  225 and the maximum gfa on lot b would be 225000 sf 100000  225 the far on lot a could be increased and the far on lot a could be decreased by the transfer from lot b to lot a of 10000 sf of gfa in that event the far of lot a would be increased to  and the far of lot b would be decreased to 215 determined as set forth in 1 and 2 above as follows lot a 225 thenpermitted far times 80000 lot area of lot a   180000 plus 10000 gfa transferred   190000  divided by 80000 lot area of lot a    lot b 225 thenpermitted far times 100000 lot area of lot b 225000  minus 10000 gfa transferred   215000 divided by 100000 lot area of lot b   215 under the foregoing example because the resulting far on lot a would not exceed 110 percent of the 225 far ie 2475 such a transfer is allowed no building permit shall be issued for a building which would result in an far in excess of the far base on a benefited lot unless i the record owner of the burdened lot or lots has executed and recorded at the middlesex south registry of deeds or the middlesex south registry district of the land court as the case may be an agreement running with his land and binding on his successors and assigns agreeing to a decrease in his gfa and far pursuant to the terms of the immediately preceding paragraphs and ii the building inspector has been supplied with copies of such evidence as he deems reasonably necessary to satisfy himself that the person executing such agreement is the true record owner of the burdened lot and that such agreement has been duly recorded or registered 10a4 221988   632003 setbacks in an muz
