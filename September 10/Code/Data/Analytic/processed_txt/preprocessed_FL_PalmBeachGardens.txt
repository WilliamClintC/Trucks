capacity of new facilities operating at their adopted level of service that will become available on or before the date of occupancy of the development the capacity of new facilities may be counted only if one or more of the following is shown 1 construction of the new facilities is underway at the time of issuance of the development order 2 the funds for construction of new facilities are included in the first three years of the adopted county fiveyear road program or the adopted fiveyear state department of transportation improvement program or the city fiveyear capital improvements element  3 the new facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for providing the facilities at the time of issuance of the development order 4 the new facilities are guaranteed in a legally enforceable developer agreement pursuant but not limited to fs or the developer agreement must guarantee that the necessary facilities will be in place when the impacts of the development occur 2 capacity availability the determination of available capacity is made by subtracting from the sum of subsections c1a and c1b of this section from the sum of a the demand for the facility created by existing development  and b the demand for the facility that has been reserved for other proposed developments by the issuance of a valid concurrency certificate  72000 action upon failure
