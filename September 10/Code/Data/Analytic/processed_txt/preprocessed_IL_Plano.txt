adopted to meet the national flood insurance program regulations but is not intended to repeal the resolution which the city passed in order to establish initial eligibility for the program  erosion and sedimentation control 661 purpose the city hereby finds as follows a that excessive quantities of soil are eroding from areas that are undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses including but not limited to the construction of dwelling units commercial buildings and industrial plants the building of roads and highways and the creation of recreational facilities  b that the washing blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles  c that said soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies washed out fills and embankments  d that the sediment from said soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt the rivers streams lakes and reservoirs  e that said sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes destroying fish and other aquatic life and that said sediment is costly and difficult to remove  and f that said sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways resulting in greatly increased chances of flooding at grave danger to public health and safety the city therefore declares that the purpose of these requirements is to provide minimum standards to safeguard persons and to protect property and prevent the despoliation of the environment and to promote the public welfare by regulating and controlling the design construction quality of  sterling codifiers inc  254403 materials and use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on land situated in the city  662 general control standards the following general principles shall apply to any movement of

illinois municipal code the purpose of this chapter is to diminish threats to public health safety and welfare caused by excess stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment this chapter seeks to establish stormwater management practices and promote sustainable planning and design to counter increases in stormwater runoff quantity and rate and the impairment of water quality from development and land improvement b objectives this chapter is adopted to accomplish the following objectives 1 to assure that new development does not increase the drainage or flood hazards to others or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion 2 to protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage due to increased stormwater runoff 3 to protect human life and health from the hazards of increased flooding 4 to lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects repairs to flood damaged public facilities and utilities correction of channel erosion problems and flood rescue and relief operations caused by increased stormwater runoff quantities from new development 5 to protect conserve and promote the orderly development of land and water resources 6 to preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of watercourses and floodplains and to protect water quality and aquatic habitats 7 to preserve the natural characteristics of the land in order to moderate flood and storm water impacts improve water quality reduce soil erosion protect aquatic and riparian habitat provide recreational opportunities provide aesthetic benefits
