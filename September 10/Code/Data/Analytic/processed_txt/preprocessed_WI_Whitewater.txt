codification the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of book publishing company under the direction of mr clark dempsey city attorney the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the

organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials city employees and private citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by number section if

c factors to be considered the alrc in making its recommendation and the council in making its decision shall consider the following factors 1 factors to be considered for reviewing new license applications a economic development considerations the council finds that while all of the factors listed below are important considerations in licensing issuance decisions economic development consideration should be a primary factor in the decision in considering the economic development impact of an application the alrc and the council will favor license applications that support important additional desirable development such as businesses that provide high quality employment opportunities businesses that provide attractive entertainment opportunities or establishments that feature high quality restaurants the council also finds that establishments whose primary purpose is to serve alcohol and that do not support other important additional developments should be given low priority in the application process because the city has an excess supply of similar establishments and those establishments do not foster economic development also such businesses tend to cause more police enforcement related problems and often detract from the immediate neighborhood and at times diminish the quality of life in the city of whitewater the council also finds that it is appropriate and in the publics best interest to at times hold in reserve one or more licenses that are limited by quota so that there will be a license or licenses available if a highly desirable development that needs a license seeks to locate in the city of whitewater b character of applicant agent managerial personnel and owners c experience of applicant and manager in operating a licensed establishment d history of applicant and manager in operation of licensed establishments e history of premises f design type and size of the proposed establishment g proximity to other licensed establishments h proximity to residential buildings or areas i ability of police department to ensure public safety at this location j condition of buildingpremises k compatibility of proposed use with the surrounding neighborhood l zoning and land use considerations m likely impact on property values n any other relevant considerations d ranking applications when deciding between applications those applications which best meet the listed factors shall be judged as superior to other applications if there are multiple applications pending for licenses whether the licenses are available or not the timing of the filing of the application shall not create any preference if more than one license application is pending for any particular license the alcohol licensing committee shall recommend which application if any in order of priority should be granted  4212009   4202010   nonalcohol eventsunderaged persons the presence of underage persons on a licensed premises as provided under 3a10 wis stats shall be subject to the following 1 the licensee or agent of a corporate licensee shall notify the police department at least seventytwo hours in advance of any date on which underage persons will be present on the licensed premises each such nonalcohol event notice shall specify the dates on which the event is to occur and the times of commencement all notices shall be

may not last more than twentyfour hours        cancellation a findings of fact and purpose the common council finds that the nonuse of alcohol licenses that are available in limited numbers is generally contrary to the publics best interest this is because alcohol licenses if used responsibly can attract and retain businesses such as restaurants and hotels and thereby create jobs and provide nonalcoholrelated entertainment and service opportunities for the general public furthermore the nonuse of alcohol licenses limited by quotas is unfair to persons or businesses that seek to earn income use of a license but are unable to receive a license because of the limited number available to be issued by the city b cancellation for nonuse any class a or class b license granted under this chapter may be cancelled by the common council 1 if it is not used within sixty days after its initial issuance this sixtyday nonuse provision applies only to initial license issuance and does not apply to license renewals  2 if its usage is discontinued for a period of ninety consecutive days or more  3 if the holder does not use the license for at least fifty days during the oneyear

time to alter repair remodel or redecorate the premises  3 certain factors of death illness or contractual impossibility  4 any other unusual circumstances not under the control of the license grantee or holder e investigations and inspections to determine compliance with this section may be conducted by the city of whitewater police department or any city employee or official directed by the city manager to conduct an investigation or inspection to determine compliance if a licensee is found to be in violation of the terms of this section future inspections shall subject the licensee to the

licensed premises with an open container containing any alcohol beverage part 1984   maximum number of licenses a the common council finds that limiting the number of alcohol licenses in one building

maximum number of class a and class b licenses issued to premises in any single building shall be limited to two also no building shall be allowed to have more than one class a or more than one class

postconstruction runoff authority this chapter is adopted by the city of whitewater under the authority granted by wis stats this chapter supersedes all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted under wis stats that relate to stormwater management regulations except as otherwise specified in wis stats wis stats applies to this chapter and to any amendments to this chapter the provisions of this chapter are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the same governing body the city of whitewater hereby designates the director of public works to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter the requirements of this chapter to not preempt more stringent stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following a wisconsin department of natural resources administrative rules permits or approvals including those authorized under 33 wis stats b targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the wisconsin department of natural resources under wis adm    findings of fact the city of whitewater finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can a degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature  b diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants  c alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads  d reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading  e threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities  f threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes  g undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding    purpose and intent a purpose the general purpose of this chapter is to establish longterm postconstruction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health safety welfare and the aquatic environment specific purposes are to 1 further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions  2 prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater prevent and control soil erosion  prevent and control water pollution  protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  control building sites placement of structures and land uses  preserve ground cover and scenic beauty  and promote sound economic growth  3 control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies  prevent undue channel erosion  control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property b intent it is the intent of the city of whitewater that this chapter regulates postconstruction stormwater discharges to waters of the state this chapter may be applied on a sitebysite basis the city of whitewater recognizes however that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this chapter is preparation and implementation of comprehensive systemslevel stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units such as watersheds on a municipal and regional scale such plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices practices or systems any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under wis stats for regional stormwater management measures and have been approved by the city of whitewater it is the intent of this chapter that the approved plan be used to identify postconstruction management measures acceptable for the community    applicability and jurisdiction a applicability 1 where not otherwise limited by law this chapter applies to land development activity that results in twenty thousand square feet or more of land disturbing construction activity or results in a net increase of ten thousand square feet or more of impervious surface including areas that are part of a larger

interest served by furthering the implementation of the purposes of this chapter and the city comprehensive plan in terms of limiting the further spread of strip commercial development of which advertising signs are a primary contributor furthermore the city advocates this regulation leaves ample and adequate alternative channels of commercial speech communication for the messages

ordinance from which this chapter is derived or an amendment thereto that does not conform to the current use restrictions of this title 4 nonconforming structure means a dwelling building or other structure that existed lawfully at the time of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or an amendment thereto that does not conform to one or more of the development regulations of this title any such structure conforming with respect to use containing a conforming use but not in respect to development regulations shall be considered a nonconforming structure and not a nonconforming use figure no 1 is it fifty percent yet sample problem lets assume that the owner of a house with a nonconforming use ie nonconforming institutional use in a residential zoned home wishes to add a room to the house if the house had an equalized assessed value of one hundred thousand dollars in 199 the property owner would be able to make improvements valued at up to fifty percent of the present 1997 equalized assessed value of the house or fifty thousand dollars at that time the improvement would have to be built to zoning standards any further additions or structural alterations could not be allowed unless the use of the structure is permanently changed to a conforming use additions and modifications are based upon a given time over the life of a structure if in the example above the property owner constructed a fifty thousand dollars addition in 199 no further additions could be allowed because the fifty percent improvement limit had been reached however lets assume that the addition was valued at twenty thousand dollars or twenty percent of the 1997 equalized assessed value of the structure one hundred thousand dollars ten years later the property owner again comes in wishing to add an attached storage room in the meantime the equalized assessed value of the house has increased from one hundred thousand dollars in 1997 to one hundred fifty thousand dollars in 2007 the value of the storage room is fifteen thousand dollars in 2007 the property owner has now accumulated modifications totaling thirty percent of the equalized assessed values from 1997 and 2007 finally ten years later when the equalized assessed value of the house is two hundred thousand dollars the property owner again comes in wishing to modify his house to the extent of forty thousand dollars the cumulative percentage of the modifications totals fifty percent based on the cumulative percentage of each modification in relation to the equalized assessed value of the house in the year the modification was made this example is further clarified in the following table notethe base for calculation is not the original value of the house at the time the zoning ordinance was enacted but is the equalized assessed value of the house at each time the house is modified year equalized assessed value of home value of modification modification as a percentage of assessed value cumulative percentage 1997 $100000 $20000 20 20 2007 $150000 $15000 10 30 2017 $200000 $40000 20 50 definition equalized assessed value is the value of a structure andor lot of property
