matters of legitimate substantial and compelling governmental interests 1 to protect juveniles and adults from illegal drug activity including use sale and drug abuse such as overdoses and to reduce if not eliminate such activity from occurring in dance halls  2 to protect juveniles and adults from violent criminal activity occurring in dance halls  3 to protect juveniles and adult victims from

purpose and intent of this article to preserve public safety human life and convenience  to secure the comfort health welfare and prosperity of all city inhabitants  to ensure that the use of streets in the city does not become dangerous and that the free flow of traffic thereon is not impeded  to preserve privacy and quiet to those in the home  to protect city inhabitants against crime and undue annoyance  and to protect those on the streets and at home against abusive behavior by peddlers and canvassers it is also the purpose and intent of this article to address the significant public health welfare and safety concerns and crowd control problems caused by peddling and canvassing on or near public streets which are in use by vehicular traffic the city commission finds that such public health welfare and safety concerns and crowd control problems arise because peddling involves the process of a peddler offering for sale goods merchandise or wares to an occupant or operator of a vehicle which is in traffic that vehicle occupant or operator must consider the offer and if the vehicle occupant or operator decides to purchase the goods merchandise or wares that person must reach for a wallet search for money or write a check all while the peddler and vehicle are located on a public street in use by vehicular traffic based on the foregoing the city commission finds that the activity of peddling from occupants or operators of vehicles located on streets in use by vehicular traffic distracts drivers from their primary duty to watch traffic and potential hazards in the road observe all traffic signals or warnings and move citys streets and intersections in a lawful and safe manner and creates a potential safety hazard and poses a substantial risk to the public and impedes the free flow of traffic on the streets within the city resulting in the delay and obstruction of the publics free flow of travel on the citys streets the city commission further finds that the safety of peddlers canvassers pedestrians and operators or occupants of vehicles is at significant risk when peddlers or canvassers engage in their activities on or near public streets which are in use by vehicular traffic because the nature of these activities often entails peddlers and canvassers standing on traffic medians bicycle paths and public streets in use by vehicular traffic property only meant for the use and control of vehicular traffic and not peddling or canvassing activities it is not the purpose and intent of this article to prohibit peddling and canvassing in public areas when such activities will not interfere with vehicular traffic and cause traffic safety and traffic flow concerns for example peddlers may conduct their activities on public sidewalks so long as they are not conducting transactions with operators or occupants of vehicles in traffic and are otherwise in compliance with this addition canvassers may engage in their activities on public sidewalks so long as they are otherwise in compliance with this  121100   72307 definitions for the purposes of this chapter the following words shall have the meanings ascribed to them as follows

begging panhandling and soliciting footnotes  3  cross reference offenses ch 17 legislative findings the city commission recognizes a constitutional right to beg panhandle or solicit in a peaceful and nonthreatening manner the city commission finds however that an increase in aggressive begging panhandling or soliciting throughout the city has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses and has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places but also to an enhanced sense of fear intimidation and disorder the experience of the city shows that a greater majority of the beggars panhandlers or solicitors arrested in the year 2003 had a narcotics or assault violation in their criminal history that causes the city commission to regulate this activity to protect the citizenry in the interest of public safety aggressive begging panhandling or soliciting usually includes approaching or following pedestrians repetitive begging panhandling or soliciting despite refusals the use of abusive or profane language unwanted physical contact or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic the city commission further finds that the presence of persons who solicit money from other persons at or near outdoor cafes automated teller machines the entrance and exits of buildings certain public events as more particularly described in this article and payphones is especially troublesome because said persons cannot readily escape from the undesired conduct such activity often carries with it an implicit threat to both persons and property the experience of the city shows that a majority of the beggars panhandlers or solicitors arrested in the year 2003 were apprehended in and around automated teller machines parking lots parking garages restaurants and business entrances the city commission also finds that people driving or parking on city streets frequently find themselves faced with beggars panhandlers or solicitors seeking money by offering to perform services such as opening car doors or locating parking spaces the city commission further finds that the activity of begging panhandling or soliciting presents significant public health welfare and safety concerns and crowd control problems when such activities are conducted on or near public streets which are in use by vehicular traffic because these activities involve the process of a person requesting a donation from an occupant or operator of a vehicle which is in traffic that vehicle occupant or operator must consider the request and if the vehicle occupant or operator decides to fulfill the request that person must reach for a wallet search for money or write a check all while that person and vehicle are located on a public street in use by vehicular traffic based on the foregoing the city commission finds that the activity of begging panhandling or soliciting from occupants or operators of vehicles located on streets in use by vehicular traffic distracts drivers from their primary duty to watch traffic and potential hazards in the road observe all traffic signals or warnings and move citys streets and intersections in a lawful and safe manner and creates a potential safety hazard and poses a substantial risk to the public and impedes the free flow of traffic on the streets within the city resulting in the delay and obstruction of the publics free flow of travel on the citys streets the city commission further finds that the safety of beggars panhandlers solicitors pedestrians and operators and occupants of vehicles is at significant risk when such activities occur because the nature of these activities often entails beggars panhandlers or solicitors standing on traffic medians bicycle paths and public streets in use by vehicular traffic property only meant for the use and control of vehicular traffic and not begging panhandling or soliciting it is not the purpose and intent of this article to prohibit begging panhandling or soliciting in public areas when such activities will not interfere with vehicular traffic and cause traffic safety and traffic flow concerns or when such activities will not otherwise cause any public health welfare and safety concerns for example beggars panhandlers or solicitors may conduct their activities on public sidewalks so long as they are not conducting transactions with operators or occupants of vehicles in traffic and are otherwise in compliance with this law is timely and appropriate because current city ordinances are insufficient to address the aforementioned problems the restrictions contained herein are neither overbroad nor vague and are narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest moreover this article only restricts begging panhandling and soliciting in certain public places while preserving ample alternative areas for the valid exercise of first amendment constitutional rights furthermore in enacting this article the city commission recognizes the availability of community service and other sentencing alternatives which may be appropriate remedies for violations of this article the law is not intended to limit any persons from exercising their constitutional right to beg panhandle or solicit funds picket protest or engage in other constitutionally protected activity its goal is instead to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of begging panhandling or solicitation that have become an unwelcome and overwhelming presence in the city and to prohibit aggressive begging panhandling and solicitation and begging panhandling and solicitation in certain public places based upon significant governmental interests  31504   72307 begging panhandling or soliciting on public property sidewalks and streets  certain designated places prohibited a purpose the city commission finds that any person who begs panhandles or solicits under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity by unwanted touching detaining impeding or intimidation which causes fear or apprehension in another person constitutes a threat to the public health welfare and safety of the citizenry the city commission also finds that any person who intentionally blocks the passage of another person or a vehicle which requires another person to take evasive action to avoid physical contact constitutes a threat to the public health welfare and safety of the citizenry the city commission further finds that any person who begs panhandles or solicits under circumstances where the person being solicited cannot readily escape from the undesired conduct constitutes a threat to the public health welfare and safety of the citizenry the city commission also finds that any person begging panhandling or soliciting from occupants or operators of vehicles while such vehicles are on the portion of a public street currently in use by vehicular traffic and any person begging panhandling or soliciting on traffic medians bicycle paths or publics streets when such property is in use by vehicular traffic poses a threat to public safety and prevents the free flow of traffic on public streets b definitions except where the content otherwise requires as used in this chapter 1

establish development standards that will encourage a more efficient and sustainable urban form by allowing a range of housing employment shopping and recreation choices and opportunities in a compact pedestrianfriendly environment b transects a transect is a geographical crosssection of a region that reveals a sequence of environments that ranges from rural to urban using the transect to regulate development ensures that a community offers a full diversity of development types and that each has appropriate characteristics for its location there are typically six transects organizing the components of placemaking natural zone rural zone urban neighborhood zone general urban zone urban center zone and urban core this code assigns transects that are tailored to the unique character of the city of gainesville the allowable uses dimensional standards and development requirements for these zones are described within this division zone description intended site layout urban zone 1 consists of predominantly low to medium density residential areas adjacent to higher intensity zones where neighborhood services and mixed use are permitted buildings typically occupy the center of the lot with setbacks on all sides the front yard is intended to be visually continuous with the yards of adjacent buildings urban zones 2  5 consists of a wide range of residential building types higher number zones provide for the integration of offices and neighborhood services within an increasingly urban fabric setbacks and landscaping are variable streets with curbs and sidewalks define mediumsized blocks buildings typically occupy one side of the lot leaving a setback to the other side to allow for access or privacy in many instances the building occupies the entire lot frontage a shallow frontage setback defines a more urban condition urban zones 6  9 consists of higher density mixed use buildings that accommodate retail offices and apartments it has a tight network of streets with wide sidewalks steady street tree planting and buildings set close to the sidewalks the building typically occupies the full frontage leaving the rear of the lot as the sole yard the continuous facade steadily defines the public street in its residential form this type is the attached dwelling the rear yard can accommodate substantial parking downtown consists of the highest density and height development with the greatest variety of uses and civic buildings of regional importance streets have steady street tree planting and buildings are set close to wide sidewalks the building occupies the boundaries of its lot while internally defining one or more private patios this is the most urban of types as it is able to shield the private realm from all sides while strongly defining the public street c streets within the transects new developments shall connect to the existing street network where the existing street network is deficient with respect to gridded connectivity the development shall provide new street connections to meet the block perimeter requirements the zoning map identifies a hierarchy of street types that determine the relationship of buildings to the street and the standards for the design of street landscaping and sidewalks street types include storefront principal thoroughfare and local streets all undesignated existing streets are assumed to be local streets below is a detailed description of the general function character and elements of each street type final street design for new development shall be in accordance with this article and the design manual subject to review and approval by the city manager or designee in the development review process in the event of a conflict between the standards in this article and the design manual the design manual shall govern a storefront storefront streets are designed to encourage a high level of pedestrian activity higher intensity and density uses front this street type due to the level of pedestrian activity on this street type minimum sidewalk widths are increased and first floor residential development requires a one and onehalf foot elevation above grade three feet recommended for the privacy and comfort of residents building front entrances shall be oriented to this street type when there are multiple street frontages for the property b principal principal streets include lower levels of pedestrian activity compared to storefront streets this street type is located in mixeduse areas where the traffic volume is anticipated to be higher than on local streets this street type allows for some autooriented uses with a special use permit c thoroughfares thoroughfares are streets that carry high volumes of at higher speeds with less pedestrian activity and higher vehicular speeds than other street types these streets are often fronted by larger scale commercial development and are usually fourlane or sixlane streets d local local streets are intended to have slow speeds and provide for connections within neighborhoods and between residential areas and commercial areas local streets are not identified on the zoning map but make up the vast majority of the street types within the transects any street that is not identified as a storefront principal or thoroughfare street should be assumed to be a local street e urban walkways urban walkways are pedestrianbicycle pathways that serve to improve pedestrianbicycle connectivity delineate blocks and provide for expanded pedestrian space these may be established as alternatives to new streets in some locations f alleys alleys are narrower streets that are primarily used for service access to developments or vehicular access to rear parking areas alleys are encouraged to be preserved improved or established in conjunction with development  3 4518   permitted uses the following table contains the list of uses allowed and specifies whether the uses are allowed by right p

businesses that may locate in the city in the future the city finds that the cases and secondary effects documentation relied on in this section are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects c spacing a sexually oriented business may not be established in any permitted district unless all other requirements of the chapter pertaining to such districts and to buildings

condition division 3  natural and archaeological resources   generally a purpose and intent natural and archaeological resources within and around the city of gainesville provide environmental and social benefits and functions such as water quality improvement flood storage and attenuation erosion control biological diversity and groundwater recharge along with recreational aesthetic and educational opportunities for people it is the purpose and intent of this section to 1 protect conserve and restore natural and archaeological resources and their environmental functions which are of aesthetic ecological economic educational historical recreational or scientific value to the city and its citizens  2 preserve the ecological values and functions of significant natural communities in order to maintain and enhance the diversity and distribution of native plant and animal species especially for species listed for protection by state and federal agencies  3 conserve enhance and manage the ecological integrity of natural systems that have aesthetic ecological economic educational historical recreational or scientific value due to the interrelationships within the ecosystem and its natural communities and among the populations of species within the communities  4 promote connectivity and minimize fragmentation of natural systems and to protect wetlands floodplains and associated uplands in a broad systems context based planning across multiple parcels rather than by individual parcel  5 provide a greater degree of protection for strategic ecosystem resource areas in recognition that the larger resource areas within strategic ecosystems provide the broadest range of benefits functions and values listed above  6 provide protection for floridan aquifer high recharge areas and for archaeological and geological resources which are significant due to the interrelationships of natural or cultural resource values characteristics or due to unique hazards or vulnerabilities posed by developed land uses  7 avoid loss or degradation of such benefits and functions to minimize unavoidable degradation or loss of benefits and functions and to require sustainable mitigation that fully offsets any unavoidable loss or degradation of such benefits and functions  and 8 ensure that development activities that cause the unavoidable degradation or loss of

follows the city shall work with the applicant to select that portion of the significant natural community or communities that will be included in the setaside area based on the limitations and factors identified in this the fnai guide the applicant may relocate existing vegetation to another portion of the site or establish a new area of native plants on another portion of the site as part of an approved management plan 2 alternatives to onsite protection alternatives to onsite protection of significant natural communities may be considered in the following circumstances a when physical constraints of the parcel preclude maintenance of ecological integrity of preserved vegetation given considerations as to size of the development site habitat quality connectivity adjacent uses and feasibility of management  b when opportunities exist for longterm protection and management of significant natural communities of equal or greater habitat value than would have otherwise been
