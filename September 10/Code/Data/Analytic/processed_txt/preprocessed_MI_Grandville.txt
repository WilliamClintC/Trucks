of or otherwise adversely affect the following reserved rights 1 right to require franchise of the 1963 michigan constitution and the city charter require that all public utilities obtain a franchise to conduct a local business within the city the applicability of this requirement to telecommunications providers may be challenged under dd of the michigan telecommunications act which purports to define telecommunications services as not constituting public utility services due to this and other legal and regulatory issues and to avoid the expense and delay of litigation that may be unnecessary the city hereby determines that telecommunications providers shall not be required at this time to obtain franchises for the transaction of local business within the city telecommunications providers shall be required to obtain and maintain a permit for access to and ongoing use of the public rightsofway and to otherwise comply with the terms of this chapter such a permit shall not constitute a franchise the city reserves the right to require telecommunications providers to obtain a franchise in the future to transact local business within the city 2 rights regarding takings claim certain cable or telecommunications providers have initiated or supported legal proceedings in which they contend that federal law grants them the right to physically occupy the rightsofway and other property of a municipality for the purpose of providing telecommunications service without compensating the municipality for the use or value of the property so occupied or the cost of acquiring and maintaining such property municipalities dispute that claim the city believes that if such a claim were sustained it would among other things constitute an unlawful taking by the united states in violation of the fifth amendment of the united states constitution the legal issues involved in such disputes have not been finally decided the city desires to act on applications for permits granting access to its public rightsofway at this time rather than wait for determination of these issues provided this can be done without waiver or loss of any rights of the city or a permittee therefore notwithstanding any other provision hereof a permittee is not precluded by this chapter from seeking relief from the fee provisions of section 24510 from any court or agency of competent jurisdiction if a permittee seeks such relief the city reserves the right to assert a takings claim and to take all action it deems necessary is support thereof neither this chapter nor the issuance or acceptance of a permit hereunder constitutes or will be claimed to constitute a waiver or relinquishment of any rights or defenses of either the city or the permittee in connection with these disputed issues and the acceptance of a permit constitutes an acknowledgment and agreement thereto by the permittee 3 option to obtain consent agreement the city finds that legislative legal and regulatory issues in connection with use of the public rightsofway by telecommunications providers and the resulting potential for litigation and delay are likely to have an adverse impact on the development of a healthy competitive telecommunications infrastructure in the community this would be detrimental to the city and its residents as well as to telecommunications providers the issues affect among other things both the cost to telecommunications providers and compensation to the city for the maintenance and use of its public rightsofway in order to promote certainty encourage competition and avoid litigation the city will at the request and sole option of an applicant or permittee consider entering into a consent agreement for use of the public rightsofway for the provision of telecommunications services on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to the city and the telecommunications provider it is the citys intent that such an agreement would satisfy the requirement for a permit under this chapter and would include among other things a fee of up to five 5 percent of the applicable gross revenues of the telecommunications provider which would include the permit fee  an extended term of up to fifteen 15 years  authorization to conduct a local business in the city pursuant to article vii section 29 of the 1963 michigan constitution  and a covenant
