metering records taken by the heart of the valley metropolitan sewage district at the downstream end of the citys system indicate the presence of an abnormal amount of clear water entering into the sanitary sewer system the presence of this clear water reduces available capacity to all system users and causes system overloads that are manifested in reduced treatment plant capacity environmental degradation and the potential for flooded basements all of which are detrimental to the citizens of the community the city recognizes that its public sewer system has a finite life and in many cases has exceeded the useful life of the system the city also recognizes that private building sewers possess many of the same characteristics as the public sewer system b work must be authorized  no

administrative rules permits or approvals including those authorized under wis stats  28116 and 28333 2 targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the wisconsin department of natural resources under wis adm nr  2 findings of fact  the common council finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can a degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature b diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants c alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads d reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading e threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities f threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes g undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding 3 purpose and intent a purpose  the general purpose of this ordinance is to establish longterm postconstruction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health safety welfare and the aquatic environment specific purposes are to 1 further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions 2 prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater  prevent and control soil erosion  prevent and control water pollution  protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  control building sites placement of structures and land uses  preserve ground cover and scenic beauty  and promote sound economic growth 3 control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies  prevent undue channel erosion  control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter  and prevent conditions that endanger downstream

of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under wis stats
