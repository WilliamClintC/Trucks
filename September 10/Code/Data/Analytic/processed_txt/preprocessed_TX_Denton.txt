redevelopment c the developer may submit or the director may require the submission of a study prepared by a professional engineer licensed in the state of texas clearly indicating the number of water andor wastewater service units which will be consumed or generated by the new development the director will review the information for completeness and conformity with generally accepted engineering practices and will when satisfied with the completeness and conformity of the study multiply the number of service units determined by the study times the impact fee per service unit contained in section 26219 above to determine the total impact fee to be collected for the development the director may also use recent historical water billing records for existing customers to determine water demands and singlefamily equivalents sfe in accordance with data from the most recent capital improvements plan d whenever the property owner increases the number of service units for a development the additional impact fees collected for such new service units shall be determined based on schedule 2 and applicable offsets credits and discounts then in effect and such additional fee shall be assessed and collected at the time the additional meters are purchased e in the event the property owner decreases the number of service units for a development the property owner shall be entitled to a refund of the impact fee or impact fees actually paid but only for the amounts represented by the decrease in service units based on the assessed fee and offsets credits or discounts applicable at

facilities system required in whole or in part as a consequence of development excluding those public infrastructure improvements funded by development impact fees under procedures authorized by tlgc b purpose applicability and designation 1 purpose the purpose of a proportionality appeal is to assure that a requirement to dedicate construct or pay a fee for a public infrastructure improvement imposed on a proposed plat or development permit as a condition of approval does not result in a disproportionate cost burden on the property owner taking into consideration the nature and extent of the demands created by the proposed development on the citys public facilities systems 2 applicability an appeal under this section may be filed by a property owner to contest any requirement to dedicate land to construct improvements or to pay development fees other than impact fees for a public infrastructure improvement which requirement is imposed under the citys subdivision regulations

as findings pertaining to onsite improvements  the proposed or potential use of the land  the timing and sequence of development in relation to availability of adequate levels of public facilities  impact fee studies or other studies that measure the demand for services created by the development and the impact on the citys public facilities systems  the function of the public infrastructure improvements in serving the proposed development  the degree to which public infrastructure improvements to serve the subdivision are supplied by other developments  the anticipated participation by the city in the costs of such improvements  any reimbursements for the costs of public infrastructure improvements for which the proposed development is eligible  or any other information relating to the mitigating effects of the public infrastructure improvements on the impacts created by the development on the citys public facilities systems 2 the proportionality assessment must be based upon an individualized determination related both in nature and extent to the impact of the proposed development but no precise mathematical calculation is required wherever feasible and appropriate the determination may incorporate or consider applicable federal state local or regional data statistics guidelines standards methodologies or studies  or generally accepted best practices of the profession 3 based upon his proportionality determination the city engineer shall affirm that the developers portion of the costs required for infrastructure improvements does not exceed the amount that is roughly proportionate to the impacts of the proposed development 4 the city engineer may promulgate any application requirements that may assist in making the proportionality determination

intended to regulate and restrict the height of structures and objects of natural growth and the use of property in the vicinity of the denton enterprise airport to prevent the creation or establishment of obstructions that are a hazard to air navigation application of this district will help prevent the encroachment of noise sensitive or otherwise incompatible land uses which may endanger the health safety and welfare of the owners occupants or users of the land this district is also intended to implement state and federal rules associated with land uses in the vicinity of airports such state and federal rules shall apply within the mao district   municipal airport overlay district established a generally the mao district is the area generally located outside the airport boundaries and within a rectangle bounded by lines located no farther than one and onehalf statute miles from the centerline of an instrument or primary runway and no farther than five statute miles from each end of the paved surface of precision instrument runways where only a portion of a lot or parcel is within the boundaries explained above the entire parcel shall be subject to the mao regulations b subdistricts established the mao district imposes two types of overlay zoning districts that combine with existing and future zoning district regulations 1 airport height hazard district ahhd the airport height hazard district ahhd as established in establishes height limitations on structures and natural objects within an area generally traversed by the flight tracks of aircraft using the denton enterprise airport 2 airport compatibility land use district aclud the airport compatibility land use district aclud as established in establishes land use compatibility regulations

determined by the director that a structure is located within a single airport zoning subdistrict then the provisions of that subdistrict shall apply to such structure  or 2 it is determined by the director that a structure is located outside any airport zoning district then the provisions of the standard zoning district in which the structure is located shall apply   conflicts with other provisions a where there exists a conflict between any standard restriction limitation requirement or regulation prescribed by this section and any other applicable regulation the provisions of this section shall govern and prevail  provided that the more stringent limitation or requirement shall control in the event of a conflict with respect to the height of a structure or object of natural growth b in the event of a conflict between the requirements of this ddc and any provision of state law state law requirements shall prevail c consistent with tlgc   it is the intent of this section that federal laws or rules controlling the use of land located adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of an airport as they may be amended from time to time that impose more stringent limitations than are imposed under provisions herein set forth shall be applied to any application submitted under this section until such time as the city is able to conform its airport zoning regulations to such law or rules   exemptions unless otherwise provided in this ddc the following shall be exempt from the provisions of this section a areas in the horizontal zone and conical zone any natural objects or structures less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground except when because of terrain land contour or topographic features such objects or structures would extend above the height

washington  new york new york  and st croix county wisconsin  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the city council finds a sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises b certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this section as adult theaters and adult cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments c sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those that provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows d offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions e persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses f at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections g according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts h sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities i numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films j

telecommunications facilities   purpose and goals a the purpose of this section is to establish guidelines regulating the location of telecommunication towers and antennas with the objective of minimizing their number to protect and promote public safety and to mitigate any adverse visual impacts on the community while promoting the provision of telecommunications service to the public b the goals of these regulations are to 1 protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas  2 encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas  3 minimize the total number of towers throughout the community  4 encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional singleuse towers  5 encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them to the extent possible in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal  6 encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact design siting landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques  7 enhance the ability of providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly effectively and efficiently  and 8 avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure careful siting of tower structures   compliance with

gas wells 61  integrated provisions   gas well development and 63 gas well drilling and production relating to gas well development are intended as a set of integrated regulations each section may incorporate by reference other applicable provisions of this ddc that pertain to gas well development   gas well drilling and production contains definitions that apply to all provisions regulating gas well development and identifies impact mitigation standards and other general standards that apply to gas well development  in addition to this subchapter subchapter 5 use regulations establishes zoning classifications for gas well development and gas well development plat establishes platting requirements and procedures for gas well development 62  gas well development   purpose authority and applicability a purpose the drilling and production of gas and the development of gas well facilities within the corporate limits of the city necessitate promulgation of reasonable regulations to prevent devaluation of property  to protect watersheds  to ensure that gas well drilling and production activities are compatible with adjacent land uses throughout the duration of such activities  and to assure that such activities conform to the denton plan the regulations contained in  gas well development  subchapter 8 subdivisions  and  gas well drilling and production are designed to protect the health safety and general welfare of the public and to assure that the orderly and practical development of mineral resources is compatible with the quiet enjoyment of affected surface estates the regulations contained in  gas well development  subchapter 8 subdivisions  and  gas well drilling and production are designed to implement the purposes set forth in this subsection and are supported by the following findings of fact 1 gas well drilling and production activities create externalities that potentially threaten the health safety and general welfare of persons residing or working on property in proximity to such operations 2 gas well drilling and production activities in the absence of local regulatory controls may emit high noise levels produce large volumes of dust congest local streets present fire hazards and produce other deleterious effects all of which fall disproportionately on adjacent land uses and which can result individually or cumulatively in injury to persons destabilization of property values and inhibit the quiet peace and enjoyment of surface uses of real property in the vicinity of such operations 3 the city of denton recognizes that the united states and the state of texas primarily regulate gas well drilling and production activities moreover with the enactment of house bill 40 on  texas natural resources  the state of texas has exclusive jurisdiction over gas well drilling and production activities municipalities are preempted from regulating said activities except as allowed in c which expressly provides that a municipality has authority to regulate certain aspects of aboveground activity related to oil and gas operations the regulations in this subchapter are intended to regulate under such authority in order to implement compatible local objectives that assure the health safety and general welfare of the citys residents and businesses 4 the proliferation of gas wells and drilling and production sites within the city of denton creates conflicts between such developments and other existing and future surface uses of the property in order to assure the compatibility of residential commercial and industrial uses with gas well development it is necessary for the city to separate gas well development from other surface uses within the city b authority this subchapter 6 gas wells is adopted pursuant to authority vested under the constitution and laws of the united states the state of texas and the city of denton each authorization identified in this subchapter 6 gas wells shall be construed as an exercise of the citys zoning powers pursuant to the denton city charter tlgc chapters 211 and 212 and the provisions of subchapter 3 zoning districts of this ddc as well as an exercise of its

district 3 in order to foster compatible land use within zoning districts gas well development within the corporate limits of the city will be subject to reasonable setbacks from protected uses and residential subdivisions which vary according to the types of uses authorized in each district because many gas wells are already in close proximity to existing protected uses or residential subdivisions setbacks standards within districts will vary according to whether the proposed gas well development takes place on an existing site or a new site 4 a drilling and production site setback is the distance that the site must be separated by an operator from an existing protected use or residential subdivision a reverse setback is the distance that a protected use or residential subdivision must be separated by a surface owner from an approved drilling and production site a minimum setback is the minimum distance of separation between a drilling and production site and a protected use or residential subdivision after a waiver or variance is granted to reduce the setback requirement a minimum reverse setback is the minimum distance a protected use or residential lot

pro rata charge calculated in accordance with this subsection would not be equitable because the actual average daily sewage flow or peak flow from a particular building structure or land use is much greater or smaller than the normal projected average daily flow or peak flow on which such pro rata charge is based the directors of water and wastewater utilities may based upon evidence of such greater or smaller actual daily sewage flow or peak flow require a payment of a greater or smaller pro rata charge as a condition to the connection to use of or continued use of a lift station or force main which is subject to a pro rata reimbursement agreement in such cases the assistant city manager of utilities shall give written notice to such person required to make such pro rata payment of the basis for the actual pro rata charge and such person may within 30 days thereafter appeal such determination to the public utilities board the board shall within a reasonable time thereafter

further the purpose and intent of these regulations flexible process reviewed and approved by the director for one of the following purposes a to allow trees measuring below the minimum dbh to be counted for protected trees when i the allowance would result in the preservation of a greater number of post oak trees regardless of dbh  or ii the preservation of protected trees would cause a substantial burden but smaller dbh nonsecondary trees are located in such a way that the trees can be incorporated into the site design such as the parking lot buffer or front yard landscaping b to allow secondary trees to count towards the minimum required preservation instead of quality trees 2 criteria for approval a the proposed alternative tree preservationreplacement plan adequately achieves or is an improvement on the intent of the requirements of this subsection  and b the proposed site design has minimized the loss of protected trees to the greatest extent possible or has maintained existing tree stands 3 replacement trees required replacement and mitigation contained in paragraphs h and i shall be required for those alternatives in paragraph f1 above g minimum

council is a final determination 3 criteria for approval in deciding whether to grant relief to the applicant the city council shall consider whether there is any evidence from which it can reasonably conclude that the application of all or a part of the provisions of this ddc that apply to tree preservation may deprive the applicant of all economically viable use of the property based on the following factors a whether there is a unique physical circumstance on the property b whether the proposed design has minimized the loss of trees to the extent possible c whether preservation andor mitigation unduly burdens the development of the property k alternatives to tree replacement requirements in order to satisfy the mitigation dbh the property owner may use any combination of alternative methods of compliance listed below these alternative methods may also be used in combination with or in lieu of tree replacement so long as the total replacement dbh is satisfied by one or
