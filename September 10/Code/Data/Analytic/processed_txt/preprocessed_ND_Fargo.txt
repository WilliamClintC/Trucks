reduce temptation and opportunity to better protect its citizens  especially children the elderly and other at risk populations the city contends that without the benefit of a behavioral program intended to reduce the rate of recidivism the tendency of a convicted felon to relapse into a previous mode of behavior especially criminal behavior is amplified by cohabitation with groups of other convicted felons this regulation is aimed at protecting the health and safety of citizens in the city of fargo from the risk of convicted felons by establishing a minimum distance at which a group living facility housing convicted felons can be established where children the elderly at other at risk populations tend to congregate or be regularly present it is not the intent of this article to impose a criminal penalty but rather to serve the citys compelling interest to promote protect and improve the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by maintaining safety zones around locations where at risk populations regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein convicted felons are prohibited from establishing a permanent group living situation 2 characteristics group

alternative residential development options a general 1 purpose the alternative development options of this section allow for variety in development standards while maintaining the overall character of a singledwelling neighborhood these options have several public benefits a they allow for development which is more sensitive to the environment especially in hilly areas and areas with water features and natural drainageways  b they allow for the preservation of open and natural areas  c they promote better site layout and opportunities for private recreational areas  d they promote opportunities for affordable housing  and e they promote energyefficient development 2 general the alternative development options listed in this section are allowed byright unless otherwise expressly stated the project must comply with all of the applicable development standards of this section the project must also comply with all other development standards of the base zoning district unless those standards are superceded by the standards in this section the alternative development options listed in this section are not applicable to sr0 zoning districts b attached housing 1 lot width lot area building coverage and density attached housing is exempt from the lot width lot area and building coverage standards of the underlying zoning district but shall not be exempt from the maximum density standards 2 setbacks no interior side setback is required on the attached side of a lot containing an attached house the front side and rear setback standards shall apply around the perimeter of an attached housing development 3 number of attached units in the sr3 district no single structure may contain more than 8 units c zero lot line 1 description a zero lot line development is where houses in a development on a common street frontage are shifted to one side of their lot this provides for greater usable yard space on each lot these developments require that planning for all of the house locations be done at the same time because the exact location of each house is predetermined greater flexibility in site development standards are possible while assuring that singledwelling character is maintained 2 applicability zero lot line developments are allowed for houses in the sr1 zoning districts 3 procedure zero lot line developments are allowed byright review for compliance with the standards of this section shall occur during the subdivision platting process restrictions that assure the minimum distance between houses and any required easements must be recorded on the plats of the applicable lots proof of such recordation must be submitted as part of the building permit application 4 setbacks the side building setback on one side of the house may be reduced to zero this reduction does not apply to the street side setback or to the interior side setback adjacent to lots that are not part of the zero lot line project 5 additional standards a distance between houses the minimum distance between all buildings in the development must be equal to twice the required side setback required by the underlying zoning district a deed restriction must be recorded on the deed of each applicable lot to ensure continued compliance with this setback b eaves the eaves on the side of a house with a reduced setback may project a maximum of 18 inches over the adjacent property line in this case an easement for the eave projection must be recorded on the deed for the lot where the projection occurs c maintenance easement an easement between the two property owners to allow for maintenance or repair of the house is required when the eaves or side wall of the house are within 4 feet of the adjacent property line the easement on the adjacent property must provide at least 5 feet of unobstructed space between the furthermost project of the structure and the edge of the easement d privacy if the side wall of the house is on the property line or within 3 feet of the property line windows or other openings that allow for visibility into the side yard of the adjacent lot are not allowed windows that do not allow visibility into the side yard of the adjacent lot such as a clerestory window or a translucent window are allowed d cluster development a cluster development is a residential subdivision in which the lots are allowed to be smaller in area and width than otherwise required for the underlying base zoning district but in which the overall density cannot exceed the maximum density limit for the underlying zoning district under the cluster development option a subdivision can contain no more lots than would otherwise be allowed for a conventional subdivision in the same zoning district but the individual lots within the development could be smaller than required in a conventional subdivision smaller lot sizes within a cluster development are required to be offset by a corresponding increase in open space 1 conflict with other regulations if there is a conflict between the cluster development standards of this chapter and any other requirement of this land development the standards of this chapter control otherwise a cluster development is subject to all other applicable requirements of this land development where allowed cluster developments are allowed in all sr zoning districts 3 approval procedure cluster developments are subject to the subdivision procedures of  density a cluster development is subject to the maximum density requirements of the base zoning district 5 lot size there is no set minimum lot size area or width requirement within a cluster development individual lot sizes must be adequate to meet all required density and development standards minimum lot sizes may be established by the planning commission or board of city commissioners during the subdivision process 6 setbacks and building separations the minimum setback standards of the base zoning district apply along the perimeter of a cluster development all detached structures within a cluster development must be separated by a minimum distance of 10 feet 7 open space a onsite open space cluster developments shall be subject to the minimum onsite open space standards of the base zoning district if applicable b common open space 1 minimum requirement common open space is required within a cluster development to ensure that the overall density within the development does not exceed the maximum density allowed by the underlying zoning district common open space must be provided in an amount at least equal to the difference between 1 the actual average lot area per dwelling unit within the cluster development and 2 the required lot area per dwelling unit for conventional development within the underlying base zoning district 2 use of common open space common open space must be set aside and designated as an area where no development will occur other than projectrelated recreational amenities or passive open space areas the planning commission may require that up to 50 percent of required common open space be useable open space if deemed necessary by the planning commission or board of city commissioners to ensure adequate recreational amenities for residents of the development source 3062 2000 200507  attached development the alternative development options of this section allow for

sidewalk waiver request based on the guidelines of this subsection and the facts surrounding the waiver request based on such factors the planning commission may recommend denial of a sidewalk waiver request even though the request may be technically eligible for such a waiver the planning commission has established the following statement of principles as a foundation for reviewing requests for sidewalk waivers 1 sidewalks are a shared amenity and asset of the community as such the public interest in sidewalks transcend specific individuals lots subdivisions or periods of time 2 sidewalks represent an important element of the transportation system and as such they provide an element of safety for both the automobile user and the pedestrian including children on bikes 3 sidewalks are an important element in the inventory of recreational assets of the community 4 to meet their potential as elements of the transportation and recreational components of the community accessibility and convenience are factors of real importance 5 sidewalks both as a transportation facility and as a recreational asset must also consider and assume that vulnerable populations should be and will be found in most areas of the city availability and functionality are particularly important to children under 14 persons with disabilities and senior citizens 6 sidewalks that are not built can create an uneven or unfair burden of cost maintenance and use 7 sidewalk plans that offer creative solutions but that are substantially equal substitutes to the traditional sidewalk should be encouraged b industrial no maximum sidewalk waiver will apply to industrial subdivisions c alternative sidewalk plan sidewalk waivers may be granted at the time of approval of a subdivision if a substitute pedestrian way or trail is incorporated that provides substantially equal service to a sidewalk on a block face even when there are more than 12 dwelling units per block an example would be a midblock trail pedestrian way or bike path pedestrian ways or trails that tend to force midblock pedestrian crossings should be avoided or be given special design consideration figure 2006095 sidewalk alternative d rural subdivisions and city consolidations if the city annexes a rural subdivision or consolidates with an incorporated community a temporary waiver for the entire subdivision may be granted for up to 10 years after which the subdivision will be subject to the same regulations that apply in the rest of the city this guideline may be superceded by the applicable annexation or consolidation agreement e timing of sidewalk construction sidewalk installation will not be ordered in until street improvements such as paving curb and gutter are constructed f missing or conflicting guidelines when conditions arise that are not covered by the sidewalk waiver guidelines of this section or where guidelines suggest contradictory solutions the planning commission will make a determination that best reflects the general intent of the guidelines such determination will be kept on file and used in similar cases g effect of existing sidewalks the construction and existence of sidewalks that would have been eligible for consideration for a waiver do not create by their existence the automatic requirement for a sidewalk that would also be eligible for a waiver the city may evaluate such requests as though all the eligible sidewalks had been waived on the condition that reasonable continuity and consistency of pedestrian service is provided source 4700 2009 200610  river

principal use a developments with multiple principal uses when all principal uses of a development fall within one use category the entire development is assigned to that use category a development

principal uses of a development fall within different use categories each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that category b accessory uses accessory uses are allowed byright in conjunction with a principal use unless otherwise stated in the regulations also unless otherwise stated accessory uses are subject to the same regulations as the principal use common accessory uses are listed as examples in the use category descriptions c use of examples the examples subsection of each use category lists common examples of uses included in the respective use category the names of these sample uses are generic they are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself for example a use that calls itself wholesale warehouse but that sells mostly to consumers is included in the retail sales and service category rather than the wholesale sales category this is because the actual activity on the

a authority this article shall be part of the land development of the fargo municipal  in all respects including the interpretation enforcement and remedies for violation hereof this article may be referred to as the sign code this article is also enacted as provided in article 2503 of the fargo municipal references therein to the fargo sign  shall be to this article as the same may be amended from time to time b findings the board of city commissioners hereby finds as follows 1 exterior signs have a substantial impact on the character and quality of the environment 2 signs provide an important medium individuals may convey a variety of messages 3 signs can create safety hazards that threaten the public health safety or welfare such a safety threat is particularly great for signs that are structurally inadequate or that may confuse or distract drivers or pedestrians or that may interfere with official directional or warning signs 4 signs can also threaten the public welfare by creating aesthetic concerns and detriments to property values such aesthetic concerns and detriments to property values are particularly great when an accumulation or proliferation of signs results in visual clutter or when one or more signs spoil vistas or views or when one or more signs add or increase commercialism in noncommercial areas 5 the ability to erect signs serving certain functions such as an address sign or a sign announcing that the property on which it sits is for sale or for lease is an integral part of nearly every property owners ability to realize the fundamental attributes of property ownership the same cannot be said for signs serving other functions such as billboards erected so as to be visible from public rightsofway such signs are primarily designed to take advantage of an audience drawn to that location by the publics substantial investment in rightsofway and other public property 6 signs serving certain other functions such as small signs that serve a purely directional function are necessary to enable visitors or residents to efficiently reach their intended destinations experience teaches that citizens often plan as if such signs will be present in those settings so in the absence of such signs frustration and disorientation will result and time and fuel will be wasted such signs also prevent traffic hazards by easing the task of the motorist looking for a property open house or other events 7 no signs that exceed the size or spacing limitations of this ordinance constitute a customary use of signage in the city 8 the city has prohibited obscene or indecent signs to protect the health safety general welfare and morals of the residents of the city to preserve the quality of family life to preserve the characteristics of its neighborhoods and to prevent adverse and deleterious effects contributing to the flight and downgrading of neighborhoods the city is mindful of the negative effects of obscene and indecent material upon minors and the criminal activity and disruption of the public peace associated with such establishments 9 with respect to lost animal signs notices in newspapers or other means of communicating this information are inadequate notice of the animals loss near the site of the loss is necessary to increase the likelihood and timeliness of the animals return to its owner and promotes the governments interest in avoiding euthanasia and the other costs attendant upon stray animals 10 the city recognizes businesses are committed to responding to community needs and are willing to use their advertising dollars to alert civic minded individuals of community issues of common importance ancillary offpremise advertising signs and community wide event signs provide businesses the opportunity to support schools promote service clubs raise money for charities sponsor a community event or other activities that otherwise may be considered offpremise advertising 11 in narrowly drawing and tailoring provisions for regulating signage the city finds and determines that the exercise of its police power for such regulation should not extend to objects that are not typically associated with or considered signage such as artwork decorations or cemetery markers however to prevent the purposes of these regulations from being circumvented such regulations should apply where objects such as vehicles are used for the primary purpose of signage or as a functional equivalent of signage 12 nonconforming signs may adversely affect the public health safety and welfare such signs may adversely affect the aesthetic characteristics of the city and may adversely affect public safety due to the visual impact of said signs on motorists and the structural characteristics of said signs in addition overprotection of prior nonconforming uses and structures can unjustifiably delay the point at which nonconforming uses and structures are gradually eliminated due to obsolescence and similar causes and can unfairly provide existing businesses with an unfair competitive advantage over new competitors because those new competitors are uniformly required to comply with existing standards 13 the citys landuse regulations have included the regulation of signs in an effort to foster adequate information and means of expression and to promote the economic viability of the community while protecting the city and its citizens from a proliferation of signs of a type size number location and character that would adversely impact upon the aesthetics of the community or threaten health safety or the welfare of the community the appropriate regulation of the physical characteristics of signs in the city and other communities has had a positive impact on the safety and the appearance of the community 14 prior to the adoption of this ordinance the city has from time to time utilized conditional overlays as a tool to limit the overall area or height of signage or both the area and height of signage on particular parcels deemed to be design sensitive the intent of this ordinance is in part to serve as the definitive guidance for signage issues and thereby not rely upon conditional overlays as a matter of course c interpretation the following shall be used as methods of interpreting this ordinance 1 where any provision of this ordinance imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision or any other regulation ordinance statute or provision of law the provision which is most restrictive or imposes higher standards shall govern 2 the

other provision of law 4 this ordinance is not intended to abrogate any covenant or any other private agreement or restriction provided that where the provisions of this ordinance are more restrictive
