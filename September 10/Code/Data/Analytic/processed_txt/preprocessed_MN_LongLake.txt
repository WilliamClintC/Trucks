of the city of long lake to prevent and remedy the degradation of the quality of surface and ground waters as well as public and private land resources in order to protect the health safety and general welfare of the public all acts or failures to act by persons which may result in the degradation of such water and land resources is considered to be a public nuisance in accordance with but not limited to the public nuisance section of the city minnesota statutes 19 and 14437 and as hereinafter specifically defined 2 specific public nuisances the following items are public nuisances a erosion and sedimentation the deposition of measurable amounts of soil by wind or water action into public road ditches natural or manmade watercourses ditches wetlands shorelands and water bodies or adjoining private properties is a public nuisance provided such deposition is related to the failure of a land owner or occupier to apply accepted soil erosion b deposition or disposal the deposition or disposal of any substance onto land or into a watercourse or water body which in its present or  amended  decomposed state may release nutrients or chemicals into ground and surface waters or otherwise impair water resources is a public nuisance such substances include but are not limited to fertilizers pesticides plant or animal parts or waste garbage refuse demolition material sewage sludge petrochemicals toxic salts and other hazardous materials c excavation and fill activities the excavation of any material from or placement of any fill material into any manmade or natural watercourse wetland lake or other water body without necessary local state or federal authorizations is a public nuisance h discharge prohibitions a prohibition of illegal discharges no person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any materials including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards other than storm water the commencement conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows 1 the following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this ordinance water line flushing or other potable water sources landscape irrigation or lawn watering diverted stream flows rising ground water ground water infiltration to storm drains uncontaminated pumped ground water foundation or footing drains not including active groundwater dewatering systems crawl space pumps air conditioning condensation springs noncommercial washing of vehicles natural riparian habitat or wetland flows swimming pools if dechlorinated  typically less than one ppm chlorine fire fighting activities and any other water source not containing pollutants 2 discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety 3 dye testing is an allowable discharge but requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the test 4 the prohibition shall not apply to any nonstorm water discharge permitted under an npdes permit waiver or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the federal environmental protection agency provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit waiver or order and other applicable laws and regulations and provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system  amended  b prohibition of illicit connections 1 the construction use maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited 2 this prohibition expressly includes without limitation illicit connections made in the past regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of the connection 3 a person is considered to be in violation of this ordinance if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the ms4 or allows such a connection to continue i suspension of ms4 access a suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations the city council may without prior notice suspend ms4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent and substantial danger to the environment or the health or welfare of persons or to the ms4 or waters of the united states if the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the ms4 or waters of the united states or to minimize danger to persons b suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge any person discharging to the ms4 in violation of this ordinance may have their ms4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge the authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its ms4 access the violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for reconsideration and a hearing a person commits an offense if the person reinstates ms4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency j industrial or construction activity discharges a any person subject to an industrial or construction activity npdes storm water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the city council prior to the allowing of discharges to the ms4  amended  k monitoring of discharges a applicability this section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity including construction activity

enforcement agency to conduct monitoring andor sampling of the facilitys storm water discharge iv the authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary the facilitys sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense all devises used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy v any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected andor sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency and shall not be replaced the costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator vi unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency access to a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this ordinance a person who is the operator of the facility with a npdes permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the  amended  purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this ordinance vii if the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged and the city is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this ordinance or that there is a need to inspect andor sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this ordinance or any order issued hereunder or to protect the overall public health safety and welfare
