recharge to compensate for the reduction in the percolation that occurs when the ground surface is paved and roofed over these measures are encouraged particularly in hydrologic soil groups a and b and shall be utilized wherever feasible b the criteria for maintaining recharge is based on the usda average annual recharge volume per soil type divided by the annual rainfall in union county 40 inches per year and multiplied by 90% this keeps the recharge calculation consistent with the wqv methodology thus an annual recharge volume requirement shall be specified for a site as follows 1

cover and no proposed disturbance during development may be excluded from the rev calculations designers are encouraged to use these areas as nonstructural practices for rev treatment 5 the rev and wqv are inclusive when treated separately the rev may be subtracted from the wqv when sizing the water quality bmp 6 rechargeinfiltration facilities may be used in conjunction with other innovative or traditional bmps stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management alternatives c basis for determining recharge volume 1 if more than one hydrologic soil group hsg is present at a site a composite soil specific recharge factor shall be computed based on the proportion of total site area within each hsg the recharge volume provided at the site shall be directed to the most permeable hsg available 2 the percent volume method is used to determine the rev treatment requirement when structural practices are used to provide recharge these practices must provide seepage into the ground and may include infiltration and exfiltration structures eg infiltration bioretention dry swales or sand filters with storage below the under drain structures that require impermeable liners intercept groundwater or are designed for trapping sediment eg forbays may not be used in this method the volume of runoff treated by structural practices shall meet or exceed the computed recharge volume 3 the percent area method is used to determine the rev treatment requirements when nonstructural practices are used under this method the recharge requirements are evaluated by mapping the percent of impervious area that is effectively treated by an acceptable nonstructural practice and comparing it to the minimum recharge requirements 4 acceptable nonstructural practices include filter strips that treat rooftop or parking lot runoff sheet flow discharge to stream buffers and grass channels that treat roadway runoff 5 the recharge volume criterion does not apply to any portion of a site designated as a stormwater hotspot or any project considered as redevelopment in addition the municipal engineer may alter or eliminate the recharge volume requirement if the site is situated on unsuitable soils eg marine clays karst or in an urban redevelopment area in this situation nonstructural practices percent area method shall be implemented to the maximum extent practicable and the remaining or untreated rev included in the wqv treatment  29018 lewisburg code  29018   29019 channel protection storage volume stream bank erosion 6 if rev is treated by

believed that test results are not reasonable 2 extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in geologically susceptible areas such as strip mine or limestone areas extreme caution shall also be exercised where salt or chloride would be a pollutant since soils do little to filter this pollutant and it may contaminate the groundwater it is also extremely important that the design professional evaluates the possibility of groundwater contamination from the proposed infiltrationrecharge facility and recommends a hydrogeologic justification study be performed if necessary whenever a basin will be located in an area underlain by limestone a geological evaluation of the proposed location shall be conducted to determine susceptibility to sinkhole formations the design of all facilities over limestone formations shall include measures to prevent ground water contamination and where necessary sinkhole formation 3 the borough may require the installation of an impermeable liner in detention basins underlain by limestone or in areas of karst topography a detailed hydrogeologic investigation may be required by the borough the developer may also be required to provide safeguards against groundwater contamination for uses which may cause groundwater contamination should there be an accident or spill e all rechargeinfiltration facilities shall be designed to

that are stocked with trout based upon the most recent resource classification or other appropriate documentation of the pennsylvania fish and boat commission or other appropriate agency only 12 hours of extended detention shall be provided the rationale for this criterion is that runoff will be stored and released in such a gradual manner that critical erosive velocities during bankfull and nearbankfull events will seldom be exceeded in downstream channels c basis for determining channel protection storage volume 1 the models hechms tr55 and tr20 or an equivalent approved by the municipal engineer shall be used for determining peak discharge rates 2 the rainfall depth for the oneyear twentyfourhour storm event in union county is 22 inches 3 offsite areas shall be modeled as

shall be computed using the detention lag time between hydrograph procedures outlined in appendix n of this chapter the detention lag time t for a oneyear storm is defined as the interval between the center of mass of the inflow hydrograph and the center of mass of the outflow hydrograph 6 cpv is not required at sites where the oneyear postdevelopment peak discharge qi is less than or equal to 20 cfs a cpv orifice diameter do of less than 30 inches is subject to approval by the municipal engineer and is not recommended unless an internal control for orifice protection is used 7 cpv shall be addressed for the entire site if a site consists of multiple drainage areas cpv may be distributed proportionately to each drainage area 8 extended detention storage provided for the cpv does not meet
