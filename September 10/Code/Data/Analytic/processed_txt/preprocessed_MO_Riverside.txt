protect the health safety and general welfare therefore the board of aldermen of the city of riverside missouri ordains as follows findings of fact flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of the city of riverside missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which
