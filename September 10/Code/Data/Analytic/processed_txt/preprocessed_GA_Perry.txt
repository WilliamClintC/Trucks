the city that alcohol and controlled substance abuse is the number one health problem in the united states today the costs involved with this problem include lost jobs morale problems injuries illnesses and deaths as well as economic costs such as property damage tardiness absenteeism lost productivity increased health insurance costs and the costs involved in replacing and retraining new employees the use of alcohol and controlled substances by the city employees while on the job constitutes a direct threat to property and the safety of others the work involved in many positions is inherently dangerous and the safety of citizens and fellow employees depends upon the ability of employees to think clearly with unimpaired faculties it is the objective of the city to provide safe and effective public service to meet this objective the problem of alcohol and controlled substance abuse must be identified confronted and defeated in order to achieve this the city has developed a comprehensive alcohol and controlled substance policy this policy consists of three 3 interrelated programs 1 an employee educationsupervisor training program  2 an employee assistance program eap  and 3 an alcohol and controlled substance testing program although these programs cost money to implement they should prove to be cost effective if they eradicate alcohol and controlled substance abuse among all employees the city considers its employees to be its most valuable resource and sincerely wishes to assist its employees with any alcohol or controlled substance related problems they might have as used in this policy the term controlled substance shall have the meaning and include the substances defined as controlled substances in the georgia controlled substance act ocga  161320

participating in a rehabilitation program random testing will be conducted at least quarterly for a twelvemonth period see attachment e  31604 a procedural guide to the city alcohol and controlled substance policy a introduction the problem of alcohol and controlled substance abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the united states although controlled substance abuse continues to receive a large amount of attention from the news media alcohol remains the biggest substance abuse problem in the american workplace it is likely that some of these individuals are employed by the city although it would be pleasant to assume that all employees never break the law or report to work under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance such an ostrichlike approach ignores the fact that substance abuse is a major public health problem this problem must be squarely dealt with employees abusing alcohol and controlled substances are more apt to be involved in accidents and have a higher absentee rate than nonabusers to combat this problem the city has developed a comprehensive alcohol and controlled substance policy that shall apply to all employees b overview of the alcohol and controlled substance policy the alcohol and controlled substance policy of the city is made up of three 3 separate but interrelated programs 1 an employee awarenesssupervisor training program  2 an employee assistance program eap  3 an alcohol and controlled substance screening test program the overall responsibility for the alcohol and controlled substance policy lies with the program manager see attachment f drug tests and any other expenditures for program costs will be cleared approved by the personnel director and the city manager although it was already prohibited for an employee of the city to be under the influence of alcohol andor nonprescribed drugs on the job this alcohol and controlled substance policy was developed to prevent illicit use of alcohol or controlled substances by city employees without violating the legal rights of those employees in order to do this it is necessary that supervisors at every level within the city understand the policy follow the policy and give the policy their full support this will lead to greater acceptance and understanding of the policy more easily attained the policy has five 5 primary goals these are a prevention to prevent the abuse of alcohol and controlled substances by the city employees it is universally accepted that alcohol and controlled substance abuse is destructive yet many individuals start or continue these habits because they lack reliable information about devastating effects of alcohol and controlled substance abuse the policy seeks to educate the employees about the facts behind substance abuse so that they can see the potential effects of this behavior this should help prevent employees from developing alcohol or controlled substancerelated problems the policy also seeks to educate and motivate the nonusing coworkers so that they will encourage employees to seek help peer group pressure can be an extremely powerful force the policy also seeks to communicate to the employees the fact that the city is concerned about alcohol and controlled substance abuse among its employees and that the city will do everything within its power to prevent such abuse b cost effectiveness to combat the abuse of alcohol and controlled substance in a way that is cost effective although alcohol and controlled substance abuse is recognized primarily for its human costs the economic costs associated with the problem are also unacceptable properly instituted the policy will increase worker productivity and decrease absenteeism accidents and health care costs as a good many of the workers affected by the policy are in safetysensitive positions the policy will also help decrease the changes of the city being held legally liable for acts committed by an impaired employee finally the policy should improve employee retention rates thereby lowering employee turnover costs such as hiring and training new employees to replace those who have quit or have been terminated due to alcohol and controlled substance abuse c clear communication of citys policy to clearly communicate the position of the city regarding the abuse of alcohol and controlled substances the policy seeks to effectively communicate to each employee and the general public the position that alcohol and controlled substance abuse will not be tolerated among employees of the city employee awareness of this position and of the mechanisms to enforce this position should act as a deterrent to substance abuse additionally awareness on the part of employees may encourage those who believe they might have a problem to seek assistance awareness of the provisions of the policy should lead to greater compliance with the policy by all employees furthermore publicity about the policy should act to increase public respect for the employees of the city implementing such a policy reassures the citizens that city employees are not entitled to a double standard that they do in fact obey the law and that they will continue to serve as role models for citizens of all ages the policy will also reassure the public that city services paid for by tax dollars are the safest and most effective services available d provide assistance to alcoholcontrolled substance dependent employees to provide assistance to employees who need it a chemically dependent individual is not able to control hisher alcohol or controlled substance intake the policy recognizes this fact by providing for discretionary department director referral to the employee assistance program see attachment f this in not a device for the employee to use to get around the rules rather the decision to terminate or to refer to the eap is to be made in accordance with this policy the decision to terminate an employee is a drastic one with personal economic and possible legal consequences it is not a decision to be made lightly if an employee has exhibited substance dependence it may be more beneficial to the city and the employee to present that employee with a firm choice between rehabilitation or termination most experts agree that a substance abuser must face a firm choice before a rehabilitation program can succeed this is not to say that all employees violating the alcohol and controlled substance policy will be given a firm choice if an employees policy violation does not involve evidence of alcoholcontrolled substance dependence there would be no reason to refer the employee to eap e legal method of control to provide a legal means to employee control one of the challenges facing the city is to devise a way to test employees for alcohol or controlled substance use that would withstand legal challenge it is necessary for the city to control its employees as it may be held liable for injuries to coworkers or the public caused by impaired employees at the same time the city employees have rights that need to be protected the policy balances these two interests by stating precisely what is expected of the employees as well as explaining what will happen should a violation occur c specific guidelines on policy administration the preceding section of this guide discussed some of the general considerations behind the alcohol and controlled substance policy the next section of the guide will provide practical assistance in implementing the three 3 programs within the policy 1 implementing the alcoholcontrolled substance awareness program the basic idea behind this program is that employee alcoholcontrolled substance abuse can be prevented by supplying the employees with information about the problems alcoholcontrolled substance abuse can create the awareness program is subdivided into two 2 sections an employee education section to include all city employees and a supervisor training section the city will work with local resources to provide instruction and materials for training programs awareness services are provided by various hospitals clinics and organizations such as alcoholics anonymous the employee education section will provide a educational seminars  b questionnaires at both the start and the completion of the program to chart beliefknowledge changes  c audiovisual programs  d group discussions  e a presentation of what a treatment program is what it does and how to take advantage of one  and f a description and discussion of the city alcohol and controlled substance policy the supervisor training section will focus on the important role supervisors have in preventing alcoholcontrolled substance abuse this program will include a instruction in identifying warning signs of alcoholcontrolled substance abuse by employees  b roleplaying scenarios  c group discussions  d firstline supervisors and upperlevel supervisors during which firstline supervisors should be assured of the support they will receive should they intervene with a problem employee  and e a thorough presentation of the alcohol and controlled substance policy with particular emphasis placed upon the procedural requirements involved with disciplining employees 2 implementing the employee assistance program a the employee assistance program the reference point and clearing house of the eap will be the houston health care complex the eap will be provided with proper resources to interview employees and refer them to appropriate rehabilitationtreatment programs the eap office will not be located in the department of personnel employees will be hesitant to avail themselves of the eap if it appears adverse employment action will be taken against them in spite of the employer assurance to the contrary the confidentiality of the records of the coordinator will be assured to further promote employee trust and confidence in the eap for purposes of statistical reporting names and dates will not be released however the coordinator will have the authority to sideline an employee who has informed the coordinator that heshe is presently impaired the notion of confidentiality does not give an impaired employee the right to continue working simply because heshe accessed the eap in such a situation the coordinator will seek a disability leave or some other type of action that will not label the employee as an alcoholic or drug user b employees completion of eap if an employee must take time off to take part in a rehabilitation program the absence will be treated as sick leave annual or leave without pay for seniority purposes if the employee was referred to the eap by his department director or his designee upon returning to work the employee will be subject to unannounced alcoholcontrolled substance screening tests for a period of twelve 12 months these tests will be administered approximately every three 3 months with an emphasis on postweekend monday testing however an element of surprise must be retained so a fixed schedule will not be established management should refrain from directing the administration of more than one 1 screening test per month unless the circumstances clearly require more frequent testing c financing the eap an outside eap professional will be utilized as the eap coordinator at no charge the cost of the rehabilitation programs themselves will be covered as any other medical problem by the employees health insurance 3 implementing the alcohol and controlled substances screening test program a establishing necessary test procedure the first step in implementing the screening test program will be to provide employees proper notice copies of the alcohol and controlled substance policy will be distributed to each affected employee house orientation programs within each department and bulletin board postings after policy distribution has occurred the city will establish a professional relationship with a quality laboratory certified dhhs the city will establish the procedure involved with the collection of samples samples will be collected at the alcohol testing laboratoryagent or drug testing collection agency see attachment f  samples will not be collected at the workplace the samples will be carefully checked and marked with the name of the employee the date the sample was collected and the location where the sample was collected a chain of custodycontrol will be established so that samples are properly handled before testing occurs every effort must be made to assure that the sample being tested is the sample actually collected from the employeeapplicant in question when testing for alcohol the standard breathalyser used for dui suspects is sufficient the city policy is that any alcohol content bac level indicates policy violation the employee has the right to request a blood test if heshe so desires this test will be conducted at the employees expense although some laboratories have their own policies the city will establish which chemical tests are to be performed on the urine samples for controlled substance testing urine samples will be used and the presence of foreign metabolites in urine will indicate a violation of this policy however alternatives such as blood tests and hair analysis may be interpreted as more intrusive and may be used if necessary there are a variety of chemical tests that can be performed on urine samples to detect controlled substance abuse the most widely used technique is called immunoassay technique the immunoassay technique has a high degree of reliability under optional conditions but can produce in certain cases false positive rates the manufacturers of the leading immunoassay counsel that every positive immunoassay test should be confirmed by another more elaborate and expensive test method the confirmatory methods include thin layer chromatography gas chromatography and gas chromatographymass spectrometry ideally all samples that test positive should be confirmed with one of the three 3 confirmatory techniques finally in establishing necessary test procedures the city will decide which substances are to be tested for the official georgia lists over one hundred ninetythree 193 controlled substances the possession or use of which is illegal the cost of individual tests for each substance would probably be prohibitive additionally urinalysis tests are directed at drug use and do not detect alcohol in the bloodstream thus the city will establish testing for alcohol by use of the breathalyser and the use of urinalysis to detect controlled substances such as marijuana thc cocaine amphetamines barbiturates etc b issues and procedures involved with testing testing will begin upon implementation of this policy the alcohol and controlled substance policy provides for testing in five 5 different situations 1 preemployment for employees in safetysensitive positions of sworn police personnel trained firefighter police reserve officers utility employees handling gas service city drivers and operators of heavy equipment 2 the reasonable suspicion test  3 following accidents of any employees involving property damage or personal injury  4 random testing when employed in safetysensitive positions which include sworn police personnel trained firefighters police reserve officers utility employees handling gas service city drivers and operators of heavy equipment 5 random testing upon return to work after participating in a rehabilitation program a the preemployment test 1 during the final interview process the job applicant for safetysensitive positions will be provided with a copy of the preemployment consent and notice form 2 at that time the alcohol and controlled substance policy will be explained to the applicant and the preemployment consent and notice form will be signed by the applicant 3 should the applicant refuse to sign the consent form the application process will continue on the application it will be noted only that the applicant refused test it will not mention suspected alcohol or drug use by the applicant the applicant has the right to refuse to consent to the test but the city has the parallel right to refuse to hire the applicant 4 should an inquiry as to that specific application be made by the applicant or a third party at a later date the city must be sure to protect the confidentiality of the application process for instance if another employer contacts the city in the context of the reference check the only information that will be supplied is that the applicant did apply and that the applicant failed to meet the qualifications necessary for employment it will never be revealed that the applicant refused to consent to an alcoholcontrolled substances test 5 if the applicant being considered for a position consents to the test and the test results are negative the applicant will continue with the hiring process 6 should the test results be positive the test must be confirmed if the confirmatory test also indicates the presence of alcohol or controlled substances the applicant will be assumed to be in violation of this policy and will no longer be considered for employment inquiries to a specific application will be advised the applicant failed to meet the qualifications necessary for employment b the test upon reasonable suspicion 1 the test upon reasonable suspicion involves a great deal of discretion on the part of the supervisory personnel 2 the supervisor training program will provide precise guidelines as to what is involved with identifying a potential alcohol or controlled substance abuser the task of identifying potential abusers does not include diagnosing a worker the fact that a problem exists is all that is to be discussed when dealing with an employee 3 when it is suspected that an employee has violated the alcohol and controlled substance policy the employee will only be told that jobrelated problems have developed and that it is suspected that these jobrelated problems are the result of alcohol or controlled substance abuse the underlying cause of such abuse should not be a concern of the supervisor 4 the phrase reasonable suspicion means just thata screening test should be administered if it is reasonable to suspect that an employee has violated the policy a suspicion must be based upon objective indications of substance abuse or other policy violations 5 there are a few considerations to keep in mind before a test upon reasonable suspicion is administered thorough documentation of all steps of the investigation is a must this will include such items as 1 memos to the personnel file of the employee stating why a reasonable suspicion exists  2 notes placed in the file stating the date and time of any discussions with the employee regarding substance abuse and the employees reaction  and 3 documentation of any evidence suggesting alcohol or controlled substance abuse 6 in documenting the investigation every effort will be made to assure the confidentiality of the case 7 after it has been determined that a reasonable suspicion exists the next step is to actually test the employee for the presence of alcohol andor controlled substances 8 the employee will be called into a private office informed of the allegations of policy violation and be requested to sign the employee consent and notice form 9 if the employee refuses to consent to the testing heshe will be allowed to leave the office 10 if an employee consents to testing heshe always has the option of taking a blood test at hisher own expense this test must be under such circumstances to insure validity of the test 11 the supervisor should not touch the employee at any time or attempt to coerce the employee into consenting to the screening test 12 upon the employees refusal to consent heshe may be disciplined the employee may be terminated for insubordination pursuant to the procedure outlined in the personnel rules and regulations and the alcohol and controlled substance abuse policy 13 if the employee consents to the screening test and the confirmed results indicate the presence of alcohol or controlled substances in the employees system the employee will be assumed to be in violation of this policy and will be suspended without pay in accordance with this policy and the personnel rules and regulations 14 if it is determined that a violation of the policy has occurred the reasonable suspicion has been backed up by a positive confirmed screening test plus any other corroborating evidence of a violation the employee may be terminated or referred to the eap 15 as a practical matter the fact that the employees alcohol andor controlled substance abuse bad affected the employees work performance to the degree that a reasonable suspicion was developed in the first place should be considered when deciding whether to terminate the employee or refer himher to the eap in addition to the factors discussed earlier in this guide 16 if the investigation reveals that the employee has not violated the policy or if the evidence is ambiguous the employee will be reinstated with back pay c the testing following an accident of any employee which involves property damage or personal injury 1 at the time a person is employed by the city the alcohol and controlled substance policy will be explained to them along with city policies regarding accidents and the employee will sign the employee consent and notice form 2 at the time an employee is involved in an accident the employee will undergo a screen test 3 the department head or his designee will contact the department of personnel to arrange for the employee to be taken to a city designated physician medical facility or police department for testing 4 should the employee be injured the testing will be handled by medical personnel other than those treating the employee for injuries 5 should the test results be negative normal city policy and procedure in dealing with accidents will be followed 6 should the confirmed test results indicate the presence of alcohol or controlled substance the employee will be assumed to be in violation of this policy and may be disciplined in accordance with the alcohol and controlled substance policy and personnel rules and regulations 7 if there is sufficient cause to believe that a policy violation has occurred the employee may be either a terminated pursuant to the procedure set forth in the personnel rules and regulations  or b referred to the eap by hisher department director 8 if after the investigation has been completed it is determined that a policy violation has not occurred the employee will be reinstated with back pay to hisher former position and standard city policy in regard to accidents will be followed 9 the individuals refusal to sign the consent form at the time of employment may be grounds for nonhire attachment a d the random testing of safetysensitive positions of certified law enforcement officers firefighters life guards waterwaste water plant operators utility personnel handling gas service all city employees assigned or expected to operate a city owned vehicle on public routes and all operators of heavy equipment 1 the random testing of employees involves periodic testing of all persons authorized by the city to carry firearms or who are otherwise employed in safetysensitive positions the names of such employees will be drawn at random throughout the year a minimum of fifty 50 percent of the workforce will be tested annually 2 upon adoption of this policy all employees holding these safetysensitive positions will be requested to sign an employee consent and notice form 3 should the employee refuse to sign the consent form the employee will be disciplined following the procedure set forth in the city personnel policy 4 the employee may be terminated for insubordination pursuant to the procedure set forth in the personnel policy manual the stated reasons for terminating an employee will never be refusal to submit to urinalysis but rather insubordination or failure to follow the legitimate instructions of the supervisors or a reason of similar language 5 if the employee consents to the test and the test results are negative the employee can return to work 6 should the test results indicate the presence of alcohol or controlled substances that test result must and will be confirmed 7 if the confirmatory test also indicates the presence of alcoholcontrolled substances the employee will be assumed to be in violation of this policy and will be disciplined in accordance with the alcohol and controlled substance policy and personnel rules and regulations 8 an intensive investigation into the employees background and the circumstances behind the alleged policy violations will take place after investigation is completed and there is sufficient cause to believe that a policy violation has occurred the employee will be either a terminated pursuant to the procedures set forth in the personnel rules and regulations  or b referred to the eap by hisher department head or his designee 9 if after the investigation has been completed and it is determined that a policy violation has not occurred for example if the employee successfully rebuts the assumption of policy violations by requesting additional testing of the same urine samples or submitting to a blood test the results of which are negative the employee will be reinstated with back pay to hisher former position e testing following return to work after rehabilitation 1 this random testing of employees follows their return to work after voluntary or department head referral for rehabilitation services 2 at the time the employee enters into a rehabilitation program the department head or the department of personnel is notified immediately by the employee or their representative 3 upon release from a rehabilitation program the employee will be subject to random alcohol and controlled substance screening tests for a twelvemonth period 4 prior to returning to work the employee will be requested to sign an employee consent and notice form should the employee refuse to sign the consent form the employee will be disciplined following the procedures set forth in the city personnel policy manual 5 an investigation into the matter will be made following investigation heshe may be terminated for insubordination pursuant to the procedure set forth in the personnel policy manual the stated reasons for terminating an employee will never be refusal to submit to urinalysis but rather insubordination or failure to follow the legitimate instructions of the supervisors or a reason of similar language 6 if the employee consents to the test and the test results are negative the employee can return to work however should the test results indicate the presence of alcohol or controlled substances that test result must and will be confirmed 7 if the confirmatory test also indicates the presence of alcoholcontrolled substances the employee will be assumed to be in violation of this policy and will be disciplined in accordance with the alcohol and controlled substance policy and personnel rules and regulations 8 an intensive investigation into the employees background and the circumstances behind the alleged policy violations will take place after investigation is completed and there is sufficient cause to believe that a policy violation has occurred the employee will be terminated pursuant to the procedures set forth in the personnel rules and regulations 9 if after the investigation has been completed and it is determined that a policy violation has not occurred for example if the employee successfully rebuts the assumption of policy violations by requesting additional testing of the same urine samples or submitting to a blood test the results of which are negative the employee will be reinstated with back pay to hisher former position d other issues involving the policy 1 the duty to protect other employees and the public from impaired individuals if it is discovered that an employee is impaired while working the employee will not be allowed to drive home after the necessary disciplinary procedures have taken place the impaired employee should either be driven home or a taxi should be called for the employee if the employee is allowed to leave on his own in an obviously intoxicated state it is possible the city or the employees supervisors may be held legally liable for the actions of the employee 2 discipline generally the suspension or termination of an employee will never be justified on the basis that the employee is an alcoholic or substance abuser the employees physicalpsychological state of being will not be mentioned when disciplining that employee instead discipline will center around the employees failure to meet objective jobrelated criteria substandard performance insubordination violation of policy or failure to follow orders are examples of proper reasons for discipline supervisors are to rememberdont diagnose it describe it 3 employees right to privacy all meetings involving a violation of the alcohol and controlled substance policy should be on a closeddoor basis with admission restricted to those who have a legitimate interest in the proceedings under no circumstances will the proceedings be discussed outside of these closeddoor meetings nor will it ever be publicly stated that an employee is an alcoholic or controlled substance abuser after disciplinary proceedings have taken place inquires as to the reason for terminationsuspension will be answered with an objective cause only insubordination for example the use of alcohol or controlled substances shall not be publicly attributed to an employee  31604 alcohol and drug misuse prevention policy for pipeline employees a purpose the purpose of this policy is to prevent

analysis prepared by the city properly assesses and defines the citys fire protection program service delivery needs goals priorities as well as the city fire departments funding strategy for delivery

california which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the city  and based on the documentary evidence and oral testimony presented by citizens and an expert in economic development at a public hearing in which the mayor and council of the city participated in on   and based on documentary evidence submitted to the city council the city council takes note of the wellknown and selfevident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country it is the finding of the city council that public nudity either partial or total under certain circumstances particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or adult entertainment whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions in the same manner other adult businesses have the same deleterious effects on the community among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol commercial nudity in general and other adult businesses are disorderly conduct prostitution public solicitation public indecency drug use and drug trafficking among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol commercial nudity in general and other adult businesses are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood increased allocation of and expenditure of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described the city council finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the city as well the city council therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health welfare safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses neighborhoods and of churches schools residential areas public parks and playgrounds to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult business establishments therefore the city council finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult business establishment the city council finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests including but not limited to reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the

findings the mayor and city council make the following findings of fact 1 the city of perry is authorized by the georgia constitution of 198 including without limitation paragraph iii thereof and ocga  368262 to provide stormwater management services throughout the city of perry 2 in order to protect the health safety and welfare of the public the government of the city of perry hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund and establish rates for stormwater management services 3 in promulgating the regulations contained in this section the city of perry is acting pursuant to authority granted by the constitution of the state of georgia and the city charter of the city of perry to provide for stormwater collection and disposal 4 improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands threaten businesses and residences and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers streams and other bodies of water within the city of perry 5 a system for the collection conveyance storage treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city of perry and surrounding areas 6 the city of perry presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years the future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city and the additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city in order to do so the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainagerelated capital improvement needs 7 failure to effectively manage stormwater can adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the city of perry thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system 8 failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the further degradation of the water quality in area waterbodies which may result in higher levels o treatment requirements imposed on the city of perry wastewater treatment facilities and increased water treatment cost of potable water supplies by the city of perry 9 proper management of stormwater is a key element of having clean water with adequate assimilative capacity for treated wastewater discharges and adequate potable drinking water that are essential to support existing development as well as future development and redevelopment in the city of perry 10 the city will soon be required under federal and state regulations ie the citys national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes phase ii georgia notice of intent noi and stormwater permit effective  to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 and stormwater conveyance system into state of georgia or united states waters therefore it is appropriate for the city to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge directly or indirectly into the public ms4 and stormwater conveyance system whether the property is private or public in nature 11 compliance with the regulatory obligations of the npdes phase ii stormwater permit along with other city stormwater program activities will substantially increase the cost of providing stormwater management services above what is currently being spent for water quality management drainage system maintenance flood control and other program activities 12 the cost of operating and maintaining the city of perry stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs replacements improvements and extensions thereof should to the extent practicable be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system 13 the professional engineering and financing analysis known as the stormwater funding feasibility analysis including amendments and related documents dated february 2004 and prepared by the citys consulting stormwater engineer which report is incorporated herein by express reference properly assesses and defines the citys stormwater management program problems needs goals defines the citys stormwater management program funding strategy 14 given the stormwater management program problems needs goals priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater management systems within the city in concert with other water resource management programs 15 stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city while specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community 16 the stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protection of the public health safety and welfare of the community provision of stormwater management services renders andor results in both a service and a benefit to all properties property owners citizens and residents of the city in a variety of ways as described in the stormwater utility implementation report 17 the services and benefits rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management services may differ depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs and risk exposure it is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties impose on the citys stormwater management services which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof 18 a stormwater management program swmp provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services within the city user fee charges user fees and other mechanisms as described in the stormwater utility implementation report and the other related documents that have been prepared for the city by its consultants 19 a schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city such user fee charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs including but not limited to special service fees special assessments revenue bonds use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council 20 the existence of privately owned and maintained onsite or offsite systems facilities activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the citys swmp and the stormwater utilitys cost of providing stormwater management services andor stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit and such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services systems facilities activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility manager reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems facilities activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the property 21 the area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge 22 it is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services be dedicated solely to those purposes and such proceeds of user fee charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital operating and nonoperating costs

on common functional product or physical characteristics such as the type and amount of activity the type of customers or residents how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions the use classifications provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate districts use classifications describe one or more uses having similar characteristics but do not list every use or activity that may appropriately be within the classification b structure of this section 1 principal use characteristics and accessory uses the characteristics subsection describes common characteristics of each use category principal uses are assigned to the category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use also listed are examples of common accessory uses which unless otherwise stated in this chapter are allowed in conjunction with a principal use and are subject to the same regulations as the principal use 2 examples the examples subsection lists common examples of uses included in the respective use category the names of these sample uses are generic they are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself for example a use that calls itself wholesale sales but sells mostly to consumers is included in the retail sales and service category rather than the wholesale sales category this is because the activity on the site matches the characteristics of the retail sales and service category c developments with multiple principal uses when all principal uses of a development fall within one use category the entire development is assigned to that use category a development that contains a coffee shop bookstore and bakery for example would be classified in the retail sales and service category because all of the developments principal uses are in that category when the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to applicable regulations within that category developments with multiple principal uses such as shopping centers shall incorporate only those uses allowed in the underlying district d unlisted uses 1 procedure for approving unlisted uses where a particular use category or use type is not specifically listed in table 411 the administrator may permit the use category or type upon a finding that the criteria of subsection 421d2 are met the administrator shall give due consideration to the intent of this chapter concerning the districts involved the character of the uses specifically identified and the character of the use in question 2 criteria for approving unlisted uses in order to determine that the proposed use has an impact that is similar in nature function and duration to the other uses allowed in a specific district the administrator shall assess all relevant characteristics of the proposed use including but not limited to the following a the volume and type of sales retail wholesale  size and type of items sold and nature of inventory on the premises  b any processing done on the premises including assembly manufacturing

legislature of the state has in ocga  36120a delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the mayor and council of the city do hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations 2 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or substantial improvement  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 4 objectives the objectives of this article are a to protect human life and health  b to minimize expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects  c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d to minimize prolonged business interruptions  e to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines street and bridges located in floodplains  f to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  g to ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a potential flood area  and h comply with the requirements of the national flood insurance program nfip so as to ensure the availability of flood insurance for residents and property owners 5 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article includes methods and provisions for a restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  d controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or may increase flood hazards in other areas b general provisions 1 lands to which this article applies this article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard as designated by the city within the zoning and building code jurisdiction of the city 2 basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard the areas of special flood hazard identified by the federal emergency management agency in the flood insurance study fis or flood insurance rate maps firm dated  with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article the flood insurance study is on file at the administrator in addition the local administrator shall reasonably utilize any base flood evaluation and floodway data available from a federal state or other source in order to identify a special flood hazard not otherwise identified by the federal emergency management agency this data is also on file with the administrator 3 establishment of development permit a development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this article prior to the commencement of any development activities 4 compliance no structure or land shall hereafter be located extended converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations 5 abrogation and greater restrictions this article is not intended to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this article and another conflict or overlap whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail 6 interpretation in the interpretation and application of this article all provisions shall be a considered as minimum requirements  b liberally construed in favor of the governing body  and c deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes 7 warning and disclaimer of liability the

resource protection 731 purpose the intent of this article is to establish minimum development standards and criteria which will afford reasonable protection of environmentally sensitive natural resources found throughout the city it has been determined the wise management of these resources as defined in this section is essential to maintaining the health safety general welfare and economic wellbeing of the public 732 establishment of water resource districts the citys water resource districts shall include the following a groundwater recharge area district b wetlands protection district the boundaries of these water resource districts are shown on a set of maps designated as water resource districts and are included as part of the citys official zoning map which is on file with the administrator 733 definitions in addition to the general definitions provided in this article the following definitions shall apply to this section aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well drastic means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in the us environmental protection agency document epa60087035 note the drastic methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility generalized wetlands map means the current us fish and wildlife service national wetlands inventory maps for the city of perry georgia jurisdictional wetland means an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the us army corps of engineers jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the us army corps of engineers as required by of the clean water act 33 usc  134 as amended pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills discharges leaks impoundments applications of chemicals injections and other human activities in the recharge area pollution susceptibility map means the relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources using the drastic methodology georgia department of natural resources hydrologic atlas 20 groundwater pollution susceptibility map of georgia recharge area means any portion of the earths surface where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer regulated activity means any activity which will or which may reasonably be expected to result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the us excepting those activities exempted in of the federal clean water act significant recharge areas mean those areas mapped by the georgia department of natural resources in hydrologic atlas 18 1989 edition water resource districts mean a map overlay which imposes a set of requirements in addition to those of the underlying zoning district wetlands means those areas inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support and under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions wetlands generally include swamps marshes bogs and similar areas the ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils hydrological vegetation and hydrological conditions involving a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation 734 groundwater recharge area district a findings of fact recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities pesticides herbicides animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies b purpose the purpose of this overlay district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills discharges leaks impoundments application of chemicals injections and other development pressures c district delineation the groundwater recharge area district is delineated according to the georgia department of natural resources most significant groundwater recharge areas of georgia hydrologic atlas 18 1989 edition each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high medium or
