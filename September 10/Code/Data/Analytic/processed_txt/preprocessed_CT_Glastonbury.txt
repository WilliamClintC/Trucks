irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the state have been endowed the wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web of nature essential to an adequate supply of surface and underground water  to hydrological stability and control of flooding and erosion  to the recharging and purification of groundwater  and to the existence of many forms of animal aquatic and plant life many inland wetlands and watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger of destruction because of unregulated use by reason of the deposition filling or removal of material the diversion or obstruction of water flow the erection of structures and other uses all of which have despoiled polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses such unregulated activity has had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on the environment and ecology of the state of connecticut and has and will continue to imperil the quality of the environment thus adversely affecting the ecological scenic historic and recreational values and benefits of the state for its citizens now and forever more the preservation and protection of the wetlands and watercourses from random unnecessary undesirable and unregulated uses disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the health welfare and safety of the citizens of the state it is therefore the purpose of these regulations to protect the citizens of the state by making provisions for the protection preservation maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and watercourses by  minimizing their disturbance and pollution   maintaining and improving water quality in accordance with the highest standards set by federal state or local authority   preventing damage from erosion turbidity or siltation   preventing loss of fish and other beneficial aquatic organisms wildlife and vegetation and the destruction of the natural habitats thereof   deterring and inhibiting the danger of flood and pollution   protecting the quality of wetlands and watercourses for their conservation economic aesthetic recreational and other public and private uses and values  and  protecting the states potable fresh water supplies from the dangers of drought overdraft pollution misuse and mismanagement  all by providing an orderly process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state and the use of its land with the need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people of the state the safety of such natural resources for their benefit and enjoyment

united states department of agriculture soil conservation service storrs 1 connecticut september 1972 prior to adoption of these regulations such upland review areas were previously regulated under of the town of glastonbury building zone regulations effective date of  as amended  but said was repealed after such areas became regulated under the inland wetlands and watercourses regulations town of glastonbury connecticut adopted in 1989 furthermore this upland review area concept was acknowledged by the state of connecticut department of environmental protection as referenced in their june 1997 publication guidelines for upland review area regulations under connecticut inland wetlands and watercourses act which establishes that the relationship between a wetland or watercourse and its surrounding upland is complex and that certain activities in upland review areas affect wetlands and watercourses as established in the definition for the upland review area in of these regulations said upland review area extends onehundred fifty 150 feet beyond the boundary of the wetland or watercourse within targeted watershed boundaries and subwatersheds of special concern and along the main stems of targeted watercourses of special concern that are identified in the town of glastonbury  and extends onehundred feet beyond the boundary of the wetland or watercourse within all other areas in the town of glastonbury b the design goal for ten 10 percent or less of effective impervious surface coverage on a land use proposal i a review of scientific literature indicates that once a watershed areas impervious coverage exceeds ten percent the watercourse including water quality degrades to a point where environmentally engineered mitigation measures cannot restore the degraded watercourse applications for land use proposals which exceed the ten percent goal and which are located in whole or in part within the targeted watersheds of special concern identified in must involve a determination of whether the effective impervious surface area will likely result in an adverse impact to the wetlands or watercourses definitions 21 as used in these regulations act means the
