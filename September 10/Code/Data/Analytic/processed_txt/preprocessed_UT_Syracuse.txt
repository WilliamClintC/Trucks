working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota and statistics obtained from the us department of health and human services centers for disease control and prevention the city council finds that 1sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2crime statistics show that all types of crimes especially sex related crimes occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located 3sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4offering and providing such booths andor cubicles encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7as of june 200 the total number of reported cases of aids in the united states caused by the immunodeficiency virus hiv was 793025 8the total number of cases of genital chlamydia trachomatis infections in the united states reported in 2000 was 702093 a six percent increase over the year 1999 9the total number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported during the 12year period 19962000 was 212672 10the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with a total of 1730911 cases reported during the period 19962000 11the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug use exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 12according to the best scientific evidence available aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 13sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 14numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids including semen and urine are found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 15nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution increases sexual assaults and attracts other criminal activity 16nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of drug dealing and drug use 17alcohol consumption in adult establishments increases the likelihood of crime illegal drug use and illegal sexual activity and encourages undesirable behavior that is not in the interest of the public health safety and welfare 18the findings noted in subsections b1 b17 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns 19sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 20a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses further such licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 21removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments 22the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity 23it is desirable in the prevention of crime and the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 24the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this chapter 25the barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of five years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to further criminal conduct and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 26the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by enactment of this chapter 27when more than one sexually oriented business use occupies the same location or business address the secondary effects caused by such businesses are increased secondary effects are eliminated or controlled to a greater degree when only a single sexually oriented business use is allowed to occupy the same location exh a    application of provisions this chapter imposes regulatory standards and license requirements on certain business activities which are characterized as sexually oriented businesses and certain employees of those businesses characterized as sexually oriented business employees except where the context or specific provisions require this chapter does not supersede or nullify any other related ordinances including but not limited to those codified in other chapters

safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage exh a    purpose it is the purpose of this chapter

architectural review committee arc commercial professional office and public facility developments building design site design industrial developments industrial site planning industrial architecture industrial landscape design  purpose athe purpose of the design standards outlined in this chapter is to facilitate exceptional design in the built environment and preserve the quality of life within syracuse city this chapter is based on the following principles 1higher quality designs will bring value to the commercial community of syracuse and attract businesses which positively contribute to the overall quality of life and wellbeing of syracuse residents 2syracuse welcomes a variety of businesses and recognizes that brand recognition has become an important aspect of developing a successful and competitive business the design standards enumerated in this chapter are intended to help and encourage development of imaginative and unique design solutions which meet business needs while at the same time preserving syracuses unique history and community identity 3this chapter supplements the objectives of other chapters in this title which also impose certain design standards or requirements that are zone specific bthis chapter references design standards and design guidelines they are intended to improve the quality and compatibility of development particularly with regard to building design and site design 1design standards design standards are required in addition to other standards set forth in this title design standards are intended to ensure quality development and permanence in design the implementation of these standards ensures that the goals and values of the community are reflected in each commercial development and contribute positively to the overall built environment 2design guidelines design guidelines offer examples to clarify and explain design standards they are made available for public use and distribution within a separate manual that can be found on record in the community development department the purpose of the syracuse city commercial design standards and guidelines manual is to better clarify the relationship between design standards and guidelines the design guidelines serve to graphically represent the design standards and are used as a reference tool in order to better illustrate the application of the design standards   architectural review committee arc the arc is established to review all applicable development plans for compliance with the design standards in this chapter this committee functions as a subcommittee of the planning commission and consists of seven members appointed by the mayor with the advice and consent of the city council in accordance with the syracuse municipal consist of community residents planning commissioners maximum two and city staff the planning commission chair may recommend candidates for the mayors consideration the arc is responsible to review the plan elevations architectural details and development design pattern book and make recommendations to the planning commission consistent with this chapter the planning commission will in turn submit their recommendations to the city council   commercial professional office and public facility developments aapplicability the design standards set forth in scc  and  apply to 1all new commercial professional office or public facilities buildings and uses except where the requirements of this chapter are superseded by another provision of this title 2existing commercial professional office or

chapter apply in addition to other applicable requirements of this title   building design acontext all building designs are required to be drafted with sensitivity to the design of nearby buildings and developments this sensitivity includes considering whether 1buildings contribute to the overall character of syracuse and the neighborhood  2buildings reflect the character of surrounding development of some similar features  3buildings demonstrate imaginative design  and 4buildings vary colors materials or architectural elements where proposed building designs closely copy or mirror surrounding developments bentrances all building entrances are required to be clearly articulated to indicate a transition from the exterior to the interior of the building every main entrance is required to have a special emphasis when compared to the other portions of the building this is accomplished use of at least three of the following near entrances 1a prominent architectural feature that is unique to the overall building design  2complimentary yet differing building materials or colors  3increased use of windows or glass  4pedestrian amenities that may include patios porches special paving treatments seating areas or awnings  or 5increased landscaping cfacade articulation buildings designed with completely flat facades and monotone color schemes are not permitted all buildings are required to have articulation of all facades 1horizontal or vertical facade variations must occur at least every 30 feet or along a minimum of 60 percent of the horizontal length of buildings with facades 100 feet or greater this is accomplished by using methods such as avariation in the surface plane that may include popouts bays and recesses  bvariation in the surface pattern such as arches banding and paneling  or cdistinguished treatment of windows doors and eaves that may include molding or framing 2buildings with facades 100 feet or greater in total length must have at least one significant facade variation from the primary wall plane whose depth is at least five percent of the total facade length and whose width is at least 20 percent of the total facade length uninterrupted facades 100 feet or greater in length are prohibited dheight and roofline all building roof heights will be compatible with the buildings location and varied roofline elevations or parapets are required in order to add architectural interest and avoid the appearance or sense of monotonous roofline expanses all buildings are required to 1have appropriate roof height for the location based on zoning regulations and the height of buildings within the immediate area  2have roofline and parapet variations where there are long continuous and undisturbed rooflines 50 feet in length or greater  3use similar materials and colors on the back of false fronts parapets cornices or other parts of the building which extend beyond the roofline or main building so that the building appears cohesive from all views  and 4have screening of mechanical equipment and systems that will be mounted on the roof any portion of these pieces of equipment that is not fully shielded is required to be painted a color which is compatible with the roofing or parapet materials emassing proper massing reduces the impact of the massive bulk created by large buildings that may not otherwise relate in scale to surrounding development vertical articulation horizontal articulation and multiplaned roof or awnings must be used in designs to mitigate the impact on surrounding development and the overall landscape fmaterials quality longlasting materials are required for all buildings in order to contribute to the aesthetics of the community over the long term 1a minimum of

agreement design pattern books are subject to the following 1written descriptions with graphic illustrations explaining how the development complements the physical form of the property and how the theme and standards found in this chapter are to be integrated into the design of the development  2written descriptions with graphic illustrations explaining the proposed conceptual architectural design building elevations and other such related design schemes  and 3written descriptions with graphic illustrations that clearly describe proposed open spaces landscaping ideas pedestrian pathways furnishings lighting and related entryway features andor amenities hpedestrians all buildings will be designed with an integral focus on encouraging pedestrian activity and social interaction additionally buildings that contain more than one story or that are above 20 feet in height are required to provide a clearly articulated and more detailed base that relates to pedestrians isigns signs located on any building facade are required to be compatible with the buildings overall design as an integral design element signs are required to be compatible with the style of the buildings in terms of location scale color and lettering 1the locations for signs on a buildings facade will be planned for as part of the buildings overall design 2signs located on facades should integrate similar or complementary materials as the building jwindows windows are key to the overall design of a building and the relationship between the exterior and interior the majority of windows are required to relate to the scale of a person 1windows should be at eye level 2where buildings are adjacent to pedestrian walkways transparent windows must relate the scale of the building and the buildings interior to pedestrians where transparent windows may not be desirable tinted windows false windows or glass block are allowed 3window awnings are an effective way to add detail and variation to a building emphasize pedestrian scale windows and create an exciting and inviting environment when placing awnings ause quality materials which are durable and are able to withstand extremes in the weather  bcolors should be complementary to the color of the building on which the awning is located  and cstyles should be compatible with the architectural features and overall
