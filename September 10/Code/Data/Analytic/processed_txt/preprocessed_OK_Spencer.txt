promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure the potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area   a 4141988 findings of fact the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage   a 4141988 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes these regulations are established to 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging

detention pond location elevations and dimensions 14 detention storage calculations with inflow and outflow hydrographs    determination of storm runoff a general 1 numerous methods of runoff computation are available on which the design of storm drainage and flood control systems may be based the rational method will be accepted as adequate for drainage areas up to 500 acres for larger areas other methods may be used 2 the methodology developed by the us geological survey titled techniques for estimating flood discharges for oklahoma streams will be acceptable as adequate for drainage basins in excess of 500 acres other hydrographic models or methods suitable for this are also acceptable hydrographic techniques for determining the size of small detention facilities are included under section 44716 3 the rational method is based on the following assumptions a the peak rate of runoff at any point is a direct function of the average rainfall intensity during the time of concentration to that point b the frequency of the peak discharge is the same as the frequency of the average rainfall intensity c the time of concentration is the time required for the runoff to become established and flow from the most remote part of the drainage area to the point under design the latter assumption applies to the part most remote in time not necessarily in distance in the rational method average intensities have no time sequence relation to the actual rainfall pattern during the storm the intensityduration curve is not a time sequence b rational method of runoff computation 1 runoff coefficient c a it should be noted that the runoff coefficient c is the variable of the rational method which is least susceptible to precise determination its use in the formula implies a fixed ratio for any given drainage area which in reality is not the case a reasonable coefficient must be chosen to represent the integrated effects of infiltration detention storage evaporation retention flow routing and interception all of these affect the time distribution and peak rate of runoff b recommended ranges for c values are as follows basin slope less than 2 percent more than 2 percent singlefamily residence 070 070 multifamily 075 075 apartments 085 085 commercialindustrial 095 095 parks  golf courses 050 050 undeveloped pasture and cultivated 050 050 2 rainfall intensity a rainfall intensity is the average rainfall rate in inches per hour which is considered for a particular drainage basin or subbasin and is selected based on design rainfall duration and design frequency of occurrence the design duration is equal to the time of concentration for the drainage area under consideration intensity duration curves for this region are shown on a of techniques for estimating flood discharges for oklahoma streams b the time of concentration used in the rational equation is the critical time of concentration for the point of interest the critical time of concentration is the time associated with the peak runoff from the watershed to the point of interest the time of concentration to any point in a storm drainage system is a combination of the inlet time and the time of flow in the conduit street flow shall be considered as being in an open paved channel mannings equation is acceptable for determining open channel and free water surface

flows and open channel andor swale routings are the preferred alignments of the components of residential drainage systems within the city these drainage flow techniques assist in the control of stormwater runoff in that the time of concentration of runoff can be extended specific reduction in the amount of runoff contributed from each new development in the upper and middle reaches of a drainage basin can reduce the cumulative runoff impact of development thereby contributing to reduction of hazards andor reduction in the need for costly supplemental systems in the downstream areas open channel flows are not necessarily natural systems although they rely heavily on existing natural features and qualities of the development site 2 virtually all development increases the amount of stormwater that becomes runoff during and after an event because of the impervious surfaces used in development increases in runoff which change the equilibrium of natural areas in the system mandate specific engineering solutions to conserve these natural systems and the predevelopment characteristics of the area the creation of swales alteration of small channel capacity or direction changing of

two generalized types of storm runoff storage that can be used to control flooding the term retention storage refers to storm runoff collected and stored for a significant period and released or used after the storm runoff has ended the term detention storage consists of reducing the rate of runoff for a short period of time to reduce peak flows by controlling the discharge outlet structure and by extending the period of runoff the purpose of storage of stormwater is to prevent excess runoff from attaining flow rates that exceed the capacities of downstream drainage systems unless every available location for stormwater storage is utilized the management of stormwater runoff by means of storage will not be successful the ideal design begins the storing of runoff as close as possible to the ridgelines that divide and subdivide the watershed to extend the time of concentration runoff storage may be accomplished by the storage of water in reservoirs parks side channels detention ponds either on or off site detention facilities shall be provided prior to general earthwork on the site or construction of buildings and parking lots 2 stormwater detention ponds shall be required where proposed development will be increasing the quantity of stormwater runoff however in the event a complete hydrology study by a licensed professional engineer indicates that less flooding damage will occur without stormwater detention and the floodwater elevations do not increase the detention requirement may be waived possible areas where this waiver may apply are at lower areas of drainage basins or areas where the confluence of other streams are creating a rise in water elevation and the timing of an earlier release may be less detrimental to a flooding problem b rainfall storage 1 rooftop storage will not be permitted 2 parking lot storage if used may employ ponding areas with throttled drains or gravel filled pits with french drains 3 property line swale ponding and small on
