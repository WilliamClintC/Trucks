1902 findings of fact the village board of trustees finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature 2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants 3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads 4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading 5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities 6 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes 7 undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding 1903 purpose and intent 1 purpose the general purpose of this ordinance is to establish longterm postconstruction

only to parcels within the village credits to user fees will only be allowed when it can be demonstrated by the customer that a condition or activity on the property results in a direct reduction in costs for storm water utility services those conditions and activities are specified in this policy document 2 credit structure for the purposes of generating applicable credit rates the municipal storm water management services which are funded user fee are divided into three categories storm water base fee 30% storm water flow fee 35% storm water quality fee 35% a fees to support the storm water base programs are applied throughout the utility customer base and credits are not allowed for these components the storm water base costs are required to conduct the storm water management program throughout the village b only the costs associated with the storm water flow and storm water quality fees are eligible for a credit these costs are associated with the utilitys efforts to

andor storm water quality components may be eligible for a portion or all of these credits c the tasks included under each category and the percent credit for each category under this policy may be reviewed and modified on an asneeded basis modifications must be approved by village board resolution 3 credit criteria a properties that exceed village storm water management ordinance flow control requirements this credit applies to all properties that provide privately constructed and maintained runoff flow control measures properties that implement flow control management practices so as to exceed village of north fond du lacs storm water management standards may be eligible for a credit the utility customer must submit documentation demonstrating that a management practice on their property exceeds the peak flow reduction criteria to the department of public works dpw the amount of credit will be based on the prorated amount that the property is 30 exceeding the requirements the acceptable methodologies for computing the peak flow are described in 19073b see 19184 for submittal requirements the amount of storm water flow fee credit will be based on the following criteria 1 postdevelopment flow from all three design storms as defined in 19073b meet the minimum requirements 2 property must reduce the peak flow requirement of the 10year design storm below the required rate as defined by the village storm water management ordinance all calculations shall use the 10year 24hour scs type ii distribution rainstorm of 39 inches in 24 hours the credit amount will be based on the percentage the property exceeds the minimum flow control requirements an example of credit calculations is provided in the following table example storm water flow fee credit calculations reduce flow below the requirement by 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% multiply by 35% maximum eligible credit 35% 35% 35% 35% 35% 35% the utility fee credit will be 0% 7% 14% 21% 28% 35% b properties that implement storm water quality practices this credit applies to all properties that provide privately constructed and maintained runoff pollution control measures properties that implement pollution control management practices so as to reduce storm water sediment total suspended solids below the requirements of the villages storm water management be eligible for a credit the utility customer must submit

fee credit calculations for a new development parcel required to reduce sediment by 80% parcel reduces sediment pollution by 80% 85% 90% 95% multiply 35% maximum eligible credit by 0% 5% 10% 15% the utility fee credit will be 0% 9% 18% 27%  credit prorated based on the percent sediment control remaining after the minimum requirement is met  column does not exceed minimum requirement of village ordinance thus no storm water utility credit is applied 2 for existing developed properties with no pollution control requirements the credit will be based directly on the percent sediment control achieved compared to the property under the premanagement condition in no case will the credit exceed 35% for example if an existing developed property installs a storm water pollution management measure that reduces sediment pollution from the property by 20% the property shall be eligible for a 20% credit 31 c riparian properties properties that discharge storm water from all or a portion of their property directly into lake winnebago without entering a village of north fond du lac municipally owned storm water conveyance system may be eligible for a credit the credit amount will be
