 methods of reducing flood losses  definitions  general provisions  administration  provisions for flood hazard reduction  penalties for noncompliance  findings athe flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage   statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to aprotect human life and health  bminimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  cminimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  dminimize prolonged business interruptions  eminimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  streets and bridges located in floodplains  fhelp maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and gensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area   methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods arestrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  dcontrol filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  eprevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands   definitions unless

design standards adopted by the city ccpted crime prevention through environmental design principles the developer is required to consider the basic principles of cpted when designing the site plan landscape plan and architectural design for a project use of the cpted principles is strongly encouraged in the interest of the future security of the project from both the owners as well as the customers standpoint the concept of cpted is based upon the theory that the proper design and effective use of the built environment can lead to the reduction in the incidence and fear of crime and be an improvement in the quality of life the following principles should be taken into account in the design of all buildings and developments 1natural surveillance physical design that keeps potential intruders under the perception of continual watch using eyes on the street eg view to streets driveways and parking lots and visual permeability in architecture lighting and landscaping 2natural access control physical design that guides the mobility of people and decreases crime opportunity and increases perception of risk to potential offenders 3territorial reinforcement physical design that encourages users of property to develop ownership over it developing space with an easily discernable purpose using symbolic barriers such as low lying fenceswalls landscaping and signage eliminating ambiguous spaces encouraging easy maintenance and discouraging crime 4management and maintenance responsibility for managing and maintaining the property show that someone cares about seeing that the property is in a presentable appearance and is secure for the customers that use the facility 5cpted landscaping standards these should be used including planting shrubs with a maximum height of two feet 2 to three feet 3 and trees with proper ground clearance of seven feet 7 above walkways and sidewalks and fourteen feet 14 above vehicular travel and parking lanes this shall be accomplished pruning practices not by clear cutting topping trees or other pruning for exposure techniques 6public safety in order to encourage public safety surveillance natural access control and

administrative officials have specialized knowledge in the field of planning and land use and are charged with and are experienced in implementing the goals and policies of the community as adopted by and under the supervision of elected representatives of the public accordingly they should be allowed a comparatively wide latitude of discretion  and their actions endowed with a presumption of correctness and validity which an appeal authority should not interfere with unless it is shown that there is no reasonable basis to justify the action taken and that therefore the determinations made were so unreasonable as to be arbitrary and capricious it is not the appeal authoritys prerogative to substitute its judgment for that of the land use authority where the record discloses a reasonable basis for the land use authoritys determinations 3conditional use permits the standard of review for appeals concerning administrative and nonadministrative conditional use permits is set forth in the administrative and nonadministrative conditional use permit chapter of this scope of authority only those decisions in which a land use authority has applied a land use ordinance to a particular

writing or entity desiring a waiver or modification of the requirements of the land use ordinance as applied to a parcel of property that he owns leases or in which he holds some other beneficial interest may apply to the appeal authority for a variance from the terms of the land use ordinance bstandards for variances 1a variance may only be granted if aliteral enforcement of the land use ordinance would cause an unreasonable hardship for the applicant that is not necessary to carry out the general purpose of the land use ordinances  and bthere are special circumstances attached to the property that do not generally apply to other properties in the same zone district  and cgranting the variance is essential to the enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other properties in the same zone district  and dthe variance will not substantially affect the general plan and will not be contrary to the public interest  and ethe spirit of the land use ordinance is observed and substantial justice done 2in determining whether or not enforcement of the land use ordinance would cause unreasonable hardship under subsection b1 of this section the appeal authority may not find an unreasonable hardship unless the alleged hardship ais located on or associated with the property for which the variance is sought  and bcomes from circumstances peculiar to the property and not from conditions that are general to the neighborhood  and cis not selfimposed or economic a hardship inflicted on a property by action of a previous owner is considered to be self imposed and shall not be reason for granting a variance to the current owner 3in determining whether or not there are special circumstances attached to the property under subsection b1 of this section the appeal authority may find that special circumstances exist only if the special circumstances arelate to the hardship complained of  and bdeprive the property of privileges granted to other properties in the same zone district cburden of proof the applicant shall bear the burden of proving that all of the conditions justifying a variance have been met deffect variances run with the land euse variances not allowed the appeal authority may not grant use variances fimposing additional requirements in granting a variance the appeal authority may impose additional requirements on the applicant that will 1mitigate any harmful effects of the variance  or 2serve the purpose of the standard or requirement that is waived or modified   district court review of decision aany person

methods of reducing flood losses  definitions  general provisions  administration  provisions for flood hazard reduction  penalties for noncompliance  findings athe flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise
