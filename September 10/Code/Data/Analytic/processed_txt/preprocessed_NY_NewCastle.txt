in the best interests of the taxpayers to facilitate the acquisition of goods and services of maximum quality at the lowest price possible under the circumstances and to guard against favoritism extravagance fraud and corruption c the board finds further that while the lowest responsible bidder has been the historically accepted method of awarding such contracts the lowest responsible bidder may not offer the most costeffective or efficient option over time even if the expenditure is higher considering the total value of the life of the procurement may result in a better value and longterm investment of public funds best value procurement also encourages competition and in turn often results in better pricing quality and customer service fostering healthy competition ensures that bidders will continue to strive for excellence in identifying and meeting the towns needs best value procurement will provide flexibility in obtaining important goods and services at favorable prices and will reduce the time to procure such goods and services a a purchase contract shall be awarded on the basis of lowest responsible bidder unless the applicable town department head prepares a written specification prior to publication of the request for proposals  113 new castle town code  23   24 evaluation criteria providing reasons why it is in the best interests of the town of new

to the rating of bids or offers a goods and services procured and awarded on the basis of best value are those that the town determines will be of the highest quality while being the most costefficient as offered by responsive and responsible bidders and offerors the determination of quality and cost efficiency shall be based on objectively quantified and clearly described and documented criteria b evaluation criteria to be considered in the award of a purchase contract on the basis of best value include but are not limited to 1 the need for the costlier option as compared

the town of new castle became the first municipality in the state of new york to adopt the new york state department of environmental conservations climate smart communities pledge a tenmeasure commitment to encourage renewable energy to increase  5310 new castle town code  541   542 definitions for purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply recycling efforts and to incorporate climate change sustainability and the use of environmentally sound goods and services within all development plans in april 2011 the town board adopted a climate action plan b in accordance with the goals and objectives of the climate smart communities pledge and the towns climate action plan the town board seeks to conserve resources reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions waste litter and pollution an important part of that goal is to procure and use sustainable products and services c the town board finds that the use of singleuse carryout bags plastic paper and biodegradable has negative environmental impacts including ghg emissions litter water consumption solid waste generation and effects on wildlife and that numerous studies have documented the prevalence of singleuse carryout bags littering the environment blocking storm drains and fouling beaches singleuse plastic bags do not biodegrade but instead break down into smaller pieces that are ingested by marine animals and make their way into the food chain furthermore the manufacturing transport recycling and or disposal of paper bags require significant environmental resources d the town board believes that from an overall environmental and economic perspective a shift to reusable bags is a better alternative to the continued use of singleuse plastic and paper carryout bags similar policies adopted in other jurisdictions have resulted in significant reductions in the use of singleuse carryout bags the town board finds that such a shift in use shall be a benefit to the overall health safety and welfare of the town of new castle its residents and the local environment e the town board also finds that a carryout bag fee is an essential element of the movement away from singleuse carryout bags because it will discourage customers from using singleuse carryout bags when shopping at regulated stores and will encourage a shift towards the use of reusable bags any costs incurred by applicable businesses as defined herein in providing paper bags and reusable bags will be at least partially offset by the monetary proceeds from the carryout bag fee furthermore such fee is not a tax because the monetary proceeds will be retained by the retail establishments and this chapter shall not specify how the retailers must expend the monies collected f therefore for the foregoing reasons the town board has decided to adopt a new chapter of the town to limit and discourage the use of disposable singleuse carryout bags and incentivize the use of reusable carryout bags

provide greater protection for the regions water resources the overlay district to be established for the eastern end of town is entirely located in the croton and kensico watersheds part of the new york city water supply system the overlay district to be established for the western end of the town contains the majority of watershed lands that surround the indian brook reservoir  the principal drinking water source for the village and town of ossining in addition the western end of the town drains into the hudson river watershed a major recreational and important fisheries resource for the region  639 new castle town code  642   643 purpose c the eastern and western ends of the town contain a significant amount of wetland resources nine of the 18 new york state department of environmental conservation designated wetlands within new castle are located within the environmental protection overlay districts to be established for the eastern and western ends of the town of particular significance is that the state wetlands at both ends of the town form extensive linear corridors that are connected hydrologically via watercourses and often are flanked by steep slopes a substantial percentage of the properties in both the eastern and western ends of the town contain state and locally designated wetlands as well as slopes in the 15  25% range the unique combination of steep slopes and adjacent wetland systems contribute greatly to the environmental sensitivity of both ends of the town the town board finds that preservation protection and conservation of these resources is a public policy of the town a in order to protect maintain and enhance both the immediate and longterm health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the town of new castle the environmental protection overlay regulations impose special controls over land development located in areas that have been determined to be environmentally sensitive within the town of new castle these regulations are designed to enhance the preservation and protection of wetlands located within the town as invaluable natural resources that provide for flood protection wildlife habitat recreation and open space erosion and pollution control and recharging of ground water supplies by 1 increasing the size of protected wetland buffers which play a critical role in maintaining water quality functions providing important transitional habitat for wildlife and filtering out nonpoint pollution sources the proximity of wetlands to steep slopes makes protection of the buffer area even more critical due to the underlying soils that may exhibit severe soil erosion characteristics increased runoff potential and the need for greater undisturbed distances upslope to support resident endemic wildlife populations 2 regulating small wetland areas below 110th of an acre that may play a critical role in providing the only available habitat for environmentally sensitive species that depend upon wetlands for part of their life cycle especially vernal areas that tend to be very small often isolated and seasonal wetland habitats 3 adopting a specific wetlands assessment model for performing wetlands functional analyses for all development projects that involve wetland impacts in order to protect and safeguard the values and functions of the wetland systems and provide consistency in review methods and analysis the eastern and western ends of the town consist of extensive linear wetland  642 general provisions  643   644 definitions words or phrases used in this

policy of the town to preserve protect and conserve its steep slopes so as to maintain and protect the natural terrain and its vegetative features preserve wetlands water bodies and watercourses prevent flooding protect important scenic views and vistas preserve areas of wildlife habitat provide safe building sites and protect adjoining property by preventing surface erosion creep and sudden slope failure in this connection the town board finds as follows a protection of steep slopes is a matter of concern to the entire town the establishment of regulatory and conservation practices to prevent disturbance of steep slopes is needed to protect the public health safety and general welfare experience has demonstrated a need for effective protection of steep slopes including careful review and regulation and the implementation of stringent mitigation measures where in the opinion of the approving authority no practicable alternative to such disturbance exists however in all cases where the approving authority determines that total avoidance of steep slopes is not practicable such disturbance should constitute the minimum disturbance necessary to ensure the property owner a reasonable use of his property b the improperly managed disturbance of steep slopes can aggravate erosion and sedimentation beyond rates experienced in natural geomorphological processes erosion and sedimentation often include the loss of topsoil a valuable natural resource and can result in the disturbance of habitats degradation of the quality of surface water alteration of drainage patterns the gullying of land obstruction of drainage structures and intensification of flooding both on and off the subject site c the inadequately controlled disturbance of steep slopes can lead to the failure of slopes and the mass movement of earth  danger to the natural environment manmade structures and the safety of persons  and the degradation of aesthetics d steep slopes including vegetation and rock outcroppings located thereon are important environmental features that contribute significantly to the visual impression one forms while traveling castle areas that are highly visible from

chapter shall be known and may be cited as the stormwater management and erosion and sediment control local law of the town of new castle  108a2 findings of fact it is hereby determined that a land development activities and associated increases in siteimpervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  c clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation  e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow  f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the town   10815 general provisions  108a2   108a3 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public and to address the findings of fact in  108a2 hereof this chapter seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives g stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  h the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety i regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development 1 meet the

provisions  11337  tattooing  1141 findings the town board has noted that  26021 of the penal law provides that it is a misdemeanor to mark the body of a child less than 18 years old with indelible ink or pigments by means of tattooing it is also the experience of the town of new castle police department that prohibitions of certain activities based solely on age prove difficult and impractical to enforce and that the town lacks the resources and personnel to properly supervise these age limited activities in addition there is evidence that the practice of tattooing when improperly done and state guidelines are not followed can create health risks particularly of serum hepatitis however the town lacks the resources to implement and staff an effective regulatory scheme of licensing and inspection of tattoo establishments accordingly the town board finds that in this town the enforcement of the abovereferenced provision of the penal law is difficult and impractical and the town cannot effectively license and monitor tattoo establishments therefore as a means to protect the public the town finds it necessary to impose a ban on this commercial activity  1142 prohibited activities  exceptions it shall be unlawful for any person to tattoo a human being within the town of new castle for pay or compensation of any kind except that tattooing may be performed for medical purposes by a person licensed or otherwise authorized pursuant to the education law to practice medicine or osteopathy  1143 penalties for offenses an offense against the provisions of this chapter shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding $350 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months or both for conviction of a first offense  for conviction of a second offense both of which were

subsequent offense all of which were committed within a period of five years punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than $1000 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months or both

findings  purpose a the town board of the town of new castle finds and declares it to be the public policy of the town to preserve protect and conserve its wetlands including water bodies and watercourses and the benefits derived therefrom to prevent despoliation and destruction and to regulate the use and development thereof and to secure the natural benefits of wetlands water bodies and watercourses consistent with the general welfare and beneficial economic and social development of the town in this connection the town board finds as follows 1 rapid population growth attended by housing road and other construction and increasing demands upon natural resources are found to be encroaching upon despoiling polluting or eliminating many of the towns wetlands water bodies watercourses and other natural resources and processes associated therewith 2 the preservation and maintenance of wetlands water bodies and watercourses in an undisturbed and natural condition constitute important physical ecological social aesthetic recreational and economic assets necessary to promote the health safety and general welfare of present and future residents of the town and of downstream drainage areas in particular wetlands serve multiple functions including a protecting water resources by providing sources of surface water recharging groundwater and aquifers serving as chemical and biological oxidation basins and functioning as settling basins for naturally occurring sedimentation b controlling flooding and stormwater runoff by storing or regulating natural flows c providing nesting migratory and wintering habitats for diverse wildlife species including many on the new york state and federal endangered species lists  1364 new castle town code  1371   1372

for nitrogen and phosphorus and filters for surface water pollutants h helping to maintain biospheric stability by supporting particularly efficient photosynthesizers capable of producing significant amounts of oxygen and supporting bacteria that process excess nitrates and nitrogenous pollutants and return them to the atmosphere as inert nitrogen gas i providing open space and visual relief from development j serving as outdoor laboratories and living classrooms for the study and appreciation of natural history ecology and biology 3 considerable acreage of these important natural resources has been lost or impaired by draining dredging filling excavating building polluting and other acts inconsistent with the natural uses of such areas remaining wetlands are in jeopardy of being lost
