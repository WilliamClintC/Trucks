ohio  charter  part one  administrative three  traffic five  general offenses seven  business regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances the comparative is included to show the

standards were established to enhance the development pattern along primary commercial corridors in the past the development of primary commercial corridors focused on automobile travel and usually overlooked pedestrian mobility thus commercial development resulted in challenging pedestrian travel and a lack of connectivity between the streets and buildings due to large parking lots in addition the overall architectural pattern of these corridors has not contained significant traditional or natural materials the existing building setbacks and site orientation have also created a disjointed pattern in areas which have contributed to the lack of overall character and image of the city 2important goals of these standards include improving pedestrian mobility accommodating multiple transportation options and enhancing landscaping and building appearance improving these corridors will help maintain a highquality community for residents and businesses and create an economic environment to attract and support future development the overlay standards are intended to achieve the following objectives aimplement appropriate building and parking setback standards that accommodate redevelopment and establish continuity and consistency along the corridors  bpromote highquality building materials and timeless architecture  cestablish and reinforce pedestrianorientation  dpromote development that features landscaping facade transparency rear parking lots userfriendly access appropriately scaled lighting and signage  eenhance connectivity between
