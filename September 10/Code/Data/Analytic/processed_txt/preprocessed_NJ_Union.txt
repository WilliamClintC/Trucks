or by a fine not exceeding $1250 or by a period of community service not exceeding 90 days to become effective on the effective date of this section a findings of township committee 1 the township committee of the township of union hereby finds that there has been a significant breakdown in the supervision normally provided by certain parents and guidance for juveniles under 18 years of age resulting in juveniles being involved in a wide range of unacceptable behavior including vandalism noisy and rowdy behavior breaking and entering public drinking and littering and harassment of residents 2 the township committee further finds that the offensive activities of the juveniles are not easily controlled by existing laws and ordinances because the activities are easily concealed whenever police officers are present and that the establishment of reasonable curfew regulations will enable the community to better control the free and unobstructed access to the streets and public places by the majority of residents and will enable the police to act reasonably and fairly to prevent the violation of laws and ordinances by juveniles 3 the township committee further finds and has determined that a curfew meets a very real local need and that curfew ordinances in  2408 curfew  2421  other communities have been a significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency a curfew in the township of union is particularly appropriate in view of the basic residential nature of the community in the sense of the community that there is a proper time for the cessation of outdoor activities of juveniles that sense of community is reflected by the curfew hours declared by this chapter which take into consideration also the danger hours for nocturnal crime and for accumulations of juveniles with potential risk incident to immaturity b purpose 1 in enacting this chapter the township committee adopts the findings of the legislature expressed in pl 199 c 132 njsa 252 and has taken note of the peculiar vulnerability of children both as victims of crime and as perpetrators of offenses because of peer pressure this chapter is intended not only to prevent children from causing harm but also is intended to protect children themselves from being harmed as victims of nocturnal crime 2 the township of union is basically a family community parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the accepted norm by a substantial majority of the community legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a demonstrated effectiveness in many communities over the years the township committee has determined that as parental control increases there is a likelihood that juvenile delinquency decreases and that there is a need for a nocturnal curfew for juveniles in the township of union and that the establishment of a curfew applicable to juveniles will reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of parents and guardians over juveniles in their care and custody 3 it is not the intent of this chapter to supplant parental supervision the township committee recognizes the right of parents to direct their childrens upbringing and family autonomy against unreasonable interference the township committee is also aware that in cases in which harm to the physical or mental health of a child or to the public safety peace order or welfare is threatened the legitimate interests of the community as a whole may override the parents qualified right to control the upbringing of their children 4 the township committee also recognizes that juveniles are protected with certain constitutional rights and guaranties that are enjoyed by all citizens of this community it is not the intention of this chapter to deprive juveniles of the ability to exercise valid rights secured to them under the constitution of the united states or the state of new jersey the function of this chapter is instead to protect juveniles and to balance the right of all citizens of the township of union so that all may enjoy the rights and privileges of  2421 union code  2421   2422 definitions the following terms used in this chapter are defined as follows

157 art ii of the 1986   46224 findings and purpose the township committee finds and declares as follows a solid waste management within the township of union is a fundamental concern of the township committee due to the limited landfill space available rising costs of waste disposal and impacts on the environment b evidence available to the township committee indicates that discarded packaging especially takeout food service packaging constitutes a significant category of waste within the waste stream of the township of union the single greatest source of litter within the township and is therefore a necessary focus of any effort to reduce the amount of solid waste as well as reducing the economic and environmental cost of waste management for the citizens of the township of union c singleuse nonrecyclable nondegradable packaging and plastic containers is considered to be a fundamental cause of problems associated with municipal waste disposal and litter d chemical composition and the ability of a substance to degrade are meaningful and useful criteria to focus upon when establishing a public policy that is intended to improve the management and disposal of solid waste reduce the cumulative impact of litter encourage composting and other forms of recycling minimize the potential for toxic substances which form if solid waste is burned reduce the volume of ash byproducts that may be created by the burning of waste plastic packaging and otherwise anticipate environmental problems that may be caused by municipal solid waste disposal programs e the economic and environmental problems associated with nondegradable substances mixed with degradable substances in the waste stream are so severe that a program to modify the composition of the solid waste in the waste stream thereby reducing the environmental hazards and toxicity associated with solid waste incineration and encouraging the composting of putrescible biodegradable wastes and encouraging other forms of recycling of solid waste substances is hereby determined to be the policy of the township of union f certain retail food establishments within the township of union are the points of origin for a significant volume of packaging waste and 223 editors note this ordinance also provided that it shall apply to retail food transactions consummated on or after   46224 soil removal  46224   46225 definitions as used in this article the following terms shall have the meanings indicated therefore are particularly susceptible to actions which have significant potential for simplifying the composition of this portion of the township of unions solid waste stream thereby improving solid waste management with this township g the widespread use of plastics especially polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride pose a threat to the environment by posing unnecessary taking of landfill space andor when incinerated by the possible introduction of toxic byproducts into the atmosphere h the waste stream within the township of union is so large and diverse that any program to establish policies and laws conducive to any waste management program in lieu of landfilling must identify and set new policy for those specific sources of waste packaging which originate in this township i the use of polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride for food packaging is problematical because neither of these plastics are readily recyclable  their abundant commercial use in lieu of other plastics such as polyethylene or polypropylene unnecessarily complicates the chemical composition of the municipal waste and subtracts from the possible emergence of viable plastic recycling programs  and if burnt together polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride leave a relatively heavier and therefore more expensive ash residue to dispose of and evidence indicates that the burning of these products creates dioxin hydrochloric acid andor other toxic chemicals that could be admitted into the general environment of the township of union if incinerated j there are readily available plastic andor paper product substitutes for most of the polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride retail food packaging now being used in the township of union the use of which alternatives would be environmentally and economically advantageous to the citizens of the township of union k it is in the interest of the health safety and welfare of all of the citizens of the township of union who live work or do business in the township that the amount of nonrecyclable nondegradable packaging be reduced and that the amount of litter on the public streets parks and open spaces be reduced l therefore the purpose of this article is to to the maximum extent practical eliminate the use of nondegradable packaging originating at retail food establishments in the township of union in order to protect the air land and waters of the township of union from environmental contamination and degradation  46224 union code  46225  degradable

environmental protection and water resource management benefit it is necessary to protect and maintain the beneficial character of riparian areas by implementing specifications for the establishment protection and maintenance of vegetation along the surface water bodies within the jurisdiction of the township consistent with the interest of landowners in making reasonable economic use of parcels of land that include such designated areas the purpose of this article is to designate riparian zones and to provide for land use regulation therein in order to protect the streams lakes and other surface water bodies of the township  to protect the water quality of watercourses reservoirs lakes and other significant water resources within the township  to protect the riparian and aquatic ecosystems of the township  to provide for the environmentally sound use of the land resources of the township and to complement existing state regional county and municipal stream corridor protection and management regulations and initiatives the specific purposes and intent of this article are to a restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the water resources of the township  b prevent excessive nutrients sediment and organic matter as well as biocides and other pollutants from reaching surface waters by optimizing opportunities for filtration deposition absorption adsorption plant uptake biodegradation and denitrification which occur when stormwater runoff is conveyed buffers as stable distributed flow prior to reaching receiving waters  c provide for shading of the aquatic environment so as to moderate temperatures retain more dissolved oxygen and support a healthy assemblage of aquatic flora and fauna  d provide for the availability of natural organic matter leaves and twigs and large woody debris trees and limbs that provide food and habitat for aquatic organisms insects amphibians crustaceans and small fish which are essential to maintain the food chain  e increase stream bank stability and maintain natural fluvial geomorphology of the stream system thereby reducing stream bank 349 the requirements set forth in are consistent
