illumination standards the objective of parking lot and area lighting is to provide effective lighting for pedestrians and vehicular traffic all parking lot and area lighting systems shall be designed and certified to meet at a minimum the standards developed by the illuminating engineering society of north america iesna for area lighting for purposes of implementation of this section lighting design standards provided by the iesna handbook tenth edition shall be deemed to comply with this section these standards apply to all properties with the exception of parcels used for singlefamilydetached dwellings 1 ies area classifications the ies has established specific design criteria for the footcandle level and the uniformity ratio for parking lot and area lighting proper lighting designs require that the designer be familiar with the area classifications recommended by ies the classifications are based on the use of the area vehicle use only or general parking and pedestrian area and the areas activity level low medium or high definitions of the use and activity level classifications for parking and area lighting are as follows a use definitions 1 the term general parking and pedestrian area means areas where there may be a mixture of pedestrian and vehicular traffic such as businesses that may occasionally experience activity after dark and local or regional shopping centers 2 the term vehicular use area only means areas where conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians are not likely to occur such as service areas and access roads b activity level definitions 1 the term low activity level means areas where there are limited night activities such as outdoor storage areas and office building parking lots normally closed at night 2 the term medium activity level means areas normally used nightly such as fast food facilities area shopping centers hospital parking areas transportation parking cultural and civic events residential complex parking and community colleges 3 the term high activity level means areas where unusually high pedestrian andor vehicular traffic is expected such as major league athletic events major cultural or civic events and major regional shopping centers 2 recommended illuminance and uniformity the following table shows both minimum and average maintained illuminance values recommended by ies based on the areas activity level and use classification the minimum values shown are the lowest acceptable light levels at any location for the surface of the area during the life of the lighting system this is the major distinction between roadway and parking area lighting ies values ies roadway specifications state the average maintained footcandle value to be obtained with a specific uniformity ies parking area specifications state the minimum maintained footcandle level allowed in the parking area with a specific uniformity in roadway lighting the focus is on the average footcandle and uniformity specifications because roadway lighting deals with vehicles traveling at speeds that make average light levels and uniformity the critical issues parking lot lighting is task related in that it deals with pedestrians walking to and unlocking their vehicles the critical issues in parking lot lighting are minimum light levels and uniformity parking area maintained light level fc and

character of drivethru facilities and the increased frequency of vehicular movement onto and from the site which said uses are designed to generate it shall be the objective of this section to guide the location and development of said uses in a manner best deemed to serve public safety and welfare to this end the following additional requirements shall be applied in reviewing any proper use having drivethru facilities b no drivethru facility shall be permitted in the following cases 1 when the proposed property does not have direct access to a major arterial street 2 when the straightline distance between any point on the proposed property and any point on the property occupied by a church public school or public library having its primary access to the same street is five hundred 500 feet or less unless no undue vehicular traffic is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the approval of the proposed use 3 driveways curb cuts there shall be no more than one driveway for each one hundred 100 feet or major fraction thereof or lot frontage on any street driveways shall be separated by at least fifty 50 feet where they occur or a single property or on adjacent properties shared by adjacent properties driveway cuts shall not be over fortytwo 42 feet in width at the street line measured along the street line driveways shall be at least fifteen 15 feet from the side or rear property line on a corner lot all driveways shall be at least fifty 50 feet from the intersection of the street rightofway lines or from the intersection of said lines extended driveway access to a minor street providing access primarily to a residential area shall be permitted only if such driveway access may be provided without creating vehicular traffic congestion or a hazard to pedestrian traffic 4 where deemed desirable a proposed drivethru facility shall be required to coordinate the location and design of its driveways and curb cuts in accordance with the intent and objectives of this division 5 drivethru facilities defined any building structure or portion thereof designed or used with a window or other opening in the wall of a principal or accessory structure goods or services are provided directly to customers who remain in motor vehicles thereby eliminating the need for such customers to exit the vehicle this definition shall include but not be limited to drivethru restaurants banks laundry or dry cleaning establishments and other uses of a similar nature  they shall also include facilities known as takeout      design guidelines and standards for onsite roadway design a general 1 guidelines are not precise mandates however the principles concepts parameters or policies embodied therein shall not be ignored in traffic circulation design where site size and building setbacks permit their employment as the size of development increases the internal circulation system will require an increasing range of hierarchical facilities including local parking aisles building perimeter roads collectors access roads and ring road arterials 2 standards provided herein are considered minimums and must be met or exceeded in all new site plan designs 3 when existing nonconforming developments undergo major modifications reorganizations or renovation these guidelines and standards must be adopted andor incorporated into all existing parking lots parking areas and onsite roadways to the maximum extent practical consistent with maintaining an adequate number of parking spaces and physical constraints 4 all new developments and significantly modified existing developments are subject to site plan review and approval by the city council b definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this section and to facilitate understanding and planning adequate traffic circulation shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning community shopping centers means moderately sized developments of approximately two hundred fifty thousand 250000 square feet gla on about twentyfour 24 acres building perimeter roads are usually present large developments means developments with building gla of five hundred thousand 500000 square feet or more on sites exceeding forty 40 acres where the ratio of building footprint to total site area is approximately one to three  the full range of traffic circulation elements is usually present neighborhood shopping centers means shopping centers of approximately one hundred fifty thousand 150000 square feet gla small shopping areas means shopping areas with one hundred thousand 100000 square feet gla or less small traffic generators neighborhood shopping centers strip commercial sites and small shopping areas usually qualify for direct access to collector roadways but not arterials an intermediate collector road service road or cross accesscross parking agreement should be used to combine the traffic flows from several commercial developments to justify an intersection with an arterial street strip commercial means commercial sites with depths of one hundred ten 110 feet or less and building setbacks usually seventy 70 to eighty 80 feet very large developments means sites consisting of office parks apartment complexes or regional shopping malls containing eighty 80 acres or more 35m square feet with building gross leasable area gla of 12m square feet and the remainder of the site devoted to open space roadways parking and landscaping these developments usually include the full range of circulation elements driveways are the functional equivalent of an arterial street signalized intersection with an arterial street is justified very small generators means small standalone facilities such as a convenience store or a bank which have onsite circulation systems equivalent to a local access street  the driveway is the equivalent of nothing more than a collector c guidelines 1 a concept of hierarchical circulation shall be designed into the internal circulation system of the site similar to the function hierarchy of public roads refer to schematic a as the size of a development increases the internal circulation system will require an increasing range from the hierarchy facilities a large commercial or industrial development will incorporate the entire spectrum of functional facilities smaller developments will include a more limited range of functional facilities for example the aisles leading to individual parking spaces vehicle terminal become the equivalent of the local access streets some parallels between public streets and onsite circulation are classification of public street comparable internal circulation local aisle within parking lot minor collector circulation aisles at end of parking rows access drive of small standalone business major collector circulation road connecting parking spaces within a large development access drive of a moderatesize development such as a community shopping center minor arterial access drive of a large development major arterial access drive to a very large mixeduse development or a regionalsuperregional shopping center b the design standards for onsite circulation roadways should be similar to those of public streets for the same operating speeds however operating speeds on the onsite facilities generally will be lower than the comparable class of public street 2 large commercial office retail and industrial sites should incorporate a major collectordistributor roadway which interconnects the access drives with the individual parking areas 3 ring roads should be used on large and very large developments to provide primary onsite circulation and to discourage use of the building perimeter roadway for movement from one part of the site to another 4 traffic circulation and pedestrian patterns should be such that all customers cross the building perimeter road as pedestrians moving between the parking stalls and the buildings 5 tangent or long radius sections of building perimeter roads should be less than four hundred 400 feet 6 minimum inside radii on building perimeter roads measured back of curb should be between thirty 30 and fifty 50 feet 7 all building perimeter roadways should be designated as fire lanes so that nostoppingnoparking rules can be enforced emergency vehicles have direct access to the building and so that parked cars do not interfere with the visibility of pedestrians about to cross the perimeter roadway 8 landscaping not curb height should be used for the delineation of onsite circulation features and to discourage drivers from traversing designated areas therefore fourinch or other low profile curbs may be used on ring and perimeter roads and other onsite circulation treatment sixinch curbing will be used only when essential for surface drainage 9 tee threeway intersections should be used for onsite design in order to minimize conflicts and simplify maneuver areas 10 in neighborhood centers and other small traffic generators the size of the site commonly requires that the parking bays be parallel to the building 11 overthesidewalk delivery should be used only as an auxiliary method 12 where large developments are involved one of two 2 basic layouts should be used a locate the buildings at least five hundred 500 feet back from the street this will provide a throat length of two hundred fifty 250 feet which is necessary for a high capacity access drive and adequate parking bay lengths between the ring road and the building face b orient the long dimension of linear developments perpendicular to the arterial this will provide for long signalized access spacing and good onsite circulation 13 parking and circulation considerations for drivethru facilities include a separation of the drivethru traffic from the other site traffic and parking b clear identification and delineation between the drivethru and parking lot circulation c provision for adequate queue storage that prevents queue interference with pedestrian or other vehicular movement d provision of an escape route e for fast food restaurants the distance between the order board and the pickup window should be sufficient to store four 4 cars not including cars at the board and window d standards 1 access locations and design standards including throat width curb return radii and median channelizations shall be in accordance with florida department of transportation fdot standards as supplemented by standards of the institute of transportation engineers ite when there is no conflict 2 roadways along the perimeters of buildings shall be limited to circulation at the end of parking rows or bays customer pickup and dropoff and emergency access to the building 3 roadways adjacent to the building shall have an uninterrupted length of no more than four hundred 400 feet to discourage high vehicular speeds and volumes and pedestrianvehicular conflicts 4 the installation of speed bumps or speed humps is prohibited 5 minimum width of the perimeter roadway shall be twentyseven 27 feet between the face of the curb on the sidewalk adjacent to the building and the face of end island curbs the maximum width shall not exceed twentynine 29 feet to discourage stopping and parking 6 in large developments the primary parking shall be oriented with the parking bays perpendicular to the building face where building setbacks permit moderate size developments shall also incorporate this standard 7 parking adjacent to the building is prohibited except on small generator parking lots where parking turnover is very low and for parking for persons with disabilities 8 parking aisles should not exceed three hundred 300 feet without a break in circulation this facilitates customer utilization and helps to eliminate high speeds 9 end islands shall be used to delineate the onsite circulation roadway at the edge of the parking lots or bays and to protect autos parked at the end of each row or bay from turning vehicles 10 end islands shall be curbed and landscaped 11 curbs which serve as wheel stops shall not exceed four 4 inches in height 12 paved overhangs of two and onehalf 212 feet shall be constructed in connection with curbing at the closed end of parking stalls when landscaping is present and individual bumper stops are not used this avoids trampled and burnedout landscaping 13 ring roads perimeter roads and access drives shall be curbed 14 parking lot separators shall be curbed and landscaped 15 onsite parking facilities containing twentyfive 25 or more parking spaces shall install and maintain traffic control devices in accordance with the manual of uniform traffic control

in the calculation of the landscaped area landscaping means any combination of living plants such as grass ground cover shrubs vines hedges or trees and nonliving landscape material such as rocks pebbles sand mulch or decorative paving materials microirrigation low volume means the frequent application of small quantities of water directly on or below the soil surface usually as discrete drops tiny streams or miniature sprays placed along the water delivery pipes laterals microirrigation encompasses a number of methods or concepts including drip subsurface bubbler and spray irrigation previously referred to as trickle irrigation low volume or low flow irrigation mulch means nonliving organic or synthetic materials customarily used in landscape design to retard erosion and retain

shall be spaced and located to accommodate their mature size on the site the water use zones are as follows a high water use zone oasis an area of the site limited to a maximum of fifty 50 percent of the total landscaped area plants and turf types which within this area are associated with moist soils and require supplemental water in addition to natural rainfall to survive this zone includes shallow rooted turf grass varieties b moderate water use zone drought tolerant plants which survive on natural rainfall with supplemental water during seasonal dry periods this zone includes deep rooted turf grass varieties c low water use zone natural plants which survive on natural rainfall without supplemental water because of the relatively high water requirements of turf grass no presently available varieties are included in this category b soil analysis 1 soils will vary from site to site and even within a given site a soil analysis based on random sampling is recommended the soil analysis will provide information that will enable proper selection of plants and if needed soil amendments when appropriate soil amendments can achieve the health and growing capabilities of the landscape by improving drainage moisture penetration and a soils water and nutrient holding capacity 2 to ensure the proper selection of plants for the site a soil analysis for the measurement of ph should be completed c appropriate plant selection 1 according to state statute plant selection must consider prohibited invasive exotic plant species and controlled plant species the following are

calculated in step 1 to assess the need for mitigation available capacity see subsection d of this section minus the number of new student stations needed to accommodate the proposed development equals the shortfall negative number or surplus positive number of capacity to serve the development step 3 evaluating the available capacity in contiguous service areas if step 2 results in a negative number repeat that step for one or more contiguous service areas if this step results in a negative number then proceed to step 4 to calculate the proportionate share mitigation step 4 calculating proportionate share mitigation needed additional student stations from step 3 multiplied by average cost per student station plus additional costs see subsection d of this section equals proportionateshare mitigation obligation the full cost of proportionate share mitigation shall be required from the development proposal at the time of initial adoption of the psfe the student

telecommunications equipment and facilities in the public rightsofway to satisfy the demand for telecommunications services raises important issues with respect to the citys responsibility to manage its public rightsofway 4 the public rightsofway must be managed and controlled in a manner that enhances the health safety and general welfare of the city and its citizens 5 the use and occupancy of the public rightsofway by utilities and providers of communications services must be subject to regulation which can ensure minimal inconvenience to the public coordinate users maximize available
