intent a the state legislature and governor amended general municipal law  103 a08692s6117 on  to provide local governments greater flexibility in awarding contracts by authorizing the award of purchase contracts including contracts for service work on the basis of best value the state legislation requires political subdivisions with a population of less than 1000000 to pass a local law authorizing the use of the best value award process b from assembly bill memo a08692 enactment of this chapter provides additional procurement options to localities in ways that may expedite the procurement process and result in cost savings the best value standard for selecting goods and services vendors including janitorial and security contracts is critical to efforts to use strategic sourcing principles to modernize the supply chain and ensure that taxpayers obtain the highest quality goods and services at the lowest potential cost while also ensuring fairness to all competitors c the federal government approximately half of the states and many localities have added best value selection processes to their procurement options in recognition of these advantages with the increased complexity of the goods and services that municipalities must obtain in order to serve taxpayers it is critical to consider selection and evaluation criteria that measure factors other than cost in the strictest sense d taxpayers are not well served when a public procurement results in low unit costs at the outset but ultimately engenders cost escalations due to factors such as inferior quality poor reliability and difficulty of maintenance best value procurement links the procurement process directly to the municipalitys performance requirements incorporating selection factors such as useful lifespan quality and options and incentives for more timely performance andor additional services e even if the initial expenditure is higher considering the total value over the life of the procurement may result in a better value and longterm investment of public funds best value procurement also encourages competition and in turn often results in better pricing quality and customer service fostering healthy competition ensures that bidders will continue to strive for excellence in identifying and meeting municipalities needs including such important goals as the  6220 gates code  632   633 definitions as used in this chapter the following terms shall have the meanings indicated best value  the basis for awarding contracts for services to the offerer who optimizes quality cost

of contracts for services  634 requirements participation of small minority and womenowned businesses and the development of environmentally preferable goods and service delivery methods best value procurement will provide muchneeded flexibility in obtaining important goods and services at favorable prices and will reduce the time to procure such goods and services a where the basis for award is the best value offer the comptroller director of finance shall document in the procurement record and in advance of the initial receipt of offers the determination of the evaluation criteria which whenever possible shall be quantifiable and the process to be used in the determination of best value and the manner in which the evaluation process and selection shall be conducted 1 the comptrollerdirector of finance shall select a formal competitive procurement process in accordance with general municipal law and town of gates purchasing policies and document its determination in the procurement record the process shall include but is not limited to a clear statement of need  a description of the required specifications governing performance and related factors  a reasonable process for ensuring a competitive field  a fair and equal opportunity for offerers to submit responsive offers  and a balanced and fair method of award where the basis for the award is best value documentation in the procurement record shall where practicable include a quantification of the application of the criteria to the rating of proposals and the evaluation results or where not practicable such other justification which demonstrates that best value will be achieved b the solicitation shall prescribe the minimum specifications or requirements that must be met in order to be considered responsive and shall describe and disclose the general manner in which the evaluation and selection shall be conducted where appropriate the solicitation shall identify the relative

control adopted 172008 by ll no 12008  1571 introduction  purpose a land disturbance activities and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites b during the construction process soil is the most vulnerable to erosion by wind and water this eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species eroded soil also necessitates maintenance andor repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of waterways in addition clearing andor grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and causes the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat and to provide a healthy living environment for citizens of the town of gates improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow regulation of land disturbance activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development c as a result the purpose of this article is to safeguard public health protect property prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction
