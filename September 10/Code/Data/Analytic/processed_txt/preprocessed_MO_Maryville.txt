any other violations which may include a violation of best management practices which the wastewater superintendent determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program ordinance article viii affirmative defenses to discharge violations defenses to upset  a for the purposes of this upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user an upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventative maintenance or careless or improper operation b an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of c below are met c a user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that 1 an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  2 the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  and 3 the user has submitted the following information to the wastewater treatment superintendent within twentyfour 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five 5 days  and a a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance  b the period of noncompliance including exact dates and time  or if not corrected the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue  and c steps being taken andor planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance d in any enforcement proceeding the burden of proof shall be upon the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset e users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards ordinance defenses to prohibited discharge standards  defenses to bypass  f users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails a a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general discharge standards prohibitions of this the specific discharge standard prohibitions of this if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city of maryville was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements a for the purpose of this  bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a users treatment facility 2 severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of c and d of this city code reserved 1 if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the wastewater treatment superintendent at least ten 10 days before the date of the bypass 2 a user shall submit oral notice to the superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twentyfour 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five 5 days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of the bypass 3 if the oral report has been received within twentyfour 24 hours the wastewater treatment superintendent may waive the written report requirement on a casebycase basis d 1 bypass is prohibited and the superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required under paragraph c of this the wastewater treatment superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the wastewater treatment superintendent determines that it will meet the three 3 conditions listed in d1 of this adopting ordinance article ix rates charges and fees treatment rates  charges and fees  a the municipal the city of maryville

superintendent may immediately suspend a users discharge whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons after notice and opportunity to respond the wastewater treatment superintendent may also immediately suspend a users discharge where that discharge threatens to interfere with the operation of the potw or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment 1 any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution in the event of a users failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order the wastewater treatment superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection to prevent or minimize damage to the potw its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals the wastewater treatment superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the wastewater treatment superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed 2 a user that is responsible in whole or in part for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence said statement shall be submitted to the wastewater treatment city code of discharge  superintendent ten 10 days prior to the date of any show cause or
