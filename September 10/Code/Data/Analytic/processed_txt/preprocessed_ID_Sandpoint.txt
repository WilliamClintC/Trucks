severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b bypass a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections c and d of this section c prior notice if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the potw at least ten 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible a user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty four 24 hours from the time it becomes aware

bypass is prohibited and the potw may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless 1 bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  2 there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and 3 the user submitted notices as required under subsection c of this section the potw may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the potw determines that it will meet the three 3 conditions listed in this subsection d e upset 1 for the purposes of this section upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user an upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation  sterling codifiers inc  140303 2 an upset shall

of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails f prohibited discharge standards a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in section 775 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause passinterference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the passinterference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements  7721 right of revision the city reserves the right to amend this chapter to provide for more stringent limitations

expenditures for flood relief and protection  and e impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by structures in flood hazard areas which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages as well as by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities 3 local government units have the primary responsibility for planning adopting and enforcing land use regulations to accomplish proper floodplain management c statement of

flood control projects  5 minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with flooding generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  6 minimize prolonged business interruptions  7 ensure potential buyers are notified the property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 ensure those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions d objectives and methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purpose this chapter includes methods and provisions to 1 require that development which is vulnerable to floods including structures and facilities necessary for the general health safety and welfare of citizens be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  2 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  3 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion  4 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazards to other lands  5
