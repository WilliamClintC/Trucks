and 8 of of   and of of the north carolina general statutes delegated to local governmental the responsibility units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry 2 findings of fact a the flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of wallace are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards 3 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to a restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  wallace north carolina adopted  zoning districts unified development c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  d control filling grading dredging and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 4 objectives the objectives of this chapter are a to protect human life and health  b to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d to minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions  e to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities ie water and gas mains electric telephone cable and sewer lines streets and bridges that are located in flood prone areas  f to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas  and g to ensure that potential

to the community when determining what improvements are reasonable c multiple detached dwellings on a single parcel the town recognizes that some historic development patterns are inconsistent with modern requirements and that some of the existing development patterns are part of the historic character of the town the town finds that when such historic patterns persist into the present in a way that is consistent with the nearby surrounding development it may advance the towns interest in preserving its historic character to allow the inconsistent pattern to remain but to regulate the inconsistent land use in a manner as consistent with the modern requirements as possible to prevent unintended consequences therefore where two 2 or more detached single family residential structures
