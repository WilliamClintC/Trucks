codified into the california government title 9 entitled political reform   81000 et seq this enactment is commonly referred to as the political reform act of 197 hereinafter the political reform act among other things the political reform act subjected all public officials to rigorous conflicts of interest provisions and imposed explicit regulation and accountability for political campaign contributions and expenditures on elected officials this chapter shall be known as the city of santa clara political campaign finance reform act act it is intended to supplement the provisions of the political reform act as it is amended from time to time in some instances the act is intended to be a convenient single source reminder of the applicable state law in other instances the provisions of the act are expressly intended to be more restrictive than the political reform act  11100   42214  findings and declarations in enacting this chapter the following findings and declarations are adopted a monetary contributions to political campaigns are a legitimate form of participation in the american political process but large contributions may have an undue influence on candidates or create the appearance of an undue influence in the political process b the rapidly increasing costs of political campaigns have forced many candidates to raise larger and larger percentages of money from individuals and interest groups with a specific financial stake in matters before the city council this has caused a public perception that votes are being improperly influenced by monetary contributions to candidates this perception is undermining the credibility and integrity of the governmental process c high campaign costs are forcing officeholders to spend more time on fundraising and less time on the publics business the periodic pressure to raise contributions distracts officeholders from urgent governmental matters d the integrity of the governmental process the competitiveness of campaigns and public confidence in local officials are all diminishing e campaign contributions and campaign expenditures in municipal election campaigns should be fully and truthfully disclosed in order that the voters may be fully informed about a candidates sources of campaign contributions f specific findings regarding two tiered contribution limits the contribution limits set forth in sccc  herein are based on the following specific findings 1 individual contributions in excess of five hundred dollars $50000 may result in the reasonable perception by the public of the appearance of undue influence on successful candidates by larger contributors limiting contributions below this level for candidates accepting the voluntary expenditure limits of this chapter will bolster the publics trust in the local electoral process 2 limiting contributions to two hundred fifty dollars $25000 for candidates who do not accept voluntary campaign limits represents a reasonable incentive for candidates to accept voluntary expenditure limits without reducing any candidates ability to effectively campaign or to reasonably raise adequate campaign funds 3 the difference between the alternative contribution limits is not calculated to deny any candidate the option of not accepting expenditure limits rather it is intended to reflect a meaningful distinction to be appreciated by both candidates and the public encouraging fair elections free from the perceived negative effects of excessive campaign spending  11100   42214  purpose of this chapter this chapter is to be liberally construed to effectuate the following purposes a ensure that individuals and interest groups in the city have a fair opportunity to participate in the municipal elective and governmental processes b reduce the influence of large contributors with a specific financial stake in matters before the city council thus countering the perception that decisions are influenced more by the size of contributions than the best interests of the people of the city c encourage candidates to limit their overall expenditures in campaigns thereby reducing the pressure on candidates to raise large campaign war chests for defensive purposes beyond the amount necessary to communicate reasonably with voters d increase the value of smaller contributions to candidates e reduce the fund raising advantage of incumbents and thus encourage competition for elective office f allow candidates and officeholders to spend a lesser portion of their time on fund raising and a greater portion of their time dealing with issues of importance to their constituents g improve the disclosure of contribution sources in reasonable and effective ways h help restore public trust in governmental and electoral institutions  11100   42214 definitions  interpretation of this chapter unless a term is specifically defined in this chapter or the contrary is stated or clearly appears from the context

policy since 1978  to limit the number of outdoor advertising signs also commonly referred to as billboards to no more than sixty 60 physically in place in order to improve the quality of urban life for its citizens it had been determined that billboards by their very nature wherever located and however constructed constitute visual clutter and blight to the appearance of the city it has also been determined that billboards impede traffic safety by unduly distracting motorists and pedestrians creating traffic hazards and reducing the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public the city reasserts its policy that the obtrusive nature of billboards makes it imperative that the city control the number size and location of billboards it is the continued position of the city council that billboards are not permitted within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city unless a particular billboard location has been approved in the absence of a billboard location receiving affirmative approval from the city council the application was denied it is the city councils intent hereby to permit no more billboards within the city and to thereby restrict the presence of billboards in the city by limiting the number of billboards to those physically in place or for which approvals have been granted as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter additionally as billboards are physically removed or destroyed it is the intent of the city council that the number of billboards will be permanently reduced by that number as of  there are fortyeight 48 billboards physically in place there are two signs which have been treated historically as directional signs and there is one approval for a directional sign yet to be constructed it is the intent of the city council to encompass all signs which conceivably could be construed as billboards within the definition of billboard consequently the total of fiftyone 51 billboards is the starting point and ceiling for billboards at the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter it is the express intent of the city council to permit no further billboards within the city and to reduce their number rather than pay compensation pursuant to the provisions of commencing with  of of division iii of the california business and professions which provisions require compensation for billboards removed at governmental insistence b general provisions billboards are subject to the following 1 existing billboards shall not be relocated on the property 2 there shall be no moving rotating or revolving signs or panels 3 signs are to be painted repaired backed with lattice when singlefaced and panels aligned as appropriate and maintained in good condition 4 the signs and sites of signs are to be maintained in a clean condition and landscaping is required where such is practical 5 in no event shall the total of billboards in the entire city exceed fiftyone 51 6 there are currently fiftyone 51 billboards in place or approved for construction if and when a billboard either nonconforming or with a permit is physically destroyed or in a state of disrepair fifty percent 50% or more of its reasonable construction value in either case dismantled removed ceases to be used as a billboard for at least one hundred twenty 120 consecutive calendar days or is in any way terminated for any reason the maximum number of billboards permitted to be in the city shall be reduced by that extent zoning   outdoor advertising display relocation agreements a notwithstanding the provisions in sccc
