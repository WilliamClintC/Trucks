1991 amended 6 july 1998 town of enfield board of selectmen class vi roads policy purpose the selectmen recognize and are concerned about the potential for scattered or premature development in areas that are not adequately accessible to emergency vehicles and which otherwise lack satisfactory public services the town of enfield has been presented with an increasing number of requests for building permits on class vi roads presently there is a need for standards by which the selectmen can evaluate an application for a building permit on a class vi road the standards would provide the selectmen and the planning board with guidance in evaluating the merits of a request for a building permit on a class vi road and would prevent arbitrary and inconsistent results the following is not to be considered an exhaustive statement on class vi roads and each case will be decided on a case by case basis policy it shall be the policy of the selectmen in accordance with the master plan zoning subdivision regulations and previous town vote expressing the intent to preserve class vi roads as recreationalconservational public ways to discourage construction on class vi roads the board may take such actions as it deems necessary to insure against the scattered or premature development of land that could involve danger or injury to the public health safety and welfare due to the lack of water supply drainage access or other public services or that would necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services except as otherwise provided below each request for a building permit on a class vi road shall be reviewed by the planning board and evaluated according to the following criteria a road condition 1 length of road 2 width of traveled way 3 width of rightofway 4 road surface and condition 5 condition of the road bed with regard to the depth and quality of gravels 6 steepness of the grade on the portion of the road being considered 7 the existence

development b intensity of use 1 the ability of two cars to safely pass each other 2 the ability of a plow truck to pass along the road 3 the ability of a fire truck or emergency vehicle to pass along the road 4 the distance to the closest class v or higher quality road 5 the number of existing homes already located on the class vi road 6 the distance to the closest residence 7 the distance to municipal services such as police fire water sewer utilities and schools 8 the consistency of the proposed development with the master plan 9 any other factors which would affect the suitability of the road for use by the proposed development by using these criteria the planning board and selectmen may determine which class vi roads would be suitable for the issuance of building permits that would not cause premature and scattered development not distort the master plan cause financial or access hardships to future purchasers of the subject property or undue financial impact on the municipality upon favorable review by the planning board according to the above criteria it shall be the policy of the board of selectmen that when a permit is approved it shall be allowed at a density not to exceed one single family dwelling with accessory uses per parcel of land any further property development shall require review by the planning board under the standards for site plan review persons desiring to build and gain access off a class vi road after a favorable recommendation by the planning board may be permitted to do so by the selectmen provided that they agree to bring the road up to minimum standards approved by the planning board and the board of selectmen these standards shall adhere as closely as possible to the town of enfield road design standards established in the subdivision regulations except that the width of the traveled way shall be a minimum of 16 feet and the shoulders shall be a minimum of 2 feet a building permit will not be granted prior to the receipt of a performance bond covering the expense of necessary road improvements in compliance with all applicable laws ordinances and regulations in a case where a yearround single family dwelling has already been established on a class 6 road by this permit process an additional building permit for an accessory use to that dwelling may be issued without further planning board or board of selectmen consideration a notice of the limits of municipal responsibility and liability in a form satisfactory to the board of selectmen shall be recorded in the grafton county registry of deeds prior to the issuance of any building permit authorized hereunder maintenance it shall be the responsibility of landowners who have been granted permission to build on class vi roads to maintain at

division cross connection program i purpose crossconnections between water supplies and nonportable sources of contamination can represent one of the most significant threats to health in the water supply industry these program regulations are designed to maintain the safety and potability of the water in the enfield water system by establishing rules and procedures to control crossconnection situations and to prevent the contamination of public drinking water by the backflow of water or other fluids from a source or sources other than its intended or approved sources of supply a the purpose of this regulation is 1 to protect the public water supply of the area served by the enfield water department from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within its customers internal distribution systems such contaminants or pollutants which could backflow or backsiphon into the public water supply system  and 2 to promote the elimination or control of existing crossconnections actual or potential between its customers inplant potable water systems and nonpotable  and 3 to provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of crossconnection control which will effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems by crossconnection this document is intended to supplement the rules promulgated by the new hampshire department of

ofthis program the enfield water department will perform evaluations and inspections of plans andor premises and inform the owner by letter of any corrective action deemed necessary the method of achieving the correction and the time allowed for the correction to be made ordinarily ninety 90 days will be allowed however this time period may be shortened depending upon the degree of hazard involved and the history of the devices in question 3 the enfield water department will not allow any crossconnection to remain unless it is protected by an approved backflow preventer for which a

devices any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the enfield water department to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supercede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health x periodic testing a backflow prevention devices shall be inspected and tested at least semiannually for high hazard devices and annually for low hazard devices b periodic inspections shall be performed by the enfield water departments certified inspector or his delegated representative the inspections will be done at the owners expense on a time and materials basis for the current chargeable rates of the equipment and personnel involved c the inspections shall be conducted during the enfield water departments regular business hours exceptions to this when at the request of the owner may require additional charges to cover the increased costs to the enfield water department d any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic inspection will be repaired or replaced when repairs are necessary upon completion of the repair the device will be inspected a second time at the owners expense to insure correct operation high hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the inspection and cannot be repaired immediately in other situations a compliance date of not more than thirty 30 days after the inspection date will be established the owner is responsible for spare parts repair tools or a replacement device parallel installation of two 2 devices is an effective means of the owner insuring that uninterrupted water service during inspections or repair of devices  and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such continuity e these devices shall be repaired or replaced at the expense of the owner whenever said devices are found to be defective tests and repairs shall be recorded on forms approved by the public works director  and copies distributed to the owner and enfield water department within 10 days of the actual test f backflow prevention devices will be inspected more frequently than specified in a above in cases where there is a history of test failures and the enfield water department feels that due to the degree of hazard involved additional inspections are warranted cost of the additional inspections will be borne by the owner xi records and reports a records the enfield water department will initiate and maintain the following 1 master files on customer crossconnection inspections andor tests 2 master files on crossconnection permits 3 copies of permits and permit applications 4 copies of inspection results and summaries supplied to des b reports the enfield water department will submit the following to des

for reinspections b charges 1 charges for after hours inspections addendum i residential dual check a effective the date of acceptance of this crossconnection control program for the enfield water department all new residential buildings will be required to install a residential dual check valve device immediately downstream of the water meter installation of this residential dual check valve device on a retrofit basis on existing service lines will be instituted at a time and at a potential cost to the homeowner as deemed necessary by the enfield water department b the owner should be aware that installation of a residential dual check valve results in a potential closed plumbing system with the residence as such provisions may have to be made by the owner to provide for thermal expansion within the closed loop system ie the installation of thermal expansion devices andor pressure relief valves ii strainers a the enfield water department strongly recommends that all new retrofit installations of reduced pressure principle devices and double check valve backflow preventers include the installation of strainers located immediately upstream of the device to prevent fouling of backflow devices due to unforeseen circumstances occurring to the water supply system such as water main repairs water main breaks fires periodic cleaning and flushing of mains etc these occurrences may stir up debris within the water main that will cause fouling ofbackflow devices installed without the benefit of strainers adopted  b fred cummings donald j crate sr enfield board of

processing of each application and communication problems develop quickly if great care is not taken from the start to prevent communication problems from developing it is important for both the town and the applicant to designate one person each to coordinate all communications this prevents repetition of questions prevents two people from giving different answers to the same question and should help to keep interpretation of opinions consistent  applicants authorized representative the application form shall designate one person to act as the authorized representative all communication to the applicant shall be made person and this person shall be present at all meetings with the board in the text of these regulations references to the applicant shall also imply the authorized representative  town 1 all communications to the town shall be directed to the community development director in writing unless otherwise directed by the chairman of the board this may be more likely during larger applications such as when an engineer reviewing the road design needs to talk to the design engineer to clarify issues 2 individual board members must exercise care when discussing application matters with the applicant abutters or other parties outside the forum of the boards meetings an individual board member has no authority to bind the board care must be taken to keep an open mind throughout the entire process not drawing conclusions until all relevant information has been received at the public hearing additionally board members should tell the board and the public the substance of any information they have received from the applicant abutters or other parties so that all can benefit from this knowledge and to provide an opportunity to challenge any information provided 3 rsa  disqualification of member i no member of a zoning board of adjustment building code board of appeals planning board heritage commission historic district commission agricultural commission or housing commission shall participate in deciding or shall sit upon the hearing of any question which the board is to decide in a judicial capacity if that member has a direct personal or pecuniary interest in the outcome which differs from the interest of other citizens or if that member would be disqualified for any cause to act as a juror upon the trial of the same matter in any action at law reasons for disqualification do not include exemption from service as a juror or knowledge of the facts involved gained in the performance of the members official duties ii when uncertainty arises as to the application of paragraph i to a board member in particular circumstances the board shall upon the request of that member or another member of the board vote on the question of whether that member should be disqualified any such request and vote shall be made prior to or at the commencement of any required public hearing such a vote shall be advisory and nonbinding and may not be requested by persons other than board members except as provided by local ordinance or by a procedural rule adopted under rsa  iii if a member is disqualified or unable to act in any particular case pending before the board the chairperson shall designate an alternate to act in the members place as provided in rsa  17 general guidance the following advice is offered to assist the applicant especially if the applicant is unfamiliar with land development processes  all applicants will need to hire professionals to prepare part or all of the application a nh licensed land surveyor andor licensed professional engineer are required in some cases other specialists will be needed possibly including an attorney a certified soil scientist css certified wetland scientist cws permitted septic designer psd or others while such assistance does cost money their skills and abilities are essential to ensure that the town and applicant have sound information on which to base their decisions  the boards goal is to process all applications fairly and quickly to accomplish this the applicant shares certain responsibilities the applicant must be properly prepared this includes reading these regulations to understand the issues that must be addressed and includes dealing with all the significant issues up front incomplete submittals poorly drafted plans or failure to properly address issues will result in unnecessary delays in obtaining a final decision from the board if a potential conflict of interest arises between a board member and applicant due to a personal professional or other relationship between a board member and an applicant unfair bias etc the party claiming bias on the part of a planning board member must raise the issue before the board at the earliest possible time the board member may volunteer or be asked by the board andor applicant to recuse themselves from discussions or formal voting related to review of the application this disqualified individual may still be counted as present as necessary to provide a quorum  the application process is similar for all applications although the amount of work and time to obtain an approval vary widely 1 process all applications follow this basic process  preparation the applicant prepares the application usually done by hired professionals this may involve some discussion with the board phase i nonbinding conceptual consultation or phase ii design review meetings  application acceptance upon submittal of the application materials to the town and the payment of all fees the application is placed on the next available planning board agenda for consideration by state law there is a minimum requirement for posting and notification of hearings because of this applications are due at least 21 calendar days prior to next scheduled hearing date in which an application must be submitted for consideration on the agenda  public hearing all applications will have a public hearing this is the official opportunity for the public to ask questions about the application to raise issues offer suggestions or indicate their support or opposition the hearing may be interspersed with periods of deliberation by the board and may be continued to future dates  decision in the end the board must decide whether to approve or deny the application in the majority of cases the board approves the application with conditions which means that there are additional administrative or technical requirements which must be satisfied to obtaining the final approval 2 timing the planning board meets 12 times per month on the second andor fourth wednesday of the month at a minimum there must be a meeting with the board and this alone requires at least 21 calendar days leadtime between when application is submitted to the hearing date simple applications are often approved at a single meeting while more complex applications may take two or three months to complete however this is all based on the assumptions that the applicant is properly prepared and that no unusual circumstances arise without the applicants consent it is very unlikely that an application process can take longer than three months article 2 procedure for site plan review 21 general there are three phases in the site plan review process nonbinding consultation and conceptual consultation phase i design review phase ii and final application review phase iii phase i which involves a discussion of the proposed concept only in general terms is optional and does not require a public hearing phase ii involves a more detailed discussion and review of the site plan proposed this phase is also optional although a public hearing is required by state law phase i and phase ii are intended to help the applicant by providing the applicant with guidance and feedback prior to submission of the final application thereby helping to avoid major alteration of the final drawings the last phase phase iii is submission and review of the final application this phase is required for all developments and modifications subject to site plan review a public hearing is required for phase iii a single hearing for phase ii and phase iii may be held if the hearing notice indicates the board will be considering both phases at the one hearing  phase i  nonbinding consultation and conceptual consultation in order to save expense and unnecessary changes later on an applicant may request to be on the agenda of a formal meeting of the board for discussion of their proposed concept in general terms and for a review of applicable site plan review regulations application forms necessary supporting maps and documents there is no application fee or time limit for this nor is this consultation and review

removal and ice control governing laws rsa a rsa 507b2b approval date  next review date october 2005 objective it is the goal and intent of the town of enfield public works department to provide timely efficient and costeffective winter maintenance snow removal and ice control on the roadways of the municipality for the safety and benefit of the towns residents and the general motoring public procedure the objective stated above will be attempted by implementation and execution of the procedures and tasks outlined in the town of enfield winter operations snow removal and ice control procedures due to the many variables that are inherent in new england weather each storm andor weather event may require slightly different effort or emphasis on any number of maintenance tasks which together determine the overall winter maintenance snow removal and ice control strategy level of service it is not possible to maintain a black snow and icefree roadway or sidewalk during a storm it is the intent of the department to provide practical safe access to homes businesses and municipal facilities within our limits of service during winter storm events it is our intent to start to conduct snow removal operations upon accumulations of one inch of snowfall the public works director or highway supervisor may at his or her discretion based upon weather information reports obtained by emergency services and forecasting elect to not remove snow until greater or lesser accumulation has ceased during the night when traffic volumes are low the department may elect to cease operations for a few hours if the snowfall is not significant in intensity and no change in the intensity of snowfall is predicted chemical pretreatment and ice control may be addressed prior to the actual storm beginning during the actual storm as seen effective and after the storm it should be noted that salt has a much slower effect on melting snow and ice at temperatures below 20 degrees and may not be applied until it is warmer sidewalk snow clearance and chemical treatment will be conducted during winter storms chemical treatments of road surfaces are done throughout the storm on an as needed basis in problematic areas at a minimum however at or towards the close of the storm event the plan will call for a more aggressive treatment to assist in the clearing process of all roadways in the town command direction of all winter maintenance activities for the town of enfield is vested with the public works director or highway supervisor or his or her designee any & all requests comments or problems shall be directed chain of command at all times execution the policy outlined above is intended to serve as the normal operating procedures for winter maintenance snow removal andor ice control for the town of enfield department of public works one or more of the following may delay prevent or impact the implementation of this policy in part or as a whole  equipment breakdown  snow accumulation in excess of 1 per hour  freezing rain or other icing conditions  traffic congestion  emergencies  personnel illness  high winds and drifting  power failures  personnel fatigue adoption the town of enfield has adopted the winter operations snow removal and ice control policy effective  all other policies and ordinances are superceded by enactment of this snow and ice operating procedure policy all residents are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the content as it describes the condition that one might expect to encounter before during and following a winter storm event board of selectmen enfield new hampshire town of enfield winter operations snow removal and ice control procedures includes highways sidewalks parking areas and emergency service facilities equipment the public works department utilizes all available assets as needed to address snow emergencies a list of available rolling stock assets is included in the appendix a of this policy routes currently the town is divided into eight major plow andor treatment routes three of the routes encompass the town village compact area roads and are assigned to one each of the towns trucks additionally one of these trucks with 4way plow is used to maintain emergency service facilities municipal parking areas and to assist in support of trucks assigned specific routes by cleaning up of intersections the town has one 4wd utility tractor with a power angle blade and interchangeable sidewalk snow blower used for sidewalks this unit is also equipped with a spreader and dump body to carry treatment materials as needed during the event as noted in appendix a available rolling stock there are some backup units that are not utilized unless needed during an event appendix b manpower the town of enfield has ten 10 fulltime personnel and 4 fulltime backup personnel assigned to its winter maintenance operations materials the department uses approximately 1600 tons of rock salt and 5000 cubic yards of sand each season the sand is used as an abrasive and is applied to the road to improve motor vehicles traction the department utilizes salt as a deicing and antiicing agent which utilization is also referred to as chemical treatment some salt may be applied prior to a storm event dependant upon projected accumulation to get ahead of an on coming storm event and potentially deter the call in activation the entire supply of sand is purchased each year and stockpiled at the public works facility on lockehaven road a stockpile is also located at the shedd street facility for the public to utilize for their own personal private non commercial use the material is stockpiled and stored with a trace amount approximately 1 3% concentration salt to help keep it from freezing rock salt is purchased from a chosen supplier on an as needed on call basis a limited quantity of approximately 40 tons is stockpiled at the shedd street facility under cover in the enclosed shed due to volume constraints we cannot store all of our winter treatment material at one time and utilize the on call chosen supplier for treatment chemicals weather conditions require a different approach to winter maintenance route treatment with different mixture concentrations of sand and salt unless you live on a gravel road then the stocked sand is the only treatment this is done because the application of high concentrations of salt to gravel roads would cause the frozen roads to prematurely thaw creating a muddy unmanageable mess the mixture is applied to the roadway where traffic can work the mix traveling either way the mixture in conjunction with traffic action creates a watery brine melting snow andor ice and resisting snow and ice packing on the roadway this process is accelerated at the end of the storm on the last pass by a final scraping and the use of a higher concentration application the road crown further assists with the spreading of the mixture brine the sandsalt mixture is only effective to approximately 20 degrees fahrenheit other deicing agents are effective to lower temperatures but cost and need for specialized equipment have forestalled their use to this time communications the majority of the public works rolling stock is equipped with low band radios capable of transmitting and receiving on a frequency of  command vehicle radios are equipped with multiple broadcasts and receive frequencies these frequencies allow us to communicate with in and adjacent town emergency public work services in the event that mutual aid is needed in a neighboring town the command vehicles have the ability to also communicate with them each plow and equipment operator is assigned a unique call number a copy of the current call numbers is included in appendix b to this policy radios are also maintained at the public works facility whitney hall police department and fire departments parking the town has enacted a parking ban effective  this ban prohibits parking within the town of enfield and is included in appendix c with all state of new hampshire rsas associated with public way maintenance the purpose of parking bans is to allow maintenance crews unobstructed snow removal and ice control routes as much as possible to maintain the maximum effectiveness of their efforts and prevent the possibility of bodily injury and property damage plow route priorities with a total of 59 miles of roads which calculates out to 118 lane miles from which to remove snow and control ice for the traveling publics safety the public works department has to assign priorities for winter maintenance route activities in order to maximize the utilization and effectiveness of their efforts for the public a school bus routes while school is scheduled in session will be given the first priority during school days each plow route will ensure that the best possible snow clearance will be completed within one hour ahead of the bus route time b the business district will be maintained as possible during business hours with the main snow clearance effort to be done between the hours from 9 pm to 7 am of the evening following the event public safety is a very great concern in this area due to cars and pedestrians c public parking areas at the rear of the town offices all municipal facilities huse park and the boat landing parking lots will be maintained by plowing during the winter storm the application of slip resistant materials will be applied after the storm as determined to be needed by the director of public works andor highway supervisor andor facility care taker d transfer stationrecycle center transfer station personnel shall be required to assist with the towns general winter maintenance operations if the facility is open during the snow or ice storm personnel will plow this area prior to opening for public use and allow access to other public works equipment to maintain a passable facility during a storm event public areas shall be kept as clear as possible to provide as safe an access as reasonably possible sand and other slip resistant materials shall be used in public areas it often will not be possible to maintain clear ground but a reasonable effort will be made during storm events in the event of heavy icing there is a sand container there on site and the highway truck will pass its route should the intensity of the storm reach a point of unmaintainability the department may close the facility at the discretion of the public works director e fire hydrants fire department personnel shall clear hydrants as soon as possible after a storm event f each specific plow route is listed in appendix d of this policy roads areas and sidewalks not receiving winter maintenance the town of enfield does not maintain a number of roadways as part of its ongoing winter maintenance activities the areas not maintained by the town include a town roads classified as class vi roads b

the responsibility of the school district g routes 4 & 4a are both maintained by the new hampshire department of transportation however it is the towns responsibility to maintain the sidewalks along these routes salt free areas the town of enfield has established the following roadways or portion of roadways as salt free areas to protect drinking water resources or other natural resources which is believed to have been damaged in the past due to roadway salt a salt free area is one in which the municipality has determined it will not use salt as part of its ice control efforts for winter maintenance the town will post the area to warn traveling motorists that they are in a salt free area a gravel roads will not be treated with salt in a concentration higher than what it is mixed with for storage at any time to prevent the frozen gravel travel surfaces from melting b at this time the town has not designated any reduced salt treatment areas should it be chosen to do so the department will have to delineate and post these areas to warn all users that there may be a diminished treatment operation and that use may be hazardous damage to private property it should be noted that the municipality is not held responsible for damage to private property that is located within the public right of way rsa a the right of way row is often 50 wide and is often confused by property owners as their own property in most cases the row often extends 10 to 20 feet of either side of the paved or gravel road homeowner often cultivate extensions of their lawns place mailboxes erect fences or stonewalls in these areas which improves the appearance of the street greatly but is obstructive to good maintenance from being conducted on the roadway in the event of personal property damage the town of enfield will only be responsible to repair or replace damaged property having been in actual contact with the snow removal equipment that is on private property and not within the public rightofway the exception to this rule would include damage sustained to mailboxes please note that it is the homeowners responsibility to conduct maintenance around the mailbox for visibility purposes of the snow plow driver the town will accept no liability for any mailboxes that are not maintained and are not visible due to snow and ice buildup damaged mailboxes must be brought to the public works director to have physical evidence of damage verified within the first 24 hours and the town will only be held responsible for the first $25 of damage if the damage is verified by the pwd the town of enfield is not responsible for the resetting of any mailbox at no time shall any homeowner or private contractor shovel or push snow into or across a public way including sidewalks this practice is dangerous to the motoring public as well as the person performing the task it also creates a hazard in which the person or company that performed the task can be held responsible for all liability associated with incident that occurred as a result of their action plowing snow across roadways also causes maintenance problems for the crews like  plugged ditches  hard banks that cannot be shelved for future snow removal  impacts on the town equipment from hitting these hidden frozen walls post storm operations as determined by the highway supervisor the snow banks resulting from the previous accumulations shall be pushed back or shelved using the wing of the trucks or other suitable equipment to make space for future snow storms as accumulations warrant and at the discretion of the public works department we will monitor snow banks within the village areas and intersections and remove snow from these areas on an as needed basis snow removed from these areas will not occur during every event due to lack of acceptable snow dump sites that do not have an adverse effect on the environment throughout the winter culvert thawing is an ongoing post storm operation this takes a lot of time to complete not all problem culverts can be dealt with between every storm event but we try to get the worst ones first should anyone witness a frozen culvert that appears to be causing a problem or having an adverse effect they should notify the department at their earliest convenience sidewalk snow removal the department shall start sidewalk maintenance and treatment as soon as dispatched to proceed with winter storm operations as long as the following are met a sidewalk snow clearance will not begin until d all other snow removal operations are manned and in progress d if there are insufficient personnel available to conduct sidewalk snow removal operations as well as street and road clearance the streets and roads will take priority b the sidewalks will be treated as quickly possible after the storm if pedestrians or vehicles cause obstructions to the sidewalk snow removal operations the towns winter maintenance operators are encouraged to request their cooperation otherwise the operator is expected to call the police for assistance and removal of the obstruction the operator is cautioned to avoid confrontation at all possible costs appendix a rsas & xx transportation chapter 231 cities towns and village district highways liability of municipalities c 90 duty of town after notice of insufficiency  i whenever any

division of land in violation had been subdivided by conveyance to a bona fide purchaser for value b the violation was not an outcome of ignorance of the law or ordinance failure to inquire obfuscation misrepresentation or bad faith on the part of any owner owners agent or representative but was instead caused by either a good faith error in measurement or calculation made by an owner or owners agent or by an error in ordinance interpretation or applicability made by a municipal official in the process of issuing a permit over which that official had authority  c the physical or dimensional violation does not constitute a public or private nuisance nor diminish the value of other property in the area nor interfere with or adversely affect any present or permissible future
