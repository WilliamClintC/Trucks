alabama 197  11191111924 11451114511 11521115284 and 419166 authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the mayor and city council of the city of opp alabama does ordain as follows art 1  a 11209 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city of opp alabama are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities art 1  b 11209 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  2 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  3 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion  4 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and 5 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters art 1
