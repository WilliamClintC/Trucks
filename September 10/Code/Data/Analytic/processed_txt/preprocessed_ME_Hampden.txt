are insufficient to prevent serious public harm that could result from the unregulated development of properties with multiple registered caregivers  and 6 the municipality intends to draft and adopt

rightofway of hampdens public streets for convenience and practicality mailbox installations are allowed within the rightofway of maines public highways  however such installations have two conditions 1 the mailbox must be installed in accordance with applicable standards see attachment to ensure that mail can be delivered and that the mailbox does not create an obstacle or safety hazard to those that use or maintain the highway and 2 the mailbox is installed entirely at the owners risk in other words if the mailbox incurs damage during any sort of highway operations or maintenance the property owner is not entitled to replacement or compensation in fact if the mailbox was not installed in accordance with the applicable standards as stated above the owner may be held liable for injuries or damages that may have been incurred as a result mailbox design and installation standards are available from several sources and mailbox owners are expected to consult this information prior to undertaking any mailbox installation or replacement the following standards have nationwide relevance and were developed in cooperation with one another  the united states postal service usps

mailbox installation standards general location whenever possible mailboxes should be located after your driveway opening this location placement improves visibility minimizes the amount of snow that comes off of the snow plow and improves the approach for the mail carrier the diagram below further clarifies this preferred placement mailbox support design it is best to use an extended arm type of post with a freeswinging suspended mailbox this allows snowplows to sweep near or under boxes without damage to supports and provides easy access to the boxes by carrier and customers the picture to the right shows a freeswinging suspended mailbox offset mailboxes should be set back from the edge of the shoulder  regardless of whether the shoulder is gravel or paved in other words the face of the mailbox should be at least one foot 1 back from the edge of the normally plowed surface of the highway or the face of curb greater offset distances are encouraged whenever possible to allow the mail carrier to get further out of traffic and to minimize potential damage to your mailbox the following picture shows a mailbox with a reasonable offset height according to usps standards a mailbox must be installed with the bottom of the mailbox located between 41 and 45 high above the surface of the highway shoulder we recommend that this height be closer to the 45 measurement to minimize conflict with the height of the plow truck wing when snow is being pushed back during or between winter storms the picture to the right further clarifies the height considerations post size type and embedment mailbox posts must be sturdy enough to hold up the mailbox in all types of weather conditions however they cannot be so rugged that they present a hazard to vehicles that inadvertently leave the road if a mailbox support is struck by a vehicle it must easily break away therefore the following types of posts are acceptable  4 x 4 wooden posts embedded 2 feet into the ground larger wooden posts may be used only if the post is drilled an appropriate spade bit to create a shear plane that is no higher than 6 above the surface of the surrounding ground the number and size of the drilled holes depends upon what is necessary to bring the crosssection of the larger post down to the equivalent crosssectional area of a standard 4 x 4 post mainedot standard specification 60606  1 to 2 round diameter steel or aluminum pipe or standard uchannel post embedded 2 feet into the ground  unacceptable mailbox supports include anything that is filled with concrete masonry and stone structures

discharged to the potw  federal categorical pretreatment standards the categorical pretreatment standards found at title 40 of the federal regulations subchapter n parts 405 are incorporated herein by reference these standards must be adhered to by dischargers to or users of the potw 1 when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the town convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the town the town may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in a c below a to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must  employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit   currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment   provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions   not have daily flow rates production levels or pollution levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and town of hampden maine sewer have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits b an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must  maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits   continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous flow monitoring device   continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the town whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20% from its baseline production rates determined in upon notification of a revised production rate the town will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and  continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to 1a so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit c when developing equivalent mass limit the town  will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor   upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and  may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to the industrial user must also be in compliance the prohibition of bypass 2 once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed as per this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived 3 any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the town within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the town of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the longterm average production rate  local limits 1 limits for certain pollutants will be established to protect against passinterference no person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the instantaneous maximum allowable discharge limits as identified on

toxicity etc the town will provide advanced written notice of new local limits to users prior to initiating enforcement actions 3 the discharge local limits must be met at the point where the users wastewater is discharged to the potw all concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless otherwise indicated on the wastewater discharge permit the town may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of concentrationbased limitations 4 the town may develop best management practices bmps and massbased limits by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits to implement local limits and any other general discharge prohibitions as regulated in  towns right of revision the town reserves the right to establish by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits

prohibitions in this the specific prohibitions in 3 18 and 20 of this it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause passinterference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the passinterference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the town was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements  bypass 1 for the purposes of this the following terms shall have the meanings indicated bypass  the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a users treatment facility severe property damage  any substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production 2 a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections 3 and 4 3 notice a if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the town at least 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible b a user shall submit oral notice to the town of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment

insurance a contractor must present a certificate showing proof of liability insurance before a permit will be issued for construction of building sewers sewer extensions or disposal of private sewage article 8 town of hampden industrialcommercial enforcement response purpose the purpose of this plan is to document a well defined legally defensible sequence of steps to be followed when dealing with industrial users who are out of compliance with the town of hampdens industrial pretreatment program and sewer formal enforcement actions will help to resolve any confusion between the town and its industrial users as to consequences of onetime repeated or continuing noncompliance and are intended to ensure equitable treatment of industrial users epa regulations require the town to take specific enforcement action against industrial users found to be in significant noncompliance with the pretreatment requirements of this enforcement response plan defines the conditions under which the town must cite a user for significant non compliance and lists appropriate enforcement measures to remedy such situations epa guidelines also require that the selected enforcement response be appropriate to the extent of the pretreatment program violation while a telephone call to the industry might be appropriate for a late submission a more severe response is needed for a more serious violation which for example might result in an upset of the wastewater treatment plant caused by an industrial discharge this epa guideline based enforcement response plan will consider the following criteria when assessing the appropriateness of a particular response a magnitude of the violation  b duration of the violation  c effect of the violation on the receiving water  d effect of the violation on the treatment plant e compliance history of the industrial user  f good faith efforts on the part of the industrial user  and g degree of the industrial users responsibility for the violation town of hampden maine sewer 2 significant noncompliance epa requires the town to identify industrial users that are in significant noncompliance snc with the requirements of the federally mandated pretreatment program regulations users found to be in snc are subject to enforcement action by the town and to public notification of the violations once per year in the newspaper federal regulations define significant noncompliance as violations which meet at least one of the following criteria  chronic violations sixty six percent 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six month period exceed by any magnitude a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits as defined in of the sewer technical review criteria trc violations thirty three percent 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits as defined in of the sewer by the applicable criteria 14 for bod tss fats oil and grease and 12 for all other pollutants except ph  any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by daily maximum longterm average instantaneous limit or narrative standard that the town or pretreatment coordinator determines has caused alone or in combination with other discharges interference or passincluding endangering the health of potw personnel or the general public as defined by of the sewer any discharge of a pollutant that caused imminent danger to human health including the health of the towns or citys potw personnel or to the environment or has required an exercise of the towns emergency authority to halt the discharge under 40 cfr 4038f2vib  failure to meet within ninety 90 days of the scheduled date a compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction completing construction or attaining final compliance  failure to provide within thirty 30 days after the due date any required reports including baseline monitoring reports reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines periodic selfmonitoring reports and reports on compliance schedules  failure to accurately report any noncompliance with permit requirements  any other violation or group of violations which may include a violation of best management practices which the town determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the towns pretreatment program 83 selection of enforcement responses table 1 attached to this an enforcement response guide based on epa recommended response measures for varying degrees of permit violations the guide will be used by the town to determine appropriate measures in the event of a violation of the towns pretreatment program andor sewer of appropriate enforcement response will be based on the following steps  the town will locate the type of noncompliance in the first column 1 of the response guide town of hampden maine sewer  using column two 2 the town will identify the most accurate description of the nature of the violation  the town will assess the appropriateness of the recommended responses in column three 3 first time offenders or those demonstrating good faith progress may merit a more lenient response similarly repeat or frequent offenders or those demonstrating negligence may require a more stringent response furthermore the town will judge the violation by seven 7 additional criteria 1 magnitude generally an isolated instance of noncompliance can be addressed with an informal response or notice of violation nov however since even an isolated violation could threaten human health andor the environment the treatment plant damage public and private property or threaten the integrity of the towns or bangors pretreatment program ie falsifying a selfmonitoring report all instances of significant noncompliance will be responded to with an administrative order ao which requires a return to compliance by a specific deadline 2 duration violations regardless of severity which continue over prolonged periods of time will subject the violator to escalated enforcement actions minor violations which are chronic in nature are one form of significant noncompliance and will be dealt with use of aos 3 effects to the receiving water any violation which causes environmental harm will be met at a minimum with an ao and a fine environmental harm will be presumed whenever an industrial discharge a passes treatment plant  b is directly responsible for causing a violation of the town of hampden npdesmepdes permit including its water quality standards  or c has a toxic effect upon the receiving waters such as fish kill in addition the response will be designed to recover any npdesmepdes fines paid by the town which are the result of the industrys discharge violation 4 effects on the potw any violation having a negative impact on the treatment plant andor collection system such as increased treatment costs harm to personnel or equipment pipe corrosion etc which hinders the operation of the treatment plant or collections system  andor which contaminates the treatment plants sludge thereby reducing sludge disposal options will be met with a fine of civil penalty as well as the recovery of additional costs and expenses involved 5 compliance history of the user a pattern of recurring violations of any program requirements may indicate either that the users treatment system is inadequate or that the user has taken a lackadaisical approach to operating and maintaining its treatment system these indications should alert the town to the likelihood of future significant noncompliance accordingly stronger enforcement responses should be applied against users exhibiting consistent compliance problems than against those with only an occasional problem 6 good faith of the user generally a users demonstrated willingness to comply should predispose the town to select one of the less stringent enforcement actions specified provided the violation has not caused serious treatment plant upset or resulted in environmental damage however good faith does not eliminate the necessity of enforcement action and compliance with previous enforcement orders should not necessarily be considered good faith town of hampden maine sewer 7 responsibility of the user although industrial users should always be held accountable for their violations some consideration should be given to whether the violation was the result of an unforeseeable accident was preventable or was intentional on the part of the user this will affect the enforcement response selection by the town from the range of responses provided  column four 4 designates personnel responsible for the action  the town will document in writing to the user the rationale for selecting the particular enforcement response applied  the town will apply the enforcement response to the violator the town will specify the corrective action or other response required by the user including response time limits  the town will document any users responses and the resolution of noncompliance  the town will follow up with escalated enforcement action if a users response is not received within thirty 30 days or sooner if appropriate or severe violations continue  the town normally will issue an nov to the violator as a first step in enforcement proceedings however the town may elect to bypass this procedure in favor of an ao when it appears that the violation requires immediate remedial action enforcement response plan definitions ao administrative

constructed under a nonconforming structure the structure and new foundation must be placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the officer ceo basing his decision on the criteria specified in c3 relocation below 3 relocation a nonconforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the officer and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of state law and the state of maine subsurface wastewater disposal rules rules or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said rules in no case may a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be more nonconforming in determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the officer will consider the size of the lot the slope of the land effective dec 4 2019 town of hampden maine shoreland zoning  the potential for soil erosion the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties the location of the septic system and other onsite soils suitable for septic systems and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation when it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure the officer will require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation in accordance with q in addition the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation replanting will be required as follows a trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree three feet in height for every tree removed if more than five trees are planted no one species of tree can make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland than the trees that were removed other woody and herbaceous vegetation and ground cover that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be reestablished an area at least the same size as the area where vegetation andor ground cover was disturbed damaged or removed must be reestablished within the setback area the vegetation andor ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation andor ground cover that was disturbed destroyed or removed b where feasible when a structure is relocated on a parcel the original location of the structure must be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses shrubs trees or a combination thereof 4 reconstruction or replacement any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed or damaged or destroyed regardless of the cause by more than 50% of the market value of the structure before such damage destruction or removal may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained within 12 months of the date of said damage destruction or removal and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the water body tributary stream or wetland setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the officer in accordance with the purposes of this structure can be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its nonconformity if the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it cannot be any larger than the original structure except as allowed pursuant to c1 above as determined by the nonconforming footprint of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location if the total footprint of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure can be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure when it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure vegetation must be replanted in accordance with c3 above any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value or damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the market value of the structure excluding normal maintenance and repair may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained from the officer within one year of such damage destruction or removal effective dec 4 2019 town of hampden maine shoreland zoning  in determining

of hampden the municipality makes the following findings i the maine medical use of marijuana act the act codified in the maine revised statutes in title 22 c authorized registered primary caregivers to possess cultivate and transfer medical marijuana to qualifying patients as those terms are defined by 22 mrs  2422  and 2 on  the maine legislature enacted pl 201 c 452 ld 1539 an act to amend maines medical marijuana law which revised the term registered primary caregiver to registered caregiver and which includes express authorization for registered caregivers to operate retail stores for the sale of harvested medical marijuana to qualifying patients  and 3 on  the maine legislature enacted as emergency legislation pl 201 c 447 ld 239 an act to amend the maine medical marijuana law which expressly recognizes municipal home rule authority to regulate registered caregiver operations  and  4 the unregulated location and operation of medical marijuana retail stores within the municipality raises legitimate and substantial questions about the impact of such activity on the municipality including questions as to compatibility with existing land uses and developments in the municipality  the sufficiency of municipal infrastructure to accommodate such activity  and the possibility of unlawful sale of medical marijuana and medical marijuana products  and 5 as a result of the foregoing issues the location and operation of medical marijuana retail stores within the municipality have potentially serious implications for the health safety and welfare of the municipality and its residents  and 6 the municipality currently has no regulations governing medical marijuana retail stores and existing ordinances are insufficient to prevent serious public harm that could result from the unregulated development of medical marijuana retail stores  and 7 an overburdening of public facilities and resources including public safety resources is a reasonably foreseeable result of the unregulated location and operation of medical marijuana retail stores in the municipality  and 8 in the judgment of the legislative body of the municipality the foregoing findings and conclusions constitute an emergency within the meaning of 30a mrs  4356 requiring immediate legislative action now therefore pursuant to 30a mrs be it ordained by the municipality as follows

constructed under a nonconforming structure the structure and new foundation must be placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the officer ceo basing his decision on the criteria specified in c3 relocation below 3 relocation a nonconforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the officer and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of state law and the state of maine subsurface wastewater disposal rules rules or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said rules in no case may a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be more nonconforming in determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the officer will consider the size of the lot the slope of the land effective dec 4 2019 town of hampden maine shoreland zoning  the potential for soil erosion the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties the location of the septic system and other onsite soils suitable for septic systems and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation when it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure the officer will require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation in accordance with q in addition the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation replanting will be required as follows a trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree three feet in height for every tree removed if more than five trees are planted no one species of tree can make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland than the trees that were removed other woody and herbaceous vegetation and ground cover that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be reestablished an area at least the same size as the area where vegetation andor ground cover was disturbed damaged or removed must be reestablished within the setback area the vegetation andor ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation andor ground cover that was disturbed destroyed or removed b where feasible when a structure is relocated on a parcel the original location of the structure must be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses shrubs trees or a combination thereof 4 reconstruction or replacement any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed or damaged or destroyed regardless of the cause by more than 50% of the market value of the structure before such damage destruction or removal may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained within 12 months of the date of said damage destruction or removal and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the water body tributary stream or wetland setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the officer in accordance with the purposes of this structure can be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its nonconformity if the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it cannot be any larger than the original structure except as allowed pursuant to c1 above as determined by the nonconforming footprint of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location if the total footprint of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure can be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure when it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure vegetation must be replanted in accordance with c3 above any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value or damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the market value of the structure excluding normal maintenance and repair may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained from the officer within one year of such damage destruction or removal effective dec 4 2019 town of hampden maine shoreland zoning  in determining
