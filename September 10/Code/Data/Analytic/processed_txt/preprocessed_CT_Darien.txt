rnbd is a collection of approximately 77 lots many of which were created in accordance with a 1926 map that was filed in the darien land records as map #341 all of these properties are in the private association known as the noroton bay homeowners association there are other properties that are within the immediate area of this district which have a lot size of one acre or more and therefore are not included in this district streets and storm drainage systems in the neighborhood are privately owned and maintained about twenty eight of the seventy seven lots were originally created with a size of approximately eightthousand to eightthousand four hundred square feet or a little more than onesixth of an acre houses are now constructed on a variety of lot sizes including single lots consisting of about 8000 to 8400 square feet  double lots consisting of about 16000 to 16800 square feet  and other varying sizes ranging up to the one plus acres owned by the noroton yacht club from the time that zoning was first established in darien in 1925 until 194 the portion of noroton bay generally outlined in this rnbd zone was in the b residence zone allowing nine families per acre this area was treated separately and distinctly from the adjacent a or aa residence zones which extended from nearwater lanebrush island road northward and southward to pratt island and nash island in 194 this distinct area of the bay was rezoned to aaa allowing one family per acre ie oneacre minimum lot size thereby rezoning it to be the same as the adjacent areas to the north and south in 195 the aaa zone was changed to r1 which has been in effect until this rezoning during the ensuing years from 195 many variance applications were received for proposed construction of additions to existing residences or replacement residences because virtually none of the lots in this neighborhood complied with the oneacre minimum lot size lot width or lot depth requirements of the r1 zone none of the structures complied fully with all of the building setback and yard requirements enactment of flood damage prevention regulations has required many structures to be elevated as substantial renovations or new construction was proposed the flood damage prevention regulations require that the lowest floor including basement be at least one foot above the expected flood level the flood level is generally one to three feet above the existing ground level in late october 201 a storm affected many houses in noroton bay resulting in flood damage to many of the residential structures and the noroton yacht club in december 201 fema noted that new flood insurance rate maps firm would take effect in mid2013 this would result in most of noroton bay which is now in the ae elevation 10 or ae elevation 11 zones to become ae elevation 14 thus requiring additional elevation of any first floor finished space this modified fema mapping affects almost every house within this zoning district some of the waterfront properties are currently in the ve14 flood zone and will not be impacted by the proposed new firm basements are not permitted within the flood hazard zones the commission wants to encourage property owners to comply with all of the flood damage prevention requirements because of the unique nature of this zone with relatively small lots and all structures within a flood zone which flood zone elevation is generally four feet or more higher than page iv10 the adjacent streets special provisions are included exempting the first six inches of eave and up to twenty square feet of stair landingstoop overhangs from building coverage making it easier for property owners to elevate their house to meet applicable fema standards in the noroton bay district zone the properties and circumstances of this neighborhood are extremely different from the other properties in the r1 zone both to the north and south of this district  the neighborhood has a unique character  lot sizes within this area of noroton bay vary dramatically oftentimes with small lots adjacent to much larger lots  and all of the properties are within the flood hazard zone the purposes of the rnbd zone are to create more practical and logical regulations that will allow for the reasonable use of properties without the need for variances  and where possible readaptation of the houses in the neighborhood while still protecting this neighborhoods character and the other purposes outlined in of the darien zoning regulations amended  412 permitted principal uses permitted principal uses in this zone

the 2 5 10 25 and 50 year storms page iv13 municipal use overlay zone added   amended  421 background and purposes the municipal use overlay zone is an overlay zone which is intended to provide greater flexibility for municipal uses or for uses that are generally conducted by or provided by the town of darien to serve a public purpose these uses frequently are a one of a kind use in the town  such as the town hall the public works garage the firefighting training facility the middle school the high school the darien library the senior center the darien police station the ems headquarters and garage while others have more than one facility in the town but are dispersed in different areas of the community  such as the three fire stations the public elementary schools public housing as well as buildings and facilities in the public parks and beaches in a municipality that is more than ninetypercent developed it is nearly impossible to find undeveloped parcels for municipal uses or uses serving a public purpose the application of current regulations frequently limits or precludes the expansion of existing uses to meet future growth requirements for example in the residential zones a 30 foot maximum building height applies to most municipal and public use buildings including the darien town hall the darien police department the noroton and noroton heights the volunteer fire departments the volunteer ems service and all public schools those uses located in the commercial zones are subject to even more restrictive building height limitations of 25 feet or 28 feet these requirements restrict necessary growth encourage footprint sprawl increase building costs and decrease available open space the intent of this municipal use overlay zone is to permit flexibility in building height parking and buffer requirements primarily to permit vertical expansion in lieu of expansion of building and structural footprints such flexibility shall be granted only where the commission determines the appropriateness of a particular location for the zone and only after special permit approval of the specific use and facility not all municipal existing or proposed uses or properties will be appropriate for the municipal use overlay zone but the creation and placement of the mu zone provides for greater flexibility for the town to provide essential services to the community while still protecting the high quality of development and character of the town and protecting the properties in proximity to municipal facilities 422 principal uses requiring special permit the following uses may be permitted subject to approval of a special permit in accordance with then a zoning permit in accordance with the standards set forth below a municipal buildings structures and uses including facilities of the darien board of education b buildings structures and uses that serve a public purpose not including uses carried on primarily for profit that would normally be constructed by and or operated by the municipality but which are under the auspices of a quasimunicipal entity such as the darien library inc or post 53 ems service or one of the three privately operated volunteer fire departments page iv14 423 permitted accessory uses requiring special permit the following uses may be permitted subject to approval of a special permit in accordance

located in the same or less restrictive underlying zone as the proposed use and the commission determines that the placement of the building andor mechanical equipment such as air conditioning units relative to the property line will not be detrimental to the reasonable use and value of the adjacent property b in addition the commission may authorize a basement or two floors below ground level to be completely finished habitable space without those areas being counted as a story maximum building height as defined by may be increased to 40 feet andor 3 stories above ground andor 45 feet from the average grade to the page iv15 highest point of the roof provided either 1 all of the setbacks for the entire building are increased to at least two times the minimum requirement  or 2 the commission finds that the unique use and design of the building combined with the location of the site and the development plan will result in a project that will be appropriate for the community and the site specific circumstances and will not be detrimental to the reasonable use and values of the adjacent properties amended    425 special controls a necessary lighting of parking areas shall be permitted but there shall be no unshadedunshielded light sources and lights shall be so located that their beams are not directed into neighboring residential lots or onto an adjacent street due to the unique nature of the uses and the fact that many of the facilities will serve more than one function or use and because it is not unusual for such facilities to be the location of special events the number of onsite parking spaces shall be subject to a determination by the commission regarding the adequacy of such parking for most activities and events to take place on the site b reasonable

approval in accordance with in general the 25 foot minimum buffer from all property lines to all special permit buildings parking areas and other active use areas shall be maintained but the commission may authorize the reduction or elimination of the buffer size in certain specific circumstances where they determine that it would be impossible andor inappropriate to establish andor maintain such buffers and the commission determines that the reduction of the buffer size will not have an unreasonable detrimental impact upon the adjacent property or properties e the municipal use mu zone shall be applied as an overlay zone that keeps the existing underlying zone in place and thus provides the property owner with an option to use and develop the site in accordance with the regulations of the existing zone or to utilize the flexibility of the mu zone any structures andor facilities developed in accordance with the municipal use overlay zone are for the specific use as authorized and might not be easily adaptable for conversion to other uses once the municipal use has been discontinued page iv16 active senior residential overlay zone added  431 background and purposes housing for active senior empty nesters is an important element of residential development within the town such housing enables older residents to continue to reside in town by living in specially designed singlefamily residences the active senior residential overlay zone allows the development of such dwellings by permitting increased density on larger parcels in the r1 zone while preserving the singlefamily residential character of the surrounding area increased density on larger lots combined with strict limitations on building coverage and height provides opportunities for active senior housing developments approved pursuant to this comply with the requirements of the federal fair housing act 42 usc  36003620 and similar state statutes eg cgs 46a64b 46a64c that pertain

register and the national flood insurance program as amended it is the finding of the commission and the environmental protection commission that the flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation which may result or might possibly result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in flood plains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damages it is therefore the purpose of these regulations to protect the citizens of darien by making provisions for the preservation protection

page intentionally left blank page d1 appendix d  planning & zoning commssion policies and procedures regarding filing of notice violation in the darien land records recent court decisions have upheld the authority of towns to file a notice of zoning violation in the land records to protect the interests of those persons who may be financing purchasing or leasing the property the planning and zoning commission wishes to amend the zoning regulations to specifically permit such enforcement practices and to establish a policy to have such notices filed in the land records whenever appropriate and to establish a procedure which is fair to the property owner the practice of filing notices in the land records is discretionary and would not be appropriate in every situation in which there is a zoning violation it remains incumbent on anyone interested in the property to check with the zoning enforcement officer and other town officials to determine if there is a violation on the property it should not be assumed that if there is not a notice of violation in the land records that there is no violation the filing of the notice in the land records would not preclude the sale lease or financing of the property but at least it would advise other persons of the problems and violations the following policies allow for a notice of violation to be filed in the land records and it is required that a notice of the release be filed in the land records when the situation is corrected the procedure is as follows 1 the zoning enforcement officer has issued a cease and desist order and the owner of the property andor tenant andor violator have failed to comply with said order 2 the ownertenantviolator have failed to appeal the cease and desist order to the zoning board of appeals or the zoning board of appeals has upheld the order or portion of the order 3 the zoning enforcement officer or director of planning and zoning shall place the intent to file a notice of violation in the land records on the agenda of the zoning board of appeals for discussion notice of time date and place of the zoning board of appeals meeting shall be mailed to the ownertenantviolator by certified mail return receipt requested at least seven 7 days prior to the meeting the ownertenantviolator of the property shall be given an opportunity to appear before the zoning board of appeals and show cause why a notice of zoning violation should not be filed in the land records 4 the zoning board of appeals may authorize in writing the filing of the notice of zoning violation in the darien land records 5 if the director of planning and zoning andor the zoning enforcement officer are aware of a situation where time is of the essence such as a pending sale lease financing or refinancing of the property they are authorized to file a notice of zoning violation in the land records prior to a discussion with the zoning board of appeals so long as a proceeding is conducted by the zoning board of appeals within thirty days of the filing of the notice 6 when the violations have been corrected and all fines andor penalties have been paid in full the zoning enforcement officer shall file a notice of release of zoning violation in the darien land records if the ownertenantviolator requests that the notice of release be filed but the zoning enforcement officer decides that the property is still in violation of the zoning page d2 regulations or the cease and desist order then the ownertenantviolator may appeal that decision to the zoning board of appeals as per of the darien zoning regulations page e1 appendix e  examples of inclusionary zoning calculations a calculating the number of units required 1 example nine lot subdivision the total number of onsite units proposed is nine 9 the number of affordable units required 9 x 12%   108 all of which must be affordable to households at 80% of state median income smi 100% x 108   108 since only one unit is required the 108 rounds down to 10 the remaining 08 units would have to be fulfilled via fee in lieu at the 80% level standard 008 x $90600 x 225%   $16308 2 example nine multifamily units to be constructed the total number of onsite units proposed is nine 9 the number of affordable units required 9 x 12%   108 the number of units required to be affordable to households at 80% of state median income smi 100% x 108   108 since only one unit is required the 108 rounds down to 10 that unit shall be at the 80% smi level the commission could grant up to 4 additional units as a bonus 12 of 9 rounded down provided that these units meet a 25% affordability standard  now there are 13 units the number of affordable units required 9 x 12%   108 25% of the 4 bonus units will need to be affordable   100 now there are two required affordable units at the 80% smi level with the remainder being a feeinlieu calculated as the number of units required to be affordable to households at 80% of state median income 100 x 08 08 the state median income for a family of four is $90600 2015 the cash contribution is calculated as follows 008 x $90600 x 300%   $21744 see next page for another calculation example b calculating the fee in lieu payment the cash contribution provided for each dwelling unit or fraction thereof shall be as follows 1 units affordable to households earning 80 percent of the state median income smi for the state of connecticut require a cash contribution equal to 300% of the state median income for a family of four 2 example cash contribution based on 2015 data the total number of onsite units proposed is five 5 the number of affordable units required 5 x 12%   06 the number of units required to be affordable to households at 80% of state median income 100% x 06   06 page e2 the state median income for a family of four is $90600 2015 the cash contribution is calculated as follows 06 x $90600 x 300%   $163080 the total fee in lieu payment is $163080 note as of the adoption of this regulation the 2015 state median income data was the most recent available as time changes this data will change the most recent data from hud at the time the application is filed shall be used for

et seq of the darien zoning regulations the purpose of these regulations is to require storm water management plans for certain projects and applications the regulations define the applicability of the new establishes components of stormwater management plans the commission also proposes to amend the darien subdivision regulations by adding to a new #8 requiring that all subdivisions shall comply with the requirements for stormwater management as outlined within et seq of the darien zoning regulations 2 these proposals to amend the subdivision regulations and the zoning regulations are put forth by the planning and zoning commission consistent with the  stormwater management report and draft regulations prepared by tighe & bond planning and zoning commission adopted resolution amendments to the zoning regulations and subdivision regulations regarding stormwater regulations   3 these proposals have been revised compared to the original proposal dated  that original proposal was presented at the january 2009 public hearing in response to comments received at that public hearing department staff worked with town counsel and local professional engineers in revising the proposal the revised proposal dated  was put forth 4 at the public hearing on this matter craig flaherty a professional engineer explained amounts of rainfall which comprise storm events he noted that in recent years an increase in local rainfall depths has modified what comprises a 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 year storm in connecticut we are experiencing more rainfall than in the past and that must be considered in analyzing what comprises these storms he noted that the university of connecticut recently published the document rainfall in connecticut which estimates rainfall depths over a 24 hour period using data early 1990s this more recent data from reflects a trend of increasing precipitation that has been observed in connecticut 5 a letter of support of this application was received from the state of connecticut dep dated  the darien environmental protection commission sent comments dated  the southwestern regional planning agency swrpa in a letter dated  noted that the proposed amendments do not appear to pose intermunicipal impacts 6 at the april public hearing staff noted that comments were received regarding the proposal also at that hearing the commission heard from a professional engineer and local attorney they suggested modifications to the proposed waiver provision of the zoning regulations the commission also noted at that time that the burden of demonstrating the appropriateness of the requested waiver should be on the applicant not on the commission 7 discussion also focused on whether studying and requiring drainage systems to attenuate the 100 year design storm is appropriate using the newer more accurate numbers of how much rain falls during a 100 year design storm is substantially greater than the amount of rain fall that must be accommodated using the old data for a 50 year design storm the commission finds that because of higher rainfalls and the new storm sizes that studying and possibly designing for 100 year design storms is not appropriate and shall not be required the commission believes that the new more accurate data should be utilized and that a 50 year design storm using the new data should be the minimum standard to which the drainage systems are designed 8 details regarding the design standards and methods of analysis are contained within the department of public works drainage manual the dpw drainage manual must be updated to reflect the comments and policies of the planning & zoning commission thus the commission will establish an effective date of  to allow the department of public works to modify their manual accordingly 9 the applicable recommendations in the 2006 town plan of conservation & development as previously amended are as follows planning and zoning commission adopted resolution
