relief 1224101 purpose the purpose of the landscaping standards are to promote aesthetically pleasing commercial light industrial and business park developments  to protect property values planting of vegetation screening and landscaping materials specifically these standards are intended to reduce excessive heat glare and accumulation of dust  to provide privacy from noise and visual intrusions  and to prevent the erosion of soil and excessive runoff of drainage water 1224102 landscaping required no plans for any building structure or change in land use or other improvements shall be approved by the planning commission unless there shall also have been submitted landscaped plans to the planning commission which plans are signed and stamped by a licensed professional landscape architect landscaping in accordance with the plans submitted must be installed within 30 days or otherwise approved by the city planner as seasonal conditions may dictate in such cases the ownerdevelopers shall bond for such landscape improvements to insure that installation is completed as submitted and approved 1224103 parking lot screening open parking spaces except in onefamily and twofamily residential projects in any zone district shall be screened from view from adjacent properties and streets to an eventual minimum height of three 3 feet by the use of berms andor plantings a minimum of twothirds 23 of the affected street frontage or property boundarynot counting intersecting drivewaysmust have the required screen structures such as decorative walls or fences may be approved if the planning commission finds that 1 the structures avoid a blank and monotonous appearance by such means as architectural articulation and the planting of vines shrubs or trees or a the total use of berms andor plantings is not physically feasible or b the structures attractively compliment the use of berms andor plantings the maximum spacing of plants to achieve an acceptable screen and the maximum acceptable grades for screening areassuch as sodded berms and planting beds shall be consistent with the requirements of this ithe shrubs used as a parking lot screen shall substantially conform to the types and spacings provided in appendix a of this in general the reference elevation for the base of the required screen shall be the surface of the parking area space that is to be screened 2 the following maximum grades shall be conformed to in the parking lot screen area a sodded berms  3 feet horizontal 1 foot vertical b planting beds  these standards may be applied to other planting areas as well 1224104 parking lot trees one 1 tree of a type suitable for parking lots shall be provided for every fifteen 15 open not in garage vehicular parking stalls in parking lots with fifteen 15 or more stalls the tree types and minimum planter sizes shall be consistent with the requirements of this required trees may be clustered but shall be located to divide and break up expanses of paving and long rows of parking stalls and to create a canopy effect in the parking lot in order to be considered within the parking lot the trees must be located in planters that are bounded on at least three 3 sides by parking lot paving this means that only trees in landscaped islands or fingers can count toward the parking lot tree requirement planters shall be of sufficient size and design to accommodate the growth of the trees and to prevent damage to the trees by vehicles policies athe trees used as the required parking lot trees shall substantially conform to the types marked in appendix a of this city recognizes that trees in addition to those marked in appendix a may be approved in a parking area if special conditions exist for example a a relatively small proportion of deciduous ornamental trees may be approved if a ratio of trees to parking spaces greater than the minimum requirement is provided b coniferous evergreen trees may be approved if such trees are planted in areas which exceed the minimum recommended planter size and if vehicular visibility is not a problem 1 the minimum size of parking lot planters shall substantially conform to the details provided in appendix b figures 1 and 2 2 the required parking lot trees shall be located within the parking lot area which is essentially where vehicles park and maneuver and excludes other landscaping areas 3 the city recognizes that parking lot trees have the greatest beneficial impact in relatively large parking lots such as in shopping centers the city recognizes that relatively small parking lots or parking lot subareas for example a maximum of 30 parking stalls with one aisle may not significantly benefit from trees within the parking area however in such cases the required parking lot trees should be provided adjacent to the parking area in conjunction with other required trees to provide visual relief and shading examples an example showing parking lot trees in an area determined to be the parking lot area is provided in figure #2 1224105 landscaped setbacks required minimum landscaped setbacks are required in all zone districts onefamily and twofamily residential projects in any zone district are excluded b minimum depth of landscaped setback 1 adjacent to an expressway or freeway on the citys master street plan25 2 adjacent to arterial on the citys master street plan20 3 adjacent to any nonarterial street10 4 adjacent to a nonstreet boundary of the zone district no minimum depth requirement however must provide for required nonstreet boundary trees discussed below or may need to provide buffer requirements discussed in if applicable c minimum number of trees in landscaped setbacks and nonstreet boundaries 1 adjacent to an expressway or freeway on the citys master street plana minimum of one 1 tree for every twenty feet 20 of frontage of the property within the zone district 2 adjacent to an arterial on the citys master street plana minimum of one 1 tree for every twentyfive feet 25 of frontage of the property within the zone district 3 adjacent to any nonarterial streeta minimum of one 1 tree for every thirty feet 30 of frontage of the property within the zone district 4 adjacent to any nonstreet interior boundarya minimum of one 1 tree for every thirty feet 30 of nonstreet interior boundary of the property within the zone district these trees do not need to be located in a landscaped setback of a minimum size but shall be in planters of sufficient size and design to accommodate the growth of the trees and to prevent damage to the trees by vehicles the planter specifications shall be consistent with the requirements of this these required landscaped setback and boundary trees may be clustered along a particular frontage or boundary the trees shall be selected from the list of tree types that are commonly known to grow in the area listed in appendix a 6 the required landscaped setback trees may be located in a landscaped setback with a depth greater than the minimum required depth  however in any case the required trees shall be located within fifty feet 50 of the street side property line the required boundary trees shall be located within fifty feet 50 of the nonstreet interior boundary of the zone districts 7 the required landscaped setback trees may be permitted to be located in part or in total in the adjacent public rightofway area if 1 approved by the planning commission 2 the district engineer approves the trees in the case of a state highway and 3 no conflicts exist with utility easements 8 the required landscaped setback trees shall be located in the adjacent public rightofway area or parkway if these trees cannot be placed in the landscaped setback area due to the existing development of the site however such trees are required only to the extent that 1 approval is granted by the planning commission 2 the district engineer approves the trees in the case of a state highway and 3 no conflicts exist within utility easements 9 walls and fences which are 25% or more opaque in design shall be no higher than three feet 3 above finish grade in required landscaped setback opaque walls and fences higher than three feet such as noise barriers must be located outside of the landscaped setback to maintain a landscaped appearance along the street policies athe city recognizes the need for flexibility in the development of some relatively small sites on a lot with a net size excluding adjacent public streets of less than one 1 acre the landscaped setback may be approved at less than required depth on up to onehalf 12 of the street frontage if the average depth of the landscaped setback complies with the required depth 1 the trees used as required landscaped setback trees may be any of the types which are commonly known to grow in the city area see list in appendix a relief may be granted to the minimum number of trees in an arterial street setback if the setback is planted with large deciduous shade trees the number of such trees however should not be less than one tree per 40 of frontage 2 relief may be granted for retaining walls higher than three feet 3 in a required landscaped setback where special grading conditions exist such retaining walls shall be visually softened by plantings of trees shrubs and vines 3 relief may be granted to waive nonstreet interior boundary trees if the subject boundary is located within a common parking lot planned for two adjoining districts parking lot trees would be required however 4 public sidewalks may be permitted to meander into a required landscaped setback area if landscaping is provided and maintained in the rightofway to adequately compensate for the loss of landscaping in the setback area examples an example showing the landscaped setbacks and trees that may be required in a project is provided in figure #3 a copy of the citys master street plan is provided in the appendix 1224106 buffers b buffer between nonresidential and residential projects separated by a nonarterial street 1 where required such a buffer is required along the streetside property line in any nonresidential project in any zone district where such a project is separated from a residential district by a nonarterial street nonarterial streets are those not designated as arterial streets on the citys master street plan public alleys are considered nonarterial streets for the purposes of this subsection 2 design standards such a buffer shall be a minimum of fifteen feet 15 in depth the minimum number of trees in such a buffer shall be one 1 tree for every fifteen feet 15 of the frontage length of the buffer a minimum of onethird 13 of the trees shall be evergreen trees these requirements may effectively increase the depth and number of trees of the minimum required landscaped setback this buffer area shall require a ground covering with a minimum of 75% in living plant materials c buffer between 1 adjacent nonresidential and residential projects and 2 adjacent multifamily residential and singlefamilytwofamily residential projects such a buffer is required in the following situations 1 along the common property line in any nonresidential project in any zone district where such a project is adjacent to any residential zone district 2 along the common property line in any multifamily project a project with three or more dwelling units in one building in any zone where such a project is adjacent to a onefamily or twofamily zone district d design standards such a buffer shall be a minimum of fifteen feet 15 in depth the minimum number of trees in such a buffer shall be one 1 tree for every fifteen feet 15 of the length of the buffer a minimum of onethird 13 of the trees shall be evergreen trees this type of buffer is not required to consist of a minimum percentage in ground covering by living materials however that portion of the buffer area in a ground covering by nonliving materials shall be covered with bark wood chips rock stone or similar materials the planning commission may approve a buffer design of lesser standards where it is shown that characteristics of the property make it unfeasible to meet the standards set forth above e policies 1 the trees used as required buffer trees may be selected from the types which are commonly known to grow in the city area see list in appendix a a concentration of small ornamental trees with open branching and foliage and relatively slow growth is discouraged however 2 the city recognizes that the actual uses of the land may vary greatly along a required buffer between a nonresidential project and a residential project the storefronts service docks parking areas or landscaped spaces of a nonresidential project may face the dwelling entries private patios parking areas or landscaped spaces of a residential project the minimum standards of the buffer may be approved to vary to reflect the varying interface of the uses for example an opaque fence or wall may be required between two properties if greater impacts are expected f examples an example of a required buffer is provided in figure #4 1224107 required internal landscaping a purpose internal landscaping requirements are intended to augment the boundary landscaping requirements such as landscaped setbacks and buffers and parking lot landscaping requirements the purpose of internal landscaping is to visually soften the mass of buildings and to visually separate building areas from parking areas the city recognizes that flexibility in the design of spaces and tree selection is needed this flexibility is needed because of 1 the diversity of building designs 2 the possible limitations on plant selections due to building foundation problems posed by the root growth of some trees and 3 building foundation problems posed by the irrigation of expansive soils these requirements do not apply to onefamily and twofamily residential projects in any zone district 1 requirements for multifamily projects a project with three or more dwelling units in one building in any zone district a minimum internal landscaping area a minimum of fifteen percent 15% of the sites net area sites area excluding adjacent public streets b minimum internal landscaping area a minimum of one 1 tree for every 500 square feet of the required minimum internal landscaping area 2 requirements for nonresidential projects in any zone district a minimum internal landscaping area a minimum of five percent 5% of the sites net area sites area excluding adjacent public streets b minimum number of trees in the internal landscaping area a minimum of one 1 tree for every 500 square feet of the required minimum internal landscaping area up to one half 12 of the required trees may be substituted by shrubs adjacent to retail storefronts where the view of wall signs may be obstructed ten 10 shrubs with a minimum container size of five 5 gallons shall be provided for each tree that is replaced 3 standards for the minimum internal landscaping area and minimum number of trees location of the minimum area to be credited toward the minimum internal landscaping area requirement a landscaping area shall be located as follows a adjacent to those building elevations which form the major public views of the project from adjacent streets and properties and to the users of the project or b within a plaza or courtyard between buildings or portions of buildings or c in a space provided to separate building areas from parking spaces areas or d in a similar location in which substantially conforms to the stated purpose of the required internal landscaping area see above if approved by the planning commission the location of spaces credited toward the minimum internal landscaping area requirement shall be consistent with the requirements of this minimum internal landscaping area and its minimum number of trees may not consist of spaces or trees which are proposed to meet the minimum requirements of other sections of this such as landscaped setbacks buffers or parking lot trees b design standards the minimum required internal landscaping area shall consist of a minimum of fifty percent 50% in ground covering by living grass or other plant materials this percentage provides flexibility where plants and their irrigation should be limited next to building foundations the intent of the internal landscaping area is to provide relief from structures and hard surfaces in a project use of plantings therefore sidewalks which provide basic pedestrian circulation only shall not be credited toward the minimum internal landscaping area requirement paved plazas may be credited to a maximum of fifty percent 50% of the required internal landscaping area if such plazas have trees which provide visual relief to those building elevations which form the major public views of the project to provide for flexibility of design in the minimum internal landscaping area the developer may select the types of and the planting spaces between the required trees however the trees shall be selected from the tree types that are commonly known to grow in the city area listed in appendix a the planting spacing should allow for the growth characteristics of the trees without adversely affecting the maintenance of structures walks or drives the minimum planting sizes of trees shall comply with the specifications provided in c policies 1 parking lot landscaped spaces and tree planters with a ground covering by living materials may be approved by the planning commission to be credited to a maximum of onehalf of the required internal landscaping area if the following conditions exist the provided number of trees meets the required number of parking lot trees and internal landscaping area trees these landscaped spaces or tree planters serve the purpose of providing desirable pedestrian oriented landscaped spaces within the interior of the project or visually softening the mass of the buildings the planning commission can justify such a credit because parking lot planters are not otherwise required to have a ground covering by living materials 2 that portion of a landscaped setback which is in excess of the minimum depth may be approved by the planning commission to be credited toward the required internal landscaping area however such portion should be within 50 feet of the projects buildings and should have trees which provide visual relief to those building elevations which form the major public views of the project 3 each building area within a development plan with multiple building areas is not required to meet the 5% internal landscaping requirement as long as the entire development plan complies with the internal landscaping requirement the internal landscaping should be generally distributed among the building areas with an emphasis near those building elevations which form the major public views of the project d examples 1 an example of internal landscaping and trees in a project is provided in figure #5 1224108 percentage of ground cover in living materials unless otherwise specified any required landscape areasuch as a minimum landscaped setbackshall consist of a minimum of seventyfive percent 75% in ground covering by living grass or other plant materials the minimum planting sizes and spacings of shrubs and ground covers to meet a ground covering requirement shall be consistent with requirements at this foliage crown of trees shall not be used in the seventyfive percent 75% or other required percentage calculation the remaining twentyfive percent 25% of the required landscape area may be covered with bark wood chips rock stone or other similar materials acceptable to the planning commission policies aplantings of shrubs and ground covers to be considered a ground cover of living materials shall substantially comply with the planting sizes and spacings in appendix a of this the spacing between two plants with different spacing requirements shall be an approximate average of two spacing requirements 2 wildflowers where proposed to fulfill a ground covering requirement should be combined with native grasses the sole use of wildflowers in a minimum required area is discouraged especially where a relatively low level of irrigation is proposed because of the relatively high chance of bare areas specifications should be provided as to how the seeds are to be planted and the amount of grass seeds to be used such as ounces per 1000 square feet or pounds per acre 1224109 percentage of tree sizes the total number of trees required per site shall have the following percentage of tree sizes a20% large trees and shrubs in a combination of deciduous trees with a caliper greater than 3 inches and evergreen trees with a height greater than 8 feet 1 50% medium trees and shrubs in a combination of deciduous trees with a caliper of 2 inches to 3 inches and evergreen trees to a height from 5 to 8 feet 2 30% small trees and shrubs in a combination of deciduous trees with a caliper of 112 inches to 2 inches and evergreen trees to a height of 4 feet 1224110 irrigation all required landscaped areas shall have an automatic subsurface sprinkler irrigation system installed where city culinary water is being used for irrigation purposes back flow devices shall be installed according to the city requirements 1224111 assurances for installation and completion prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any structure where landscaping is required except when a certificate of occupancy is obtained by providing acceptable assurance to the city guaranteeing the completion of such landscaping all work as indicated on the landscaping plan shall be inspected and approved by the city planner at the time of inspection the city planner shall check the quantities and locations of landscape materials at the time of such inspection the owner shall warrant that the completed landscaping complies with the approved landscape plan such warranty shall include the quantities locations species and sizes of plants and other landscape materials on the approved landscape plan in the event that an inspection is not conducted by the city planner prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy because acceptable assurance has been provided to the city guaranteeing the completion of such landscaping such inspection shall be done by the city planner subsequent to the installation of such landscaping but prior to the release or expiration of the acceptable assurance a landowner may obtain a certificate of occupancy for a structure prior to the completion of required landscaping work if the completion is not possible due to seasonal or weather conditions and if the owner submits the necessary assurances with the city planner for the completion of the landscaping the acceptable assurance guaranteeing the completion of the landscaping may be an irrevocable letter of credit cash bond or satisfactory subdivision bond and shall be equal to the cost of the landscaping work and shall be accompanied by a written assurance that such landscaping will be completed to the satisfaction of the city planner within a specified period of time not to exceed nine 9 months from the date of occupancy policies athe city must approve the form of a financial assurance for the installation and completion of landscaping 1 where seeding is permitted a letter of credit or bond shall not be released until the seeding is considered to be established in a healthy state by the city planner 2 examples of the letter of credit and subdivision bond forms are available at the city offices 1224112 nonconforming uses and development plans a purpose and intent within the districts created by the adoption of this or by the adoption of amendments subsequent to this there may exist developments of land including parking areas and landscaping which were legal prior to the adoption or amendment of this but which under the terms of this its amendments are now prohibited restricted or regulated it is the intent of this permit these nonconformities to continue until they are voluntarily removed or brought into compliance in conjunction with a proposed change in the development it is intended that these nonconformities will not be enlarged expanded or increased except as provided in this title it is recognized that conformance with landscaping requirements may have special problems related to the existing improvements and the scale of a proposed change to a project b continuation landscaping of parking spaces not in conformity with the requirements of this where such landscaping of parking spaces lawfully existed at the time such requirements became effective may be continued except as otherwise provided in this title c extension nonconforming landscaping of parking spaces shall not be enlarged expanded extended or increased except as provided in this d proposals which require conformance 1 nonconforming in terms of offstreet parking adequate offstreet parking is necessary for the general safety and convenience of city residents and to avoid congestion on public streets required parking spaces shall be provided in conjunction with any addition of building floor area or a change of use which requires additional parking spaces 2 nonconforming in terms of landscaping landscaping is important in improving the overall appearance of the city and increasing the compatibility of different land uses it is recognized that landscaping is difficult to install in conjunction with relativelysmall increments of change in a development project such as relativelysmall building additions or changes of use for the following reasons 1 the landscaping elements of a development project should be planned in a comprehensive and coordinated manner which is not feasible to implement with relativelysmall increments of change 2 nonconformities related to landscaping are difficult to resolve where the existing improvements limit the potential for a comprehensive landscaping plan to be implemented and 3 fragmented ownership in a development project can further reduce the potential for a comprehensive landscaping plan to be implemented with relativelysmall increments of change the existing nonconforming landscaping of a development project is permitted to continue until one of the following changes occurs 1 any new construction or addition of building floor area consisting of 50% or more of the existing gross building floor area of the development project on the subject lot or 2 any change from a residential use to a nonresidential use or vice versa consisting of 50% or more of the existing gross building floor area of the development project on the subject lot all required landscaping shall be provided in conjunction with either of the two changes described above all required landscaping shall be provided in conjunction with any new development of a vacant lot or with the redevelopment demolition and new construction of a lot e policies 1 development proposals which constitute a relativelylarge increment of change ie 50% or more of the existing building floor area should allow for nonconformities due to landscaping to be eliminated or at least minimized relief may be appropriate where the existing development of the site does not allow for all of the current landscape requirements to be met in reviewing a request for relief the planning commission or other planning department designee has the authority to evaluate whatever the beneficial aspects resulting from a proposed change outweigh the beneficial aspects of the existing development 2 the previous approval of a development planor approved sketch planconcept planwhich is not in conformity with current landscape requirements but which was in conformity with the requirements in effect at the time of approval shall remain valid unless the following change occurs the addition or relocation of building floor area consisting of 50% or more of the existing gross building floor area currently approved on the development plan for the subject development project all current landscaping requirements shall be met if the above change is proposed a proposed change consisting of less floor area than described above shall not require the development plan be revised to conform with current landscape requirements 1224113 prohibition of elms the planting of elms is prohibited because most elms possess more negative qualities than positive qualities the negative qualities include disease proneness weak branches suckering and uncontrollable spread of seeds these negative qualities lead to excessively high public and private maintenance costs 1224114 limitations on certain trees within 25 of rights of way the planting of box elder salix and most populous trees are limited near rightsofway because of their invasive roots which cause problems with utilities and streets and partly because of their weak branches 1224115 screening of loading docks vehicle repair bays and vehicle fueling areas from view from adjacent properties and streets such required screening may not be necessary in all land use situations for example it is not necessary to screen a loading dock on one industrial property in favor of the view from a loading dock on an adjacent industrial property if there are no other public views of the loading dock 1224116 administrative relief a purpose and intent the purpose of this to provide for the flexibility and the applications of regulations where a standard is inapplicable or inappropriate to a specific use or design proposal the city recognizes the specific landscape requirements in this do not anticipate all possible landscape situations in addition the city recognizes that there may be landscape proposes which conform to the purpose intent and objectives of the landscape regulations that were not anticipated in the specific regulations in addition the city recognizes that a proposed development of a relatively small commercial or industrial lot which was created prior to the current landscape requirements such as lots of one acre or less may present unusual difficulties in complying with the current requirements b application a written request for administrative relief shall be submitted in conjunction with the development proposal pursuant to the zoning such as a site plan or conditional use permit the written request shall include a justification in terms of the findings necessary to grant administrative relief c findings necessary to grant administrative relief the planning commission must make all of the following findings in order to grant administrative relief 1 the strict application of the regulation in question is unreasonable given the development proposal or the measures proposed by the applicant or that the property has extraordinary or exceptional physical conditions that do not generally exist in nearby properties in the same zoning district and such conditions will not allow reasonable use of the property in its current zone in the absence of relief 2 the intent of the zoning chapter and the specific regulation in question is preserved 3 the granting of administrative relief will not result in an adverse impact on surrounding properties d appeal a decision of the planning commission may be appealed to the city council within 10 days after the decision the appeal shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of applications to the city planner and shall include a written statement of the grounds of the appeal the reasonable development of a site may require the granting of relief to some or all of the requirements although all the categories of landscape requirements are considered important the planning commission generally assigns the following priorities for compliance with landscape requirements 1 adjacent residential uses should be buffered 2 an attractive appearance of the project should be provided along adjacent streets by landscaped setbacks and trees 3 the building elevations and parking areas which form the major public views of the project should be visually softened and enhanced by trees and other plantings chapter 1225
