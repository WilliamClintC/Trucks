construction periods  b cost savings early contractor input during the design process is expected to contribute to significant cost savings value engineering building systems analysis life cycle costing analysis and construction planning may be considered that lead to cost savings any special factors influencing this analysis should be considered including high rates of inflation market uncertainty due to material and labor fluctuations or scarcities and the need for specialized construction expertise due to technical challenges  or c technical complexity the public improvement

rate based on some other unit of measure eg number of pumps acres etc added   amd sept 7 2000  amd jan 18 2007  amd dec 20 2012  purpose of system development charge this ordinance establishes system development charges for capital improvements to the arterial and collector street system in accordance with ors  to  the premise upon which the street system development charge ssdc is based is that each new development should provide to the arterial and collector street system an additional amount of capacity representative of the demand that it will cause and that the charge to the developer will be representative of the cost of that additional capacity in actual practice the rates will be set lower than the amounts needed to fund all the needs generated by development these charges will provide a significant portion of the funding needed for capital improvements and each developer will pay a fair share it is assumed that in most cases direct construction of arterial or collector streets by a developer will not be necessary in those cases where a developer does have to construct or improve arterial or collector streets within or outside the development as a condition of development approval the developer will receive a credit against the system development charge the ssdc is an improvement fee as defined in ors  since the charge to the developer is for costs associated with capital improvements to be constructed it is assumed that all traffic generators in the city impact the entire arterial and collector system and all ssdcs are calculated on the same basis regardless of the location of the development the reasons for this assumption are 1 the city is fairly compact in size 2 there are no significant barriers to traffic flow 3 major traffic attractors such as downtown medford center and rogue valley mall are centrally located 4 residential generators are dispersed throughout the city and the surrounding area and 5 there is no factual basis for breaking the city into smaller street improvement districts added   amd   repealed aug 18 2011 repealed  establishment of the street system development charge 1 there is hereby established a charge to be levied within the city to be known as the street system development charge ssdc which shall be collected at the time of increased usage of the arterial and collector street system no building permit shall be issued after the effective date of this section unless the ssdc for the development for which the permit will be issued has been paid in full as used in this section development means construction erection or placement on a site of a building structure mobile home park pad golf course public park or the construction of any addition to or enlargement of any of the foregoing development does not include setup of a mobile home on an existing pad in a mobile home park when a change in use of a building which was subject to the ssdc when constructed results in increased usage of the arterial and collector street system the occupant whose activities cause the increased usage shall be charged for the new use less a credit equal to the amount of the ssdc which was paid for the prior use no charge for change of use shall be made after 3 years from the date the certificate of occupancy was issued for the building no one shall be charged a ssdc on account of any home occupation as defined in of this 2 the applicant for a building permit or business license shall be required to state in writing the intended use of the building in sufficient detail to enable the city engineer to determine the appropriate category of use if the use of a building changes or if the stated use is incorrect the occupant shall report the change of use to the city engineer within 30 days and promptly pay any additional ssdc that may be due if any occupant subject to the ssdc fails to report an incorrect statement of use or a change of use within 30 days or fails to pay the additional ssdc within 10 days after invoice the occupant shall pay a penalty of 10% of the balance due plus interest on the unpaid balance at the rate of 15% per month 3 at the time

the issuance of the required permit an applicant may elect to use the alternate fee calculation method of determining the trip generation rate for the type of development proposed this election must be by written application to the city engineer and must be accompanied with payment of the street sdc fee using the standard methodology and values found in table 31 3 if the developer or customer elects to use the alternate fee calculation and if the tripgeneration rates resulting from the independent traffic study are at least twentyfive 25 percent higher or lower than the tripgeneration rates found in table 31 table of values for determining attributable new travel for the appropriate categoryofuse for street sdc fee or table 41 ite bundles and formulas for determining tripends for

values shall be used 4 in order to be used to calculate the street sdc for a proposed development or street utility fee using the alternate fee calculation method the independent traffic study must meet the following standards unless the citys traffic engineer modifies them because of unique circumstances a the completed study must be stamped by either a licensed traffic engineer or a licensed civil engineer qualified to conduct traffic studies who has been approved by the citys traffic engineer prior to beginning the study if a civil engineer is selected a signed and stamped statement of qualifications signifying their ability to perform such studies shall be required the citys approval shall not be unreasonably withheld b all calculations shall be based on the average weekday traffic on the adjacent street for a general type of development similar to the proposed and not on the average weekday traffic on the development site itself the purpose of the study is to determine what a typical development like the one proposed will generate in trips after it has become an established entity in the community traffic counts shall be at least 12hour counts c a minimum of five local sites with comparable land use shall be used for the study and approved by the citys traffic engineer if in the sole discretion of the citys traffic engineer there are insufficient local sites the traffic engineer will consider alternate sites within the states of idaho oregon or washington the sites shall all have land uses that are of comparable general description to that of the proposed development when it is completed and in use d the traffic study shall be designed in accordance with the methodology described in the institute of transportation engineers trip generation manual current edition e the request to use the alternate calculation shall include a detailed description and drawing of the proposed development site a description and drawing of each sampling site a description of why these sites are representative of the impact likely to be generated by the proposed development and such other information as may be required by the citys traffic engineer f the completed report of the study shall be in a form approved by the citys traffic engineer and upon its completion shall be submitted to the citys traffic engineer for approval 5 the citys traffic engineer may approve approve with conditions or reject the trip generation rate calculated in the report prepared under paragraph 4 above the city traffic engineer shall approve the report if it conforms to generally accepted principles of traffic engineering upon approval the trip rate for the proposed development shall be used to calculate the street sdc except as described in paragraph 3 above in the event that the alternate calculation results in a street sdc which is less than that derived from the standard calculation upon approval of the alternate calculation by the city traffic engineer the city shall refund to the applicant the excess street sdc collected or reduce the amount the applicant agreed to pay if the approved alternate calculation results in a street sdc greater than the standard calculation the applicant shall pay the difference to the city in the event the applicant fails to promptly pay the difference to the city the city may suspend the permit for the development or take other collection action until payment is made in the event the alternative calculation results in a revised street utility fee refunds or additional charges shall be made in accordance with adjustment of bills for billing error added   amd   amd sept 7 2000  amd aug 18 2011  amd dec 20 2012  principles of classification 1 definitions a sic manual standard industrial classification manual 1987 edition published by executive office of the president  office of management and budget b establishment an establishment is an economic unit generally at a single physical location where business is conducted or where services or industrial operations are performed c auxiliary establishment an establishment which is primarily engaged in performing management or support services for other establishments of the same company according to the sic manual it is to be treated as a separate establishment only if it is located at a separate site examples of activities that might be considered auxiliary are management and other general administrative functions such as accounting data processing and legal services  research development and testing  and warehousing 2 classifying in assigning categoriesofuse during the building permit process the following principles shall be used as a guide a classifications shall be made according to the 1987 edition of the standard industrial classification manual as much as possible exceptions to this are outlined in the foregoing definitions other factors such as zoning may also affect the classification b each building permit is to be classified according to the primary activity of the establishment that will or does occupy the building or site to determine the primary activity of an establishment selling both retail and wholesale goods the relative number of sales to general public customers shall be used rather than the volume of sales dollars c where distinct and separate economic activities are performed at a single physical location or in a single building each activity may be treated as a separate establishment and therefore may be classified separately i split use within a building shall be determined on the basis of the nature of the business rather than any particular use of floor space within the building for examplea managers office or bookkeepers office within a retail store shall not provide a basis for splitting the use of that building into retail and professional service that office is an integral part of the business and the business is a retail business not a professional office or service the entire floor area shall be considered to be retail for purposes of calculating the street sdc fees ii another aspect to consider is whether different aspects of the same business which are housed within the same building could stand alone as businesses of their own for example les schwab and other tire stores sell tires batteries etcretail items and this is a major part of their business but they also do a lot of service workinstallation flat repair brake work alignments etc this is also a large part of their business either one of these could stand alone ie does not need the other aspect of the business to function this should be a necessary test when determining whether to allow split use for a particular business iii buildings which house two or more separate businesses may be allowed to use different categories of use a retail store and an insurance office in the same building would allow a split use of retail and professional service even though they are housed in the same building the key difference between this situation and that in paragraph i above is that there are two distinct and separate businesses here again the focus needs to be on the nature of the entire business and not incremental divisions of floor space within the building d separate buildings of a single establishment business at a single physical location may be classified separately if they fall under the sic manual definition of auxiliary establishment see definition in 1cexamples of auxiliary establishments are found on pages 14 15 and 17 of the sic manual an auxiliary establishment may occasionally be considered for separate classification even though it is physically connected to the primary operating establishment but only if the employment is significant for both the auxiliary and the primary activity of the auxiliary serves other establishments of the same company e building complexes such as strip malls etc where more than 50000 sq feet  are contained under one roof and where the businesses are primarily retail shall be considered to be all retail no sdc fees will be charged when one space goes vacant and then fills again 3 appealsany person dissatisfied with the categoryofuse assigned to his or her project may appeal such classification to the city council by filing a written notice of appeal with the city recorder any time after the person is informed of the classification but not later than 10 days after payment of the ssdc the decision of the city council in these matters shall be based on the primary nature of the establishment and not by the amount of traffic generated by it the primary nature of an establishment shall be determined by the principles of classification found in 1 and 2 of the the definitions of the categoriesofuse found in the by the council shall be used for the ssdc fee categoriesofuse added   amd sept 7 2000  amd nov 4 2004  amd aug 18 2011  amd dec 20 2012  explanation of ssdc methodology this section explains and defines the method of calculating the ssdc 1 travel the relevant travel by landuse type and unit is calculated by multiplying the number of trip ends per day adt times the average trip length the result is then reduced to onehalf to adjust the number of trip ends to the number of travel trips a travel trip say from home to work would have two tripends one leaving home and one arriving at work but would count as only one trip the individual factors in this calculation and their sources are a vehicular trip ends per day the values shown in table 31 for average daily travel adt in tripends per day are based upon available data from published and unpublished sources rates have been adjusted to reflect percentagesofnew trips for each land use b average trip lengths the values for average trip lengths are based upon available data from published and unpublished sources in calculating ssdcs for developments that do not have direct access to an arterial or collector street the average trip length shall be reduced by 20% to account for the portion of the average trip that uses lowerorder streets having direct access means the first public street rightofway that one enters after leaving the property in question if a development takes direct access onto two public streets of different classification the street of the highest order shall be used to determine the average trip length 2 required new lane miles this is calculated by dividing the attributable new miles of daily travel by the capacity of a lane of roadway 3 construction cost the number of lanemiles of new roads as discussed above is multiplied by the construction cost per lanemile of road 4 right of way cost the right of way cost equals the number of lane miles required multiplied by the right of way cost per lanemile 5 credit for land and improvements a if land is required to be deeded or dedicated to the city for collector or arterial street rightofway as a condition of development approval the developer shall receive compensation by credit for that exaction as described in 5c below credits for rightofway shall be equal to the value of such land on the date of the final order of either the planning commission or the site plan and architectural commission whichever occurs first and includes the condition for the dedication said value will be determined by the real market value last recorded on the tax assessors records for the parcel being developed or the value indicated by an appraisal by a licensed fee appraiser selected by the city if the developer agrees to pay for the appraisal and deposits the estimated cost in advance the tax assessors value shall be used unless a written request to have the land value determined via appraisal is submitted to the city engineer within 60 calendar days of said final order the appraisal shall determine the value of the parent parcel prior to project influence and shall be done in accordance with accepted methods used in the industry for establishing the value of public rightofway the rightofway cost factor used to compute the ssdc will not be considered in determining the amount of credit land required to be deeded to the city for any other classification of streets other than collector or arterial will be deemed to be for the developers benefit and will not be compensated for by credits b where it is a condition of development approval that the developer either provide in part or in its entirety a street improvement or traffic device that provides additional total capacity to collector or arterial streets of the city the developer will receive compensation by credit for the reasonable cost as described in cie below of that additional capacity as described in c below unless the need for the improvement is specifically attributable to that development if for his convenience the developer wishes to provide a greater facility than required or wishes to construct a facility prior to the time that the city ordinarily would the city at its sole discretion may elect to participate but shall not be required to do so the credits provided by this paragraph apply to both onsite and offsite improvements c ia all ssdc credits for eligible land dedications and street improvements will be paid in cash in accordance with the parameters identified below all cash payments will be approved administratively per applicable expense authority limits of the citys contracting and purchasing code for those developments whose credit period began see 5ciii below prior to  payments shall be made to the entity applying for the building permit unless a written agreement already existed prior to  between the developer who constructed the improvements or dedicated the rightofway and the city for those developments whose credit period begins after  payments shall be made to the developer who constructs the improvements or dedicates the rightofway unless otherwise provided for in a written agreement between said developer and the city such an agreement is also subject to the restrictions of b payment of credits for residential land divisionsthe total credit allowed for a single or multifamily residential land division development shall be calculated following the construction of the improvements or following the recording of final plat whichever comes later and will be prorated across the number of dwelling units to be constructed in said development the proration for a single or multifamily development will be based on the ratio of the chargeable trips for each dwelling unit to the total chargeable trips for the entire development using the numbers in table 31 located at the end of this chapter cash payment shall be made as each building permit is issued the maximum credit to be allocated to each individual dwelling unit shall be no more than the value of the corresponding ssdc fee which will be due for that same dwelling unit at the time the total credit value for the development is calculated credits in excess of the ssdc fees to be generated from such a development shall be paid in cash upon recording of the final plat c payment of credits for nonresidential land divisionscredits for commercial and industrial land divisions shall be calculated at the same point in the review process as those for residential land divisions cash payments shall be made as each building permit fee is paid which has a ssdc fee as part of said building permit the cash payment resulting from a new building permit in a nonresidential land division shall be equal to the amount of the ssdc fee calculated for said building permit credits shall be paid out as building permits are issued on a firstcome firstserved basis until used up total credits for the development shall be reduced by the amount of each payment until 1 all parcels in the land division are fully developed 2 the credits are reduced to zero or 3 the credit period expires whichever comes first if credits remain after all parcels are developed and if the credit period has not expired the remaining credits shall be paid in cash to the developer d credits for other types of developments such as those approved by the site plan and architectural commission shall be determined after the completion of the improvements andor recording of the rightofway dedication distribution or assignment of these credits shall be in accordance with 5cia e if the developer constructed the improvements then the credit will be calculated using the same construction cost factor per lane mile used in the ssdc formula 2 regardless of the actual cost in calculating credits for rightofway exactions and assessments no credit shall be given for the time value of money ii when a change in the ssdc formula of 2 occurs street construction credits for all developments shall be applied based on the date of the first submittal of the public improvement drawings to the engineering division for review and approval street construction credits for developments whose public improvement drawings are submitted to the city for review before the effective date of the change shall be determined using the old ssdc construction cost factor those developments for which public improvement drawings are submitted on or after the effective date of the change will be credited using the new ssdc construction cost factor credits generated by rightofway dedications are not affected by the changes in the ssdc formula in 2 iii the length of the credit period for all developments shall be ten years which is the maximum allowed by ors 5d for subdivisions and land partitions the credit period shall begin with the date the final plat is recorded with the jackson county clerks office for other types of development the credit period shall begin with the date the improvements are accepted by the city plats which were recorded after  and whose credit period had been set ordinances at either three years or five years shall have their credit periods extended to ten years iv credits allowed under this subsection 5 shall be paid as building permits are issued for construction within the platted area to which the credit was assigned until the total credits for the development have been used up or the credit period has expired at the expiration of the credit period any remaining credits shall be canceled and forfeited d when a change in use of an existing building results in increased usage of the arterial and collector street system the occupant whose activities cause the increased usage shall be charged for the new use less a credit equal to the current ssdc for the prior use whether occupied or vacant and regardless of the length of the vacancy said credit shall also be subject to the conditions of refund will be given for a decrease in street usage credit may also be given for demolished or destroyed buildings previously existing on a parcel the burden of proof showing that there was a permitted building on the subject parcel and the nature of its use shall fall on the applicant no cash credits may be given for excess credits due

capital improvements to the city of medfords sanitary sewer collection system in accordance with ors  to  the premise upon which the sewer collection system development charge scsdc is based is that each new development or changes to an existing development should provide to the sanitary sewer collection system an additional amount of capacity representative of the demand that it will cause and that the charge to the developer will be representative of the cost of that additional capacity in actual practice the rates will be set lower than the amounts needed to fund all the needs generated by the development these charges will provide a significant portion of the funding needed for capital improvements to effect the impacts new development causes in the downstream sanitary sewer system and each developer will pay a fair share the scsdc is an improvement fee as defined in ors  since the charge to the developer is for costs associated with capital improvements yet to be constructed added feb 17 2000  establishment of the charge there is hereby established a charge to be levied within the city to be known as the sanitary sewer collection system development charge scsdc which shall be collected at the time of increased usage of the sanitary sewer collection system no building permit shall be issued after the effective date of this section unless the scsdc for the development for which the permit will be issued has been paid in full as used in this section development means construction erection or placement on a site of a building structure mobile home or

for the sanitary sewer collection system development charge fund and on planning criteria as identified in the report entitled city of medford sewer master plan dated april 2005 and prepared by brown and caldwell consulting engineers the current design criteria utilized by the regional wastewater treatment plant in the determination of equivalent residential units erus and as specified in the engineering report is 350gallonsdayeru average dry weather flow adwf this same design criterion of 350 gallonsdayeru will be utilized in the determination of the erus for the sanitary sewer collection system the projected cost of future system additions shall be determined on the basis of the capital improvements identified in the city of medford sewer master plan the future system additions required to serve growth will be adjusted to current dollars and divided by the number of erus for which these improvements will provide service the future costs of compliance with oregon law in the determination of sdcs shall include the estimated cost of engineering legal planning administrative and accounting services compliance costs per eru shall be determined on the basis of projected population growth the calculations shall be done on a citywide basis so that the charge reflects the cost per eru throughout the city the charge for future system addition and compliance costs shall

f belowgrade crawlspaces belowgrade crawlspaces are allowed subject to the following standards as illustrated in fema technical bulletin 1101 crawlspace construction for buildings located in special flood hazard areas 1 the building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation collapse and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads including the effects of buoyancy hydrostatic loads and the effects of buoyancy can usually be addressed required openings stated in subsection 2 below because of hydrodynamic loads crawlspace construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than five feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional such as a registered architect or professional engineer other types of foundations are recommended for these areas 2 the crawlspace is an enclosed area below the base flood elevation bfe and as such must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters the bottom of each flood vent opening can be no more than one foot above the lowest adjacent exterior grade 3 portions of the building below the bfe must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage this includes not only the foundation walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building but also any joists insulation or other materials that extend below the bfe the recommended construction practice is to elevate the bottom of joists and all insulation above bfe 4 any building utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated above bfe or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions ductwork in particular must either be placed above the bfe or sealed from floodwaters 5 the interior grade of a crawlspace below the bfe must not be more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade 6 the height of the belowgrade crawlspace measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall must not exceed four feet at any point the height limitation is the maximum allowable unsupported wall height according to the engineering analyses and building code requirements for flood hazard areas 7 there must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace the enclosed area should be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event the type of drainage system will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage characteristics such as soil types possible options include natural drainage welldrained soils and drainage systems such as perforated pipes drainage tiles or gravelcrushed stone drainage by gravity or mechanical means 8

incorporated in the mitigation design as described following a for mitigation without tree buffers the requirements of linear distance can be achieved by elements such as the following 1 manmade or natural features such as infrastructure rightsofway roads watercourses wetlands rock outcrops forested areas and steep slopes  2 nonfarmable areas of the agricultural land being buffered including yards storage areas roads and all structures  3 publicly owned land without consistent present or projected public use as determined by the public entity owner  4 an easement on agricultural land purchased by the applicant  5 other open areas except undeveloped land zoned for rural residential commercial or industrial use that are considered appropriate to the purpose of the buffer b for mitigation with tree buffers the approving authority may allow the requirements to be partially or fully satisfied by existing areas of trees and shrubs as long as their mitigation effect is essentially the same as that intended by the requirements in this the characteristics of the existing vegetation do not meet the requirements in this cannot substitute in full or in part for an adequate tree buffer then the area can either be incorporated into the design at half its mitigation value for example a 20footwide riparian area would be calculated as 10 feet of tree buffer or it can be left out of the tree buffer and be calculated at its original width 20 feet of existing vegetation would be considered as 20 feet of bare land  city of medford oregon  municipal

50 feet  the maximum required is 100 feet the buffer shall be composed of at least two different conifer species see graphic below for figure 2 2 tworow buffer as required for il option 1 and ph option 1 depending on the species used the minimum allowable tree buffer width is approximately 40 feet  the maximum required is approximately 65 feet the buffer shall be composed of at least two different conifer species 3 row spacing and offset the purpose of the rowbyrow offset is to mitigate the effect of individual tree mortality and to compensate for the individual differences between trees a threerow buffer 1 offset set off the second row by one third the spacing distance of trees st in the first row  set off the third row by another third refer to figure 2 for clarification 2 spacing of rows the distance between rows will be determined using the following formula where sr is the spacing distance between rows d1 is the widest foliage diameter of the tree species in one row

list of recommended species is available in the greater bear creek valley regional plan appendix iii available in the city of medford planning department k transitions between buffers of different intensity the principal purpose of the tree buffer is to mitigate spray drift  spray height is the primary factor in determining whether a higher or lowerintensity buffer is required to lessen the amount of spray being carried past a transition between the two types of buffer the applicant will extend the buffer 75 feet beyond the end of the higherintensity buffer as shown in figure 4 l screening shrubs 1 screening shrubs are used only in conjunction with tree buffers 2 if the first row of trees on the agricultural side of the tree buffer does not have foliage down to ground level install screening shrubs is to provide sufficient foliage cover to close the gap if the first row of trees on the agricultural side of the buffer provides foliage down to ground level then screening shrubs are not required 3 the mature height of the shrubs shall be 125 percent of the anticipated groundtofoliage bare space of the average mature specimen of tree species 4 permitted screening shrubs

may eventually be converted to urban uses  therefore a midterm buffer may be designed for eventual conversion to urban uses b midterm buffer design shall be based on the following factors 1 the most likely time period it will remain as a buffer  2 the specific use to which the buffer will likely be put to once the agricultural land is urbanized conversion to housing to roads or to recreational use for the community c alternatively the applicant may defer development of an appropriate portion of the urbanizing land bordering agricultural land until such time as the agricultural land is no longer zoned efu 2 irrigation the establishment of an irrigation system is mandatory for vegetative buffers must be designed by a licensed professional and be site and species specific as appropriate the operation and maintenance of the irrigation system must be part of the buffers overall maintenance plan contained in the maintenance covenant 3 road placement it is always preferable to not bisect buffers with roads due to the windfunneling effect they create if a road is unavoidable it should be as narrow as possible not straight and should not be oriented to the prevailing wind it should be noted that even a road with an acceptable orientation and design will permit some degree of increased spray drift to pass buffer area and will also pose a greater risk of trespass o deviations from provisions 1 a proposed mitigation area design that deviates from the provisions of this be approved by the approving authority per the process in this in order to propose a mitigation area design that deviates from the minimum standards in this the applicant is responsible for the preparation of a conflict assessment and mitigation study cams and submittal of the cams for evaluation by an

405471 a where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the wrd manager may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with d and e b when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the wrd manager may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users c when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the wrd manager shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr 4036e d when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the wrd manager the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in d1a d1e below 1 to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  c provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  d not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and e have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits 2 an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must a maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  b continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  c continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the wrd manager whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in paragraph d1c upon notification of a revised production rate the wrd manager will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and d continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraphs d1a so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit 3 when developing equivalent mass limits the wrd manager a will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  b upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and c may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to industrial user must also be in compliance with the prohibition of bypass e the wrd manager may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the wrd superintendent f once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations

enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions of this it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge would cause pass interference and that either a a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference or  b no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the treatment plant was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements 2 the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an industrial users treatment facility shall be an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against the industrial user if the user can demonstrate that such a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage in order to be eligible for the affirmative defense the industrial user must demonstrate that there was no feasible alternative to the bypass and submit notice of the bypass as required by 40 cfr 40317 the establishment of an affirmative defense under the provisions of this section does not relieve the user of liability for damages or extraordinary costs incurred by the wastewater treatment system as a result of the discharge  operating upsets any user which experiences an upset in operation which places the user in a temporary state of noncompliance with this an industrial wastewater discharge permit issued pursuant to this inform the wrd manager of the upset immediately the user shall also submit within twentyfour 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset a

operating in a prudent and workmanlike manner at the time of the upset and complied with applicable o & m procedures 3 the upset was reported in accordance with the requirement of this section noncompliance caused by operational error improperly designed pretreatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation does not constitute an upset the establishment of an affirmative defense under the provisions of this section does not relieve the user of liability for damages or extraordinary costs incurred by the wastewater treatment system because of the discharge amd dec 3 2015  bypass a for the purposes of this 1 bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a users treatment facility 2 severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural

bypass is prohibited and the wrd manager may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required under paragraph c of this section 2 the wrd manager may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its

extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in special flood hazard areas which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored cause damage in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to flood loss 3 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding in flood hazard areas by provisions designed to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruptions  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas  f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas so as to minimize blight areas caused by flooding  g notify potential buyers that the property is in a special flood hazard area  h notify those who occupy special flood hazard areas that they assume responsibility for their actions  and i participate in and maintain eligibility for flood
