sound level meter shall be located on the adjacent boundary closest to the noise source or on a lot from which the complaint arises unless otherwise specified in the noise control ordinance b if a complaint arises from a multistory structure the height of the sound level meter shall be adjusted so that it is on a direct line between the noise source and noise receiver c the microphone shall be at least three feet from any adjacent structures 2 sound level exceeded ten percent of the time a every ten seconds read the level from the sound level meter b record this level on the data sheet figure 1 as a check mark at the appropriate level c after 60 samples test by the confidence criterion discussed below if the samples meet the criterion then the measurement is complete if not then 40 more samples must be taken and the confidence test repeated if the confidence criterion is still not met additional groups of 50 samples must be completed until the confidence criterion is met d confidence criterion i counting down from the top of the data sheet and from left to right within each level circle the test samples shown in table i for instance after 60 samples have been taken then the second the sixth and the twelfth samples from the top are circled see figure 1 example 1 ii if these three test samples fall into three contiguous levels then the measurement is complete otherwise another group of samples must be taken and tested again sometimes the test samples will be even more closely packed falling into only one or two contiguous levels in these cases the criterion is also met iii if 100 or more samples have been taken skewing is allowed the two outer test samples the error limits can be shifted by one sample not one level both in the same direction see figure 1 example 2 this sometimes provides the necessary accuracy without requiring further sampling however if the criterion is still not met after skewing then 50 more samples must be taken and tested e once the confidence criterion has been met the level exceeded ten percent of the measurement period the second sample circled has been determined with db with 95 percent confidence 3 maximum sound level a as noise source radiates sound read the maximum deflection of the needle of the sound level meter b if possible determine and record the minimum sound level during the period of observation v reporting measurements 51 information the following information shall be obtained and reported for each sound measurement period 1 dimensioned sketch or photograph of the test area showing location of sound

the design of the project are as follows a stormwater runoff shall be subjected to best management practice prior to discharge into natural or artificial drainage systems best management practice shall mean a practice or combination of practices determined by the city development engineer to be the most effective practical means of preventing or reducing the amount of pollution generated by the project to a level compatible with state water quality standards found in fac ch 173 b 1 no site alteration shall cause siltation of wetlands pollution of downstream wetlands or reduce the natural retention or filtering capabilities of wetlands 2 no site alteration shall allow water to become a health hazard or contribute to the production of mosquitoes 3 all site alteration activities shall provide for such water retention and settling structures and flow attenuation devices as may be necessary to insure that the foregoing standards and requirements are met c design of water retention or detention structures and flow attenuation devices shall be subject to the approval of the city development engineer pursuant to the standards hereof detention structures shall be designed to release runoff to the downstream drainage system over a period of time so as not to exceed the capacity of the existing downstream system under no case shall open retention areas ponds etc have side slopes steeper than four horizontal to one vertical  to a depth of two feet of water at seasonal low pond elevation at which point the side slope may be increased to two horizontal to one vertical  retaining walls may be utilized to accommodate field conditions in order to maintain good water quality in stormwater management detention ponds and maximize the provision of fish and wildlife habitat stormwater management systems with permanently wet detention ponds should be designed operated and maintained so as to resemble a natural pond to the greatest extent practical a natural pond design should include a littoral zone comprised of native emergent and submersed aquatic macrophytic vegetation a deep open water limnetic zone free of rooted emergent and submersed vegetation and where feasible an upland buffer of native trees shrubs and under story vegetation in accordance with st johns river water management district requirements d a positive drainage system shall be provided which will not adversely impact downstream owners or adjacent lands e where possible natural vegetation shall be used as a component of the drainage system the water table should not be manipulated so

considered and provisions for conveyance of such runoff shall be included in the drainage plan g runoff shall be treated to remove oil and floatable solids before discharge from the site in a manner approved by the city development engineer h erosion by wind or water shall be prevented by the developer throughout the construction process i direct discharge to class ii waters is prohibited a workable filter system must be provided prior to any discharge to class ii waters j for the purpose of this division it is presumed that the lowering of the water table for the purpose of constructing detentionretention basins and for the purpose of permanently protecting road construction does not conflict with the stated objectives of this division if all of the following are met 1 the development site is not in an area known to the city based on data collected and interpreted by the us geological survey the st johns river water management district the county and other professional investigators as important to recharge or to prevention of discharge of the state aquifer 2 the proposed lowering of the water table shall be over no more than 15 percent of the site to a depth of five feet below the surface of the existing undisturbed ground or an equivalent volume said area to be measured at the overflow elevation of the retention area 3 if ditches underdrains or similar devices are used to lower the water table the lateral volumetric effect will be calculated and the volume will be deducted from that allowed for retention areas 4 the highwater table may be lowered up to two feet below the undisturbed ground in the vicinity of roads for the purpose of protecting the subbase and base of the roadway andor for the purpose of preventing mosquito production in the

wetlands within the city recognizing the rights of individual property owners to use their lands in a reasonable manner as well as the right of all citizens to protection and purity of the waters of the city and their associated wetland ecosystems it is the policy of the city to minimize the disturbance of wetlands in the city and to encourage their use only for the purposes which are compatible with their natural functions and environmental benefits wetlands contiguous to waters of the state noncontiguous and isolated wetlands serve the following important functions in the hydrologic cycle and ecological system 1 riverine wetlands and adjacent floodplain lands provide natural storage and conveyance of floodwaters 2 inland wetlands adjoining larger lakes and rivers act as barriers to waves and erosion 3 inland wetlands provide temporary storage of surface waters during times of flood thereby regulating flood elevations and the timing velocity and rate of flood discharges 4 wetlands temporarily store flood flows and reduce the velocity of floodwaters reducing erosion and facilitating the settling of suspended sediment wetland vegetation filters and detains sediment which would otherwise enter lakes and streams 5 wetlands may protect water bodies by providing settling of suspended sediments assimilation of nutrients and uptake of other natural and manmade pollutants wetland vegetation filters sediment organic matter and chemicals microorganisms utilize dissolved nutrients and break down organic matter 6 inland wetlands adjacent to rivers streams and lakes are important to freshwater fisheries as spawning grounds 7 inland wetlands provide essential breeding and predator escape habitats for many forms of mammals birds reptiles amphibians fishes and invertebrates 8 wetlands provide essential habitat for many rare endangered and threatened species 9 wetlands provide excellent recreation opportunities including but not limited to fishing hunting camping photography boating and nature observation 10 wetlands especially those in karst terrain may contribute to surface water storage and may contribute to groundwater recharge 11 forested wetlands provide an important source of forest products this renewable resource provides a significant economic benefit to the forest landowners of the city b it is further the purpose and intent of this division to ensure that there be no net loss of wetlands function and acreage as defined herein to this end a wetland alteration permit will be required as provided herein wetland identification the term wetlands shall be as defined in section 13 the landward extent of wetland delineation shall be as provided in fac ch 62340 et seq if an undeveloped area has been cleared within 180 days from the

standards for the design installation and maintenance of landscaping and by establishing standards for the development of adequate buffers between adjacent or nearby dissimilar uses within the corporate limits of the city the requirements of this section are designed to 1 improve the aesthetic appearance of the city and maintain and increase land values by requiring development to include landscaping and existing vegetation which complements the scale color texture and materials used in the development 2 promote public safety by using landscaping as an integral element of site design to define and reinforce circulation patterns and to separate vehicular and pedestrian traffic areas 3 improve environmental quality by requiring landscape materials and areas which improve air and water quality the uptake of minerals and dust  maintain permeable land areas essential to surface water management and aquifer recharge  reduce air noise heat and chemical pollution biological filtering capacities of trees and other vegetation  promote energy conservation shading of buildings and paved areas and reduce temperatures process of evapotranspiration  and conserve limited fresh water resources use of drought resistant plants mulches soil amendments and efficient irrigation systems 4 promote economic efficiency in the development of limited land resources by using landscaping to provide screening and separation of land uses of differing character and intensity which are otherwise incompatible in close proximity to one another due to visual or physical intrusions 5 provide direct and increasingly important physical and psychological benefits to human beings use of landscaping to reduce noise and glare to break up the monotony of expansive walls and paved areas and to

health safety and welfare to protect and preserve trees and enhance tree cover in the city the value of trees is many and varied and includes but is not limited to the following 1 trees are valuable producers of oxygen a necessary element to the human survival and serve to reduce the environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide concentration in the air  2 the leaves of the trees trap and filter out ash dust and pollen in the air  3 trees may reduce wind velocity and noise levels  4 trees may prevent erosion by stabilizing the soil root system and by breaking the force of raindrops pounding upon soil surfaces  5 trees reduce the quantity of surface runoff and reduce the percentages of impervious surfaces  6 trees help purify water by removing the nutrients from waters passing ground from the surface to the groundwater table  7 trees provide shade and transpire water which helps to moderate temperatures and cleanse the air  8 trees provide food shelter and essential habitat for wildlife  9
