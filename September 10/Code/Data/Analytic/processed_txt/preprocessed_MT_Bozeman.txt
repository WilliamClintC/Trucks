commission finds that 1 the protection of the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city requires that the street fire protection water and wastewater systems of the city be expanded and improved to accommodate continuing growth within the city and within those areas directly served by its fire department and within those areas connected to its water and wastewater systems 2 new residential and nonresidential development imposes increased and excessive demands upon existing city facilities 3 new development often overburdens existing public facilities and the tax revenues generated from new development often do not generate sufficient funds to provide public facilities to serve the new development 4 new development is expected to continue and will place everincreasing demands on the city to provide public facilities to serve new development 5 the creation of an equitable development impact fee system would enable the city to impose a proportionate share of the costs of required improvements to the citys transportation fire protection water and wastewater systems on those developments that create the need for them 6 all types of development that are not explicitly exempted from the provisions of this division will generate demand for citys transportation fire protection water and wastewater services or facilities that will require improvements to city facilities and equipment 7 the citys adopted impact fee studies set forth reasonable methodologies and analyses for determining the impacts of various types of development on the citys street fire protection water and wastewater systems and for determining the cost of acquiring land and the cost of acquiring or constructing facilities and equipment necessary to meet the demands for such services created by new development 8 the city establishes as city standards the assumptions and service standards referenced in the impact fee studies and other duly adopted documents as part of its current plans for the transportation system and for the citys fire protection water and wastewater systems 9 the documentation required by mca 761602 is collectively contained in the citys facility plans impact fee studies development regulations financial records capital improvements program design and specification manual and other city documents 10 the development impact fees described in this division are reasonably related to the service demands and needs of new development and are based on the impact fee studies and documentation cited in subsection 7 of this section and do not exceed the costs of acquiring additional land and the costs of acquiring or constructing additional facilities or equipment required to serve the new developments that will pay the fees 11 all transportation improvements upon which the transportation impact fees are based and upon which transportation impact fee revenues will be spent based on the limitations set forth in this division will benefit all new development in the city  and it is therefore appropriate to treat the entire city as a single service area for purposes of calculating collecting and spending the transportation impact fees while recognizing differences in the demand for service based upon the identified factors set forth in the transportation impact fee study 12 all of the fire protection improvements listed in the fire impact fee study will benefit all new development that receives fire protection service directly from the city fire department  and it is therefore appropriate to treat the entire city and all properties served directly by the city fire department as a single service area for purposes of calculating collecting and spending the fire protection impact fees 13 all of the water system improvements listed in the water impact fee study will benefit all new development that connects to the city water system  and it is therefore appropriate to treat the entire city and all properties connected to the city water system as a single service area for purposes of calculating collecting and spending the water impact fees 14 all of the wastewater system improvements listed in the wastewater impact fee study will benefit all new development that connects to the city wastewater system  and it is therefore appropriate to treat the entire city and all properties connected to the city wastewater system as a single service area for purposes of calculating collecting and spending the wastewater impact fees 15 there is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between the development impacts created by each type of development covered by this division and the development impact fees that such development will be required to pay 16 the citys facility planning capital improvement program development review and bidding processes create a public process by which on a specific and detailed basis the capacity expanding components of construction can be identified and funded distinctly from those components which are not capacity expanding by providing for evaluation by the city and the impact fee advisory committee of future needs related to growth identification of applicable funding sources and monitoring of construction and payments 17 to meet the needs of new development the city may construct capacity expanding capital improvements prior to development of adjacent properties this may include the construction of capacity expanding infrastructure of a nature and in a location that may require such improvements to be deemed project related improvements at the time of the development of such adjacent properties the city commission finds that under certain conditions it is fair and reasonable that the costs of a project related improvement that have been paid by the city prior to development of certain properties should be reimbursed at the time of development of those properties 18 this division creates a system by which development impact fees paid by new developments will be used to expand or improve the city transportation fire protection water and wastewater systems in ways that benefit the development that paid each fee within a reasonable period of time after the fee is paid 19 this division creates a system under which development impact fees shall not be used to cure existing deficiencies in public facilities or to pay maintenance or operations costs associated with providing public facilities    1996   1996   1998   862007   1142008   842008   1152012   2 3212016 authority and applicability a

citys most recently adopted long range transportation plan the most recently adopted water facility plan the most recently adopted wastewater facility plan and the most recently adopted fire protectionems master plan b the intent of this division is to ensure that new development bears a proportionate share of the cost of improvements to the city transportation fire protection water and wastewater systems  to ensure that such proportionate share does not exceed the cost of the transportation fire protection water and wastewater facilities and equipment required to serve such new developments  and to ensure that funds collected from new developments are actually used to construct improvements to the city transportation fire protection water and wastewater systems that reasonably relate to the benefits accruing to such new developments c it is the further intent of this division that new development pay for its proportionate share of public facilities imposition of development impact fees that will be used to finance defray or reimburse all or a portion of the costs incurred by the city to construct improvements to the city transportation fire protection water and wastewater systems that serve or benefit such new development d it is not the intent of this division to collect any money from any new development in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset new demands for transportation fire protection water or wastewater improvements generated by that new development e it is not the intent of this division that any moneys collected from any development impact fee and deposited in an impact fee fund ever be comingled with moneys from a different impact fee fund or ever be used for a type of facility or equipment different from that for which the fee was paid f any funds paid pursuant to a reimbursement district established in this division do not replace or reduce any impact fees imposed upon development    1996   1998   862007

smoking in enclosed public places and places of employment footnotes  6  state law reference montana clean indoor air act mca 5040101 et seq legislative findings and intent a the city commission finds that 1 pursuant to article ii section 3 of the montana constitution all persons have certain inalienable rights that include a right to a clean and healthful environment section 1 of the montana constitution further provides the state and each person shall maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment in montana for present and future generations with respect to these rights and correlating duties it is the intent of the city commission and the citizens of the city in enacting this article to prescribe requirements concerning smoking tobacco in enclosed public places and in places of employment to provide a clean and healthful environment and to protect the health and safety of people from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke 2 numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing secondhand smoke also known as environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers including heart disease stroke respiratory disease and lung cancer the united states surgeon general has determined that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of 65000 americans annually 3 reliable scientific studies including studies by the surgeon general of the united states and studies commissioned and assessed by the us environmental protection agency have shown that breathing secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard to nonsmokers elderly people individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired respiratory function including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease children exposed to second hand smoke have an increased risk of asthma respiratory infections sudden infant death syndrome development abnormalities and cancer 4 the public health services national toxicology program has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen us dhhs 2000 citing cal epa 1997 5 the united states surgeon general has determined that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce but does not eliminate the exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke the environmental protection agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation air cleaners which are only capable of filtering the particulate matter in odors and smoke do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke 6 a significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace employees who work in smokefilled businesses suffer 25 percent to 50 percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable degrees in lung function 7 smokefilled work places result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease lower productivity higher cleaning and maintenance costs increased health insurance rates and increased liability claims for disease related to exposure to secondhand smoke 8 numerous economic analyses examining restaurant and hotel receipts and controlling for economic variables have shown either no difference or a positive economic impact after enactment of laws requiring work places to be smokefree creation of smokefree work places is sound economic policy and provides the maximum level of employee health and safety 9 smoking is a potential cause of fires  cigarette and cigar burns and ash stains on merchandise and fixtures causes economic damage to businesses 10 accordingly the city commission and the citizens of bozeman find and declare that the purposes of this article are a to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in enclosed public places and places of employment  and b to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smokefree air and to recognize that the need to breathe smokefree air shall have priority over the desire to smoke 11 the city commission finds that it is within their police

alcoholic beverages to minors the city commission hereby finds that the service of alcohol to minors at loud and unruly gatherings and the consumption of alcohol by minors at loud or unruly gatherings

households especially in the citys residential neighborhoods in addition such conduct on behalf of persons who serve alcohol to minors and minors who consume alcohol at loud or unruly gatherings

art 10   will become effective on  legislative findings the city commission hereby finds a the matter of discrimination against the citys inhabitants and visitors is a matter of concern to the residents visitors and businesses of the city b the city has a compelling governmental interest in eliminating discrimination within the city and assuring its citizens equal access to publicly available goods and services this interest includes providing its citizens a community where all persons regardless of actual or perceived race color national origin ancestry religion creed sex age martial or familial status physical or mental disability sexual orientation or gender identity or expression have a fair and equal opportunity to participate in the business and professional life of the city and may be unfettered in availing themselves of opportunities for employment housing and public accommodations c archaic and overbroad assumptions about the relative needs and capacities of individuals based on sexual orientation or gender identity or expression force those individuals to labor under stereotypical notions that often bear no relationship to their actual abilities it thereby both deprives persons of their individual dignity and denies society the benefits of wide participation in political economic and cultural life d although state and federal laws have been enacted to eliminate discrimination in employment housing and public accommodations on the basis of race creed religion color sex physical or mental disability age and national origin it is evident that lesbian gay bisexual and transgender individuals within the city have not attained equal opportunity in housing public accommodations and employment a barrier to the advancement of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender individuals in their personal and professional lives within the city is the potential discriminatory practices of employers and providers of public accommodations and housing on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity or expression while the vast majority of employers housing providers and places of public accommodations within the city certainly do not discriminate on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity or expression evidence of discriminatory practices exists within the city making it difficult for some lesbian gay bisexual or transgender individuals to find satisfactory housing obtain employment and enjoy public accommodations free from discriminatory practices e discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity or expression impacts many citizens of the city and has an especially harmful impact to young residents and visitors to the city who may be lesbian gay bisexual or trans gender because it may force them to move from the city not choose to attend university in the city may impact their participation in the democratic process and may impact their ability to fully and freely identify themselves as they seek employment housing and the services and products provided by public accommodations f discrimination in employment has and will prevent the gainful employment of citizens of the city addressed by this article and may create breaches of the peace impose added burdens upon the public for relief and welfare and cause citizens including youth to seek employment elsewhere g discrimination in housing makes it difficult for persons addressed in this article to find housing in close proximity to urban services educational facilities in price ranges that are within their earning ability and may cause citizens to seek housing outside of the city h discrimination in places of public accommodation is economically harmful to a prosperous community and is otherwise detrimental to the welfare and economic growth of the city and may cause citizens to seek public accommodations outside of the city i the recognition of religious liberty and the rights of freedom of association and expression is necessary to balance the civil rights of all residents of the city  as such provisions within this article related to fraternal charitable and religious organizations are intended to ensure a balanced approach to protecting civil rights of all citizens of the city so that the protections afforded by this article do not unreasonably impede upon a fraternal charitable or religious organizations ability to engage in activities protected by law or to disseminate its preferred views j creation of a private cause of action in the municipal court is necessary to effectuate the purpose of this article because a private cause of action will have a greater likelihood of ensuring compliance with this article than enforcement by the city due to the lack of available city resources in addition a private cause of action creates a viable mechanism for deterring discrimination throughout the city empowers an individual most affected by a violation of this article to decide for themselves whether to seek relief rather than to rely on the authority of city officials and promotes the dignity of an individual by assuring that the harmed individual receives the relief they desire for the injuries suffered   622014  policy purpose and intent a it is declared to be the policy of the city in the exercise of its police powers pursuant to its self governing authority for the protection of the public health safety and general welfare and for the maintenance of peace and good government to assure equal opportunity to all persons free from restrictions and discrimination because of his or her actual or perceived race color national origin ancestry religion creed sex age martial or familial status physical or mental disability sexual orientation or gender identity or expression b the city commission declares that in addition to the right to be free from discrimination on the basis of race color national origin ancestry religion creed sex age martial or familial status physical or mental disability the right to be free from discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity or expression is recognized as and hereby declared to be a civil right adding such discrimination prohibitions on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity or expression to the citys laws is necessary and desirable because existing state and federal laws regarding discrimination do not adequately address all discriminatory acts reported by the citys diverse residents c the provisions of this article shall be liberally construed for accomplishment of its policies and purposes  provided that however nothing in this article is intended to alter or abridge other rights protections or privileges secured by state or federal law including state and federal constitutional protections of freedom of speech freedom of association and exercise of religion or to infringe upon or alter the authority vested by law in the montana human rights commission the federal equal employment opportunity commission or any other federal or state agency

purpose conceptual review is an opportunity for an applicant to discuss requirements standards and procedures that apply to his or her development proposal major problems can be identified and solved during conceptual review before a formal application is made conceptual review applications are reviewed by the development review committee and comments are provided in writing to the applicant following the review the primary focus of conceptual review is to identify site specific challenges andor constraints critical path elements which will affect review process or submittal requirements b applicability conceptual review is required for development subject to section  and not subject to section  conceptual review may be waived by the director of community development for development proposals that would not derive substantial benefit from such review c concept plan submittal an applicant must submit the application materials required by the director of community development as provided in the conceptual review checklist d staff review and recommendation upon receipt of a concept plan and after review of such plan by the drc and a subsequent meeting with the applicant the director of community development must furnish the applicant with written comments regarding such plan including appropriate recommendations to inform and assist the applicant prior to preparing the components of the formal development application e formal application must address the comments provided with the conceptual review b informal review optional 1 purpose informal review is an opportunity for an applicant to discuss the requirements standards procedures and potential modifications of standards or variances that may be necessary for a development project while the conceptual review process is a general consideration of the development proposal informal review provides an opportunity for the applicant to have the city consider the development proposal in greater detail

their representative unless a longer period is agreed between city and applicant subsequent resubmittal requires payment of a review fee as if it were a new application b a determination that an application is adequate does not restrict the city from requesting additional information during the site plan review process 3 should the property owner choose not to provide the required information after an application has been found unacceptable nor to accept return of the application the application may be processed by the city with the recognition by the property owner that unacceptability is an adequate basis for denial of the application regardless of other merit of the application 4 the drc may grant reasonable waivers from submittal of application materials required by these regulations where it is found that these regulations allow a waiver to be requested and granted in order to be granted a waiver the applicant must include with the submission of the preliminary plan a written statement describing the requested waiver and the reasons upon which the request is based the final approval body must then consider each waiver at the time the preliminary site plan is reviewed all waivers must be identified not later than initial submittal of the preliminary site plan stage of review if in the opinion of the review authority the waived materials are necessary for proper review of the development the materials must be provided before review is completed e plans must be reviewed by the review bodies established by division  of this chapter and according to the

indicated as approximately following the centerline of streets highways or alleys must be construed to follow such centerlines  2 boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines must be construed as following such lot lines  3 boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits must be construed as following such city limits  4 boundaries indicated as following railroad lines must be construed to be midway between the main track or rails  5 boundaries indicated as following the centerline of streams rivers canals or ditches must be construed to follow such centerlines  and 6 boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated on the official zoning map must be determined by the scale of the map 7 when a parcel subject to two or more districts is subdivided and the district boundary is near a new parcel boundary the district must be construed to follow the new boundary b where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the official zoning map or where other circumstances or controversy arise over district boundaries the community development director must interpret the district boundary such interpretation is subject to appeal as set forth in division  in this chapter c where district boundaries divide a lot or parcel into two or more districts the following rule applies for the purpose of determining permitted uses and development form and intensity the community development director may allow minor adjustments up to ten percent increase or decrease in area not to exceed one acre of either zone on the applicable lot to the zoning boundary the criteria for making such a determination must include an evaluation of site topography proximity of noncompatible uses adjacent to the subject property and overall function and integration of the development with the community zoning of annexed territory a all territory which may hereafter be annexed to the city must in conjunction with the annexation be the subject of a zone map amendment in order to be designated and assigned to a city zoning district b areas of annexed public rightofway must be considered to be zoned according to the provisions of section a the city commission must determine the appropriate zoning for any and all areas to be annexed to the city but must request a recommendation from the zoning commission and must take into consideration the city growth policy any ordinance adopting such zoning amendment must not take effect prior to the effective date of such annexation zoning district intent and purpose statements residential zoning districtsintent and purpose the intent and purpose of the residential zoning districts is to establish areas within the city that are primarily residential in character and to set forth certain minimum standards for development within those areas the residential districts also allow complementary nonresidential uses the purpose in

identified in the code so that it may be determined if it is allowed within a district the community development director must determine the appropriate classification of a particular use in making this determination the community development director must find 1 that the use is the same as one or more uses permitted in the district wherein it is proposed to be located  or 2 that the use is so similar to one or more uses permitted in the district wherein it is proposed to be located as to be interpreted as the same so long as a the use and its operation are comparable with the uses permitted in the district wherein the use is proposed to be located in terms of i the amount type and pattern of vehicular traffic anticipated for the use and ii the expected outdoor uses and

development of diverse housing in accordance with the growth policy  c increase the variety of housing types available within the community  d support the creation of neighborhoods with a mix of housing opportunities for mixed incomes  and e provide opportunities for small detached cottages within existing neighborhoods b goals 1 increase housing supply and the choice of housing styles available in the community as encouraged by the growth policy  2 provide for development of housing that responds to changing demographics and smallersized households  3 support the efficient use of land and higher density infill in developed areas  4 promote housing affordability and greater choice by encouraging smaller and more diverse home sizes  5 promote highquality housing design to

departure is consistent with the intent purpose and requirements of this chapter  and do not threaten the public health safety or welfare g design standards the cottage housing option minimizes the required sizes of side rear and front setbacks on dependent lots as a result small lots are ultimately shaped by building configuration designers should consider how the arrangement of interior space affects exterior massing and how the configuration of building elements responds to adjacent buildings design strategies incorporating neighborhood context include considerations of building height transitions arrangement of buildings and open space landscape elements vehicular drive aisles and pedestrian paths and architectural details and scaling devices that break down the massing of the development with reduced setback requirements and small lot areas providing access to air light and ventilation is more challenging than with typical single dwelling designs architects and builders must use the following design standards to take full advantage of the unique design opportunities presented to them to create livable environments these design standards 1 ensure that cottage designs are based on a coherent architectural concept  2 ensure that the overall sizes of cottages are smaller and cause less visual impact than standard sized singlehousehold dwellings  3 ensure that cottages contribute positively to the architectural character of the neighborhood  4 provide flexibility in design and contrast among individual cottages while assuring attention to design features and character  and 5 provide variety in cottage housing developments mixture of building sizes and footprints the following table establishes specific performance standards for development of cottages

this section division   wireless facilities intent purpose and applicability a it is the duty of the city to protect the public health safety and welfare and the city has the authority to regulate the placement construction and modification of wireless facilities in the advancement of that duty b the city commission finds that 1 the aesthetic character of the city is a matter of substantial economic importance and general concern to the citizens of the city as described in the citys adopted growth policy and is an important part of the public welfare  2 wireless facilities are often visually obtrusive due to their necessary height support equipment and interruption of the viewscape and can have substantial negative impacts on the character of the city and its surrounding viewsheds  3 the impacts of wireless facilities can be reduced by establishing standards for location structural integrity compatibility and collocation  4 to reduce visual and other impacts on the community the city desires to promote collocation use of stealth installations of wireless facilities and the use of smaller less intrusive facilities to minimize the need to construct new large scale wireless facilities  5 the city desires to provide clear and consistent regulations for review of proposed wireless facilities  6 the city desires to support the ability of telecommunication service providers to deliver such services to the community consistent with other community objectives  7 the construction of new large scale wireless facilities is the action of last resort to provide for wireless communication services and should only be undertaken when alternatives are not available  8 it is necessary to determine the locations and circumstances most appropriate for placement of wireless facilities to serve the community  9 consistent with applicable law the city desires to minimize the adverse visual impacts of towers and antennas siting design landscape screening and innovative camouflaging screening  10 the city seeks to protect against potential health and safety hazards to citizens and prevent damage to adjacent properties  11 the city intends to exercise its authority with respect to the regulation of the placement construction and modification of wireless facilities to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law  12 the city recognizes the need to respond to the policies in the telecommunications act of 1996 and has constructed its regulations in a manner that does not unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless service and that does not prohibit or has the effect of prohibiting personal wireless service in the city  13 the city recognizes that the federal communication commission exercises certain sole authority in the licensing and other regulation of wireless services  14 the adequate review of a telecommunications application may require expertise not typically possessed by city staff which would require the city to obtain qualified outside expertise to properly evaluate an application  and 15 outside review would generate additional costs to the public to preserve the public interest these costs must be mitigated and should properly be mitigated by those causing such additional costs c general application all uses listed in this division  are subject to the specific

not sufficient to deny the application order no 201801   14 4182018 division   affordable housing findings and purpose legislative findings the city commission hereby finds a the bozeman community plan establishes a goal to encourage an adequate supply of affordable housing and land for affordable housing in bozeman a lack of affordable housing affects the ability of many residents to find housing which is adequate for their basic housing needs a lack of adequate housing affects health social stability and other issues which can have negative and intergenerational effects to fulfill this goal the community plan establishes an objective to promote the development of a variety of housing types designs and costs to meet the wide range of needs of bozeman residents b the affordable housing action plan 20122016 action plan analyzed housing needs and existing market conditions and determined housing affordability has become an acute problem as demonstrated by the number of households paying over 30 percent of their incomes for housing a 2015 update to the citys housing needs analysis action plan update concluded that the group of homebuyers with significant affordability gaps have incomes at or below 80 percent of the area medium income and are in need of subsidies andor belowmarket home prices the action plan update also determined that buying opportunities are increasingly scarce for homebuyers with incomes between 60 percent and 100 percent of ami and that housing and land prices have increased faster than incomes for many of bozemans residents c since the adoption of the bozeman community plan and the action plan the median sales price of housing has continued to climb according to the action plan update as of the end of november 201 the median home price was $28700000 d the action plan update states that the number of detached homes priced below $25000000 a rough indicator of housing affordability for a family of three at 100 percent of ami has fallen from 484 percent of the market in 2012 to just 186 percent in 2014 e there is a critical shortage of forsale housing affordable to bozeman households with incomes at and below the area median income as currently calculated by the us department of housing and urban development as a result some residents pay excessive amounts of income for housing reducing the amounts available for other necessities and a decent and adequate standard of living f limited housing opportunities within the city requires households to seek housing outside of the city limits which has a negative impact on transportation infrastructure by adding unnecessary trips to the network increased driving distance to affordable housing also negatively impacts air and water quality to maintain a sufficient resident workforce in all fields of employment and to ensure the public safety and general welfare of the residents of the city of bozeman affordable housing needs must be addressed g the city can achieve its goals of providing more affordable housing and its goal of achieving an economically balanced community only if part of the new housing built is affordable to households with low and moderate incomes h the inclusionary housing regulations codified in this ordinance will substantially advance the citys legitimate interest in assuring that additional housing is built in the city that is affordable to residents including low and moderateincome households and dispersed throughout the city in order to encourage economic integration of the citys residents i this ordinance is adopted pursuant to the citys selfgoverning powers and the citys independent general police power to protect public health safety and welfare requiring affordable housing within certain developments is consistent with the communitys housing goals of protecting the public welfare by fostering an adequate supply of housing for persons at all economic levels and maintaining both economic diversity and geographically dispersed affordable housing j requiring developers of newly created marketrate housing to provide some housing affordable to low and moderateincome households is reasonably related to the impacts of their projects because 1 rising land prices are a key factor in preventing development of new affordable housing new marketrate housing construction in bozeman has generally created strong and increasing demand for a finite stock of unbuilt land within the city and thus continues to drive up the price of remaining land new development without affordable units reduces the amount of land development opportunities available for the construction of affordable housing 2 new residents of marketrate housing place demands on services provided by both public and private sectors creating a demand for new employees some of these public and private sector employees needed to meet the needs of the new residents earn incomes only adequate to pay for affordable housing because affordable housing is in short supply in the city such employees may be forced to live in less than adequate housing within the city pay a disproportionate share of their incomes to live in adequate housing in the city or commute ever increasing distances to their jobs from housing located outside the city these circumstances harm the citys ability to attain employment and housing goals articulated in the community plan and place strains on the citys ability to accept and service new marketrate housing development purpose the purpose of this article is to promote the public health safety and welfare by ensuring that the affordable housing needs of the residents of bozeman are addressed in addition the purpose of this article is to ensure that quality housing is dispersed throughout bozemans neighborhoods for households of a variety of income levels including low and moderateincome residents to meet the goals of the community plan and the action plan by encouraging a mix of housing types throughout the city and integrating affordable housing so as to not concentrate affordable housing in a particular area in addition the ordinance is intended to alleviate the impacts that would result from the use of available residential land solely for the benefit of households that are able to afford marketrate housing and to mitigate the service burden imposed by households in new marketrate residential developments by making additional affordable housing available for service employees the ordinance is also intended to mitigate environmental and other impacts that accompany new residential development by reducing traffic transit and related air quality impacts promoting jobshousing balance and reducing the demands placed on transportation infrastructure the ordinance provides residential developers with a menu of options from which to select alternatives to the construction of inclusionary units on the same site as marketrate residential developments and provides procedural adjustments and subsidies for housing developers to ensure houses are constructed and sold in a manner that furthers the citys affordable housing goals finally the ordinance provides procedural adjustments and subsidies for housing developers who are not legally required to comply with the requirements for construction of inclusionary housing but nevertheless choose to construct affordable housing  1 1142019 applicability and definitions applicability a this article applies to 1 subdivisions and site plans which propose ten or more marketrate homes to be created new

applicable to be in compliance with this chapter including any applicable criteria of this section b land use classifications 1 the design objectives and criteria with which a planned unit development proposal must comply are dependent upon the designated growth policy land use classification and zoning district of the site proposed for the planned unit development 2 all planned unit developments are reviewed against the objectives and criteria designated for all development each individual planned unit development is then reviewed against the objectives and criteria established for the land use classification of the site on which the proposal is to be located a planned unit development must satisfy all the objectives and criteria of all applicable groups 3 in evaluating planned unit developments the city may determine that certain criteria are not applicable or are irrelevant to a particular development proposal and therefore do not apply to that proposal unless those criteria are applicable to a deviation which is being sought by the applicant of this section contains the groups of objectives and criteria against which planned unit developments are reviewed c evaluation process the acceptability and performance of a planned unit development proposal will be evaluated as follows each of the relevant objectives and criteria for the applicable land use classification and for all development contained in subsection e of this section will be answered yes no or not applicable na a no response to any of the applicable objectives and criteria will automatically preclude the development proposal from further consideration and eventual approval unless a deviation is granted by the review authority an objective or criterion is applicable if it can reasonably be applied to the development proposal the applicant must clearly demonstrate how the planned unit development specifically addresses each applicable objective and criterion d responsibility for impact mitigation to protect the character of new and existing neighborhoods against intrusive and disruptive development any negative or adverse impacts must be effectively mitigated in the planned unit development plan per the following guidelines 1 when two adjacent parcels are developed simultaneously the responsibility for mitigating conflicts is upon the more intense use 2 when a use is the first to develop on two adjacent vacant parcels the first use must provide the necessary buffer to any reasonable future use as determined by the city 3 the second use to develop must at the time it develops take all additional steps necessary to mitigate conflicts 4 when a planned unit development includes a use or uses which are not otherwise permitted in the underlying zoning district the responsibility for impact mitigation lies exclusively with the planned unit development proposal e design objectives and pud review criteria 1 the city will determine compatibility of a project based upon the evidence presented during evaluation of the community design objectives and criteria of this chapter 2 in addition to the criteria for all site plan and conditional use reviews the following criteria will be used in evaluating all planned unit development applications a all development all land uses within a proposed planned unit development must comply with the applicable objectives and

division   introduction purpose this article implements the bozemans growth policy overall this article a provides clear objectives for those embarking on the planning and design of development projects in bozeman  b preserves and protects the public health safety and welfare of the citizens of bozeman  c ensures that new commercial and multihousehold development is of high quality and beneficially contributes to bozemans character  d ensures that new developments within existing neighborhoods are compatible with and enhance the character of bozemans neighborhoods  e promotes an increase in walking and bicycling throughout the city  f enhances the livability of bozemans residential developments  g maintains and enhances property values within bozeman applicability and compliance the provisions in this article apply to development however since each division within it addresses different design and development elements the applicability of each division is clarified at the beginning of the division for instance some divisions may only apply to new commercial and multihousehold development while individual sections in division  only apply to specific housing types a relationship to other codes and documents where provisions of this article conflict with provisions in any other section of the udc this article prevails unless otherwise noted relationship with other notable design provisions and guidelines 1 for sites within the citys established neighborhood conservation overlay district the provisions of division  supersede the provisions of this article however the review authority may apply the provisions of this article in the event of a conflict where the review authority determines that the provisions herein help new development better meet the purpose and intent of neighborhood conservation overlay district per section  2 the director of community development will maintain a design manual to illustrate best practices to implement the design standards of this chapter the design manual is to assist citizens and design professionals by providing visuals and illustrative examples of the intent of the citys guidelines and regulations b for building additions and remodels three different thresholds have been established to gauge how the project design standards in this article are applied to such projects see figure  below for examples of site development and the respective types of improvements required under each of the three levels of improvements 1 level i improvements include all exterior remodels building additions andor site improvements commenced within a threeyear period based on the date of permit issuance that affect the exterior appearance of the buildingsite andor increase the buildings area by up to 20 percent the requirement for such improvements is that the proposed improvements meet the standards and do not lead to further nonconformance with the standards for example if a property owner decides to replace a building faades siding then the siding must meet the applicable exterior building material standards but elements such as building articulation see section  would not be required 2 level ii improvements include all improvements commenced within a threeyear period based on the date of permit issuance that increase the buildings area by more than 20 percent but not greater than 50 percent all standards that do not involve repositioning the building or reconfiguring site development apply to level ii improvements for example if a property owner of an existing home in the b2 zoning district wants to convert the home to an office and build an addition equaling 45 percent of the current buildings area then the following requirements apply a the location and design of the additionremodel must be consistent with the block frontage standards division  which address building frontages entries parking lot location and front setback landscaping for such developments seeking additions to buildings where offstreet parking location currently does not comply with applicable parking location standards building additions are allowed provided they do not increase any current nonconformity and generally bring the project closer into conformance with the standards see division  parking b compliance with applicable site planning and design elements division  c compliance with all building design provisions of division  except architectural scale and materials provisions related to the existing portion of the building where no exterior changes are proposed the entire building must comply with building elementsdetails materials and blank wall treatment standards of section  d compliance with the offstreet parking landscaping signage and lighting provisions of divisions 580 that relate to proposed improvements 3 level iii improvements include all improvements commenced within a threeyear period based on the date of permit issuance that increase the buildings area by more than 50 percent such developments must conform to all applicable standards site improvements are addressed in sections  and  figure  examples of site development and the respective types of improvements required under each of the three levels of improvements division   block frontage standards introduction a purpose 1 to provide standards to implement the growth policy and applicable adopted subarea plans  2 to design sites and orient buildings with an emphasis on compatible development and creating a comfortable walking environment  and 3 to provide standards that recognize the need for a system of streets and block frontages b applicability the provisions of this division apply to all development within bozeman except single to fourhousehold dwellings in any configuration also 1 for clarification on the relationship between the provisions in this division and other documents and codes see section a 2 for the application of building additions remodels and site improvements see section b c how to use this division block frontage standards for individual properties depend on the zoning designation adjacent that the properties front onto and community design framework map take the following steps in using this division 1 determine the zoning of your property then see section  to find the block frontage type designation for the street or streets fronting your property for properties in residential zones the standards for landscaped block frontages see section c apply for properties in industrial zones see section h for properties that front onto multiple streets see provisions in section f  and 2 go to the appropriate code section in this division for the standards applicable to the block frontage type designation table a includes a summary of the five primary street frontage type designations along with links to the appropriate sections the intention for each block frontage designation and key designuse provisions  3 632019 community design framework maps and standards a about the maps the maps together with the block frontage standards in section  guide the look and feel of development in commercial and multihousehold areas throughout bozeman when viewed from the street the provisions herein recognize that there is a hierarchy of different streets and block frontage types ranging from pedestrianoriented storefronts to arterial streetsfrontages that warrant greater flexibility in the design of frontages the block frontage standards address streetfront elements including 1 building location and orientation 2 parking lot location 3 window transparency 4 weather protection 5 landscaping the community design framework maps also identify high visibility street corner sites that warrant special design treatment ultimately these formbased provisions will help to reinforce existing and desired development patterns intended to implement the growth policy including adopted neighborhood plans b all block frontages within residential zones are subject to landscaped block frontage provisions set forth in section c c all block frontages within industrial zones are subject to the provisions of section h d the default block frontage for new or undesignated streets such as those within annexed land in commercial and mixeduse zones is mixed see the mixed block frontage

intent of the standards division   parking general provisions a parking is one part of the overall multimodal transportation system individual choice of travel mode and development characteristics influence the need for parking the purpose of this division  in requiring parking spaces is to ensure provision of offstreet motor vehicle parking bicycle parking and other transportation access facilities in rough proportion to the generalized parking and transportation demands of different land uses which locate at a site some sites such as those that are located in close proximity to transit have good access to pedestrian facilities or have offset peak uses may require less onsite parking the purpose of these standards is to provide functional parking areas adequate to the needs of users create shaded areas within parking lots reduce glare and heat buildup reduce stormwater surges provide visual relief within paved parking areas emphasize circulation patterns avoid the negative impacts associated with spillover parking into adjacent neighborhoods while at the same time avoiding the negative environmental and urban design impacts that can result from excessive parking lots and other vehicular use areas and enhance the visual environment the provisions of this division are also intended to help protect the public health safety and general welfare by helping avoid and mitigate traffic congestion  encouraging multimodal transportation options and enhanced pedestrian safety  providing methods to reduce the amount of impervious surfaces in parking areas and adequate drainage structures in order to reduce the environmental impacts of stormwater runoff  encouraging paving or alternate means of surfacing of parking areas in order to address dust abatement and improve air quality  and providing flexible methods of responding to the transportation and access demands of various land uses in different areas of the city in achieving these purposes this division interacts with the requirements of division  of this chapter the design of offstreet parking is the responsibility of the developer and must consider traffic circulation intended landscaping

development of floodprone lands and conditions and safeguards established are subject to the provisions of division  of this chapter division   wetland regulations title and applicability these regulations are known as the city wetland regulations and may be cited as the wetlands regulations these wetland regulations govern areas in compliance with the 1987 us army corps of engineers wetland delineation manual of the us 1987 corps manual or the most current wetland delineation manual sanctioned by the army corps of engineers acoeomaha district this manual provides specific guidelines and methods to identify whether an area is a wetland and to determine the boundary between wetlands and uplands the citys wetland regulations will pertain to wetlands with a direct hydrologic connection to waters of the us those wetlands that connect to a federallyregulated stream or river directly or via a series or watercourse wetlands or ditches and also to isolated wetlands with no direct connection to a water of the us and exhibit positive wetland indicators for all three wetland parameters the provisions contained in these regulations do not apply to wetlands created by a wholly manmade water source used for irrigation purposes or stormwater control intent and purpose a wetlands perform many important ecological functions it is the intent and purpose of this division  to protect preserve and enhance wetlands to provide 1 aquifer recharge  2 water storage  3 regional stream hydrology discharge and recharge  4 flood control and storage  5 sediment control filter for waste  6 nutrient removal from urban runoff  and 7 erosion control b wetlands provide important values that enhance the quality of life of community residents it is the intent of this division  to protect preserve and enhance wetlands to provide 1 habitat for fish wildlife and plants including endangered and threatened  2 recreation  3 open space  4 visual and aesthetic  5 education and research  and 6 historical cultural and archaeological resources c wetlands can present significant constraints to development wetlands typically form in areas characterized by poor drainage conditions which are illsuited for most types of development development in these areas often involves extra expense resulting from considerations for site drainage flood protection and facility maintenance in addition wetlands are characterized by hydric soils that are unstable for most types of development hydric soils tend to compress under the weight of structures and decompose when drained therefore costs of development may be greater due to complex engineering design requirements or the need to excavate and replace the soils it is the intent of these regulations to protect public and private facilities and structures from damage and to minimize public and private development and maintenance costs d it is not the intent of this division  to prohibit all activities within regulated areas and associated buffers but rather to encourage the avoidance of regulated activities within the regulated areas and to require best management practices in regulated areas e nothing in this division  will be construed to prevent irrigation companies from diverting and carrying water under historic water rights or owners of such rights from exercising those historic rights f nothing in this division  will be construed to prevent compliance with applicable state or federal statutes and regulations application of wetland regulations a these regulations apply to any regulated activity which may impact wetlands as defined in section  known prior to or discovered development review process and verified sitespecific wetlands boundary determination when any regulated activity is proposed a wetlands boundary determination must be conducted if the determination finds that there are no wetlands present on the subject tract these regulations do not apply if however wetlands
