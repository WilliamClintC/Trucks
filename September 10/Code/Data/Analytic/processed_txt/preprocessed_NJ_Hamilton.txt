that such flooding damage endangers life and public and private property and facilities  that this condition is aggravated by development and encroachments in the floodplain  and that the most appropriate method of alleviating such conditions is of such developments and encroachments it is therefore any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local

blank facades facing the street line will not be permitted b the governing body hereby finds that uniformity in the exterior design and appearance of dwellings erected in the same residential neighborhood tends to adversely affect the desirability of the immediate and neighboring areas for residential purposes and impairs existing residential property in such areas  tends to impair the value of both improved and unimproved real property in such areas  and tends to deprive the municipality of tax revenue and destroys a proper balance between the taxable value of real property in such areas and the cost of municipal services provided therefor it is the purpose of this section to prevent these and other harmful effects of uniformity in design and appearance of dwellings erected in any housing development in the same residential neighborhood and thus to promote and protect the general welfare of the community 1 not more than one construction permit shall be issued for any particular singlefamily detached dwelling unit design in any housing development consisting of two or more detached dwellings when the houses are substantially alike in exterior design and appearance

whichever distance will provide the least separation between houses 2 houses within such specified distance from each other shall be considered uniform in exterior design and appearance if they have any one of the following characteristics a the same basic dimensions and floor plans are used without substantial differentiation of one or more exterior elevations b the height and design of the roofs are without substantial change in design and appearance c the size and type of windows and doors in the front elevation are without substantial differentiation  550112 hamilton code  550112
