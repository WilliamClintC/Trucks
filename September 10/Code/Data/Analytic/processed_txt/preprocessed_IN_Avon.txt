the entire zoning ordinance town of avon indiana 2 town chapter 17 floodplain regulations _____________________________________________________________________________ findings of fact statement of purpose objectives general provisions administration provisions for flood hazard reduction variance procedures _____________________________________________________________________________ findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the town of avon are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and 6 make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the town of avon by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program objectives the objectives of this chapter are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  avon zoning ordinance town of avon indiana 3 town  to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas and  7 to ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area general provisions 1 lands to which this this chapter shall apply to all sfhas within the jurisdiction of the town of avon 2 basis for establishing regulatory flood data this chapters protection standard is the regulatory flood the best available regulatory flood data is listed below
