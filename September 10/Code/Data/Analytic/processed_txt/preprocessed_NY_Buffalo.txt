contracts to private firms to provide services to the public and to city government experience indicates that procurement by contract of services has all too often resulted in the payment by service contractors to their employees of wages at or slightly above the minimum required by federal and state minimum wage laws such minimal compensation tends to inhibit the quantity and quality of services rendered by such employees to the city and to the public underpaying employees in this way fosters high turnover absenteeism and lackluster performance conversely adequate compensation promotes amelioration of these undesirable conditions through this section the city intends to require service contractors to provide a minimum level of compensation that will improve the level of services rendered to and for the city 2 the inadequate compensation typically paid today also fails to provide service employees with resources sufficient to afford life in the city of buffalo it is unacceptable that contracting decisions involving the expenditure of city funds could foster conditions placing a burden on limited social services 3 the city of buffalo has a limited amount of taxpayer resources to expend  and even in promising economic times far too many working buffalo residents and their families live below or near the poverty line 4 due to strict new time limits on public assistance access to familysupporting jobs in buffalo is especially crucial and as a result of new work requirements imposed by welfare reform the influx of former welfare recipients into lowwage labor market is projected to lower these workers wages 5 the use of taxpayer dollars to promote sustenance and create familysupporting jobs will increase consumer income while decreasing levels of poverty in the city of buffalo new homeowners contribute additional property tax revenue while spending more money in our city economy at neighborhood businesses additionally desperate neighborhoods overly dependent on lowwage jobs are blessed with a decrease in crime given the compelling relationship between crime statistics and lowwage work and for buffalo students facing tougher educational standards ending the poverty cycle is imperative  presently many of buffalos school children are so poor that they qualify for free school lunches andor breakfasts no child can learn while hungry and hunger is the first result of debilitating poverty  9619 buffalo code  9619 c696 6 in addition on a regionwide basis livingwage legislation may benefit the larger community by reducing reliance on taxpayerfunded public assistance such as food stamps medicaid emergency medical services and other social programs provided by the erie county government 7 community organizations

of legislative findings and intent a the common council of the city of buffalo hereby finds that certain alcohol product manufacturers have admitted engaging in strategies designed to advertise and promote products to minors and that such strategies undermine state law prohibiting the sale or distribution of alcohol products to minors the council further finds that exposure of minors to such alcohol product advertising and promotion may be constitutionally restricted enactment of reasonable targeted limitations on the advertising and promotion of such products near schools and other like locations regularly frequented by children so as to strengthen compliance with and enforcement of laws prohibiting the sale or distribution of alcohol products to children and protect children against such illegal sales b the council is cognizant of the necessity of acting within the protections afforded by the first amendment to the united states constitution and has therefore narrowly tailored the scope and effect of this legislation to impose reasonable time place and manner restrictions on alcohol advertising aimed at or regularly seen by youth while not directly affecting advertising at adults c it is well settled law that the first amendment protects commercial speech but to a lesser degree than the protection afforded other fully protected speech in analyzing the constitutionality of commercial speech regulation the united states supreme court prescribed a fourprong test in central hudson gas & electric corporation v public service commission of new york 447 us 557 1980 the central hudson test includes the following four prongs 1 whether the commercial speech at issue concerns a lawful activity and is not misleading  2 whether the asserted governmental interest in restricting the commercial speech is substantial   4491 buffalo code  4521 c1760  4522 short title this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the youth protection against alcohol advertising and

that confectionery containing alcohol as provided by the new york state agriculture and markets law  20012 shall not be regarded as an alcoholic beverage within the meaning of this section 3 the restriction must directly advance the governmental interest asserted  and 4 that the restrictions are not more extensive than are necessary to serve that governmental interest d the restrictions on commercial speech contained in this council legislation are permissible under the central hudson fourprong test the commercial speech at issue concerns a lawful activity and is not misleading at least as it applies to consenting adults the governmental interest in restricting the commercial speech at issue is one grounded in the preexisting prohibition on the sale and distribution of alcohol products to minors and directly related to countering the adverse impact of an industry strategy admittedly directed at younger prospective drinkers by restricting modes of advertisement and locations for advertisements that are more likely to be addressed to and seen by minors this council legislation directly advances the governmental interest in enforcing the ban on the sale and distribution of alcohol products to minors finally as the restrictions in this council legislation focus on modes and locations of communication that are more likely than not to have a direct impact upon minors namely sites within 1000 feet of a school child daycare center childrens institution youth center playground or amusement arcade the restrictions contained in this council legislation are not more extensive than are necessary to serve the governmental interests asserted herein other forms of advertising including newspapers magazines audio and video media that are less likely to have a direct

mature tree particularly in light of the fact that the survival rate for saplings is diminished in an urban environment g the convenience of clearing all trees from a piece of land and planting trees
