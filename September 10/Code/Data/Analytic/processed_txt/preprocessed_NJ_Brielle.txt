bh231 preamble  whereas the mayor and council of the borough of brielle is aware of the problems in the borough caused by a large feral cat population  and whereas there are no facilities in the borough of brielle or the county of monmouth to address issues created by feral cats  and whereas the population of feral cats has been increasing in the borough  and whereas communities throughout the united states have determined that the practice of trapping and euthanizing feral cats is not effective in reducing their numbers  and whereas a present goal of trapneuterreturn tnr is to decrease the number of cats in the environment and thereby reduce feral cat predation on wildlife  and whereas programs for the managed care of feral cat colonies that include trapping neutering and returning such cats to their habitats have proven to be effective in reducing the number of feral cats and is more humane than trapping and euthanizing  whereas tnr programs are beneficial to communities and the public health because cats in managed colonies are vaccinated against rabies which has positive public consequences and are spayed or neutered thereby controlling the population  and whereas the mayor and council deems it in the public interest to amend its ordinances in order to meet these stated goals  bh232 study and review  not later than  the borough of brielle shall study the
