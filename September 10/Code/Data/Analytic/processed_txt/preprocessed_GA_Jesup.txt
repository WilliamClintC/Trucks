selfevident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality which do not vary greatly among generally comparable counties in our county b moreover it is the finding of the board of commissioners that either partial or total public nudity under certain circumstances particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in socalled nude bars or establishments offering socalled nude entertainment or adult entertainment leads to an increase of criminal behavior in the surrounding area and creates undesirable community conditions blight and diminution in property values in the same manner establishments offering photographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community c among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol live commercial nudity in general and photographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct prostitution solicitation drug trafficking drug use and corruption of public officials among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol commercial nudity in general and photographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement

commissioners that other forms of adult entertainment including but not limited to adult bookstores peep shows adult theaters and massage parlors have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in
