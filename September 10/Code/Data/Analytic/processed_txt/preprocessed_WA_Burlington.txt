abutting land uses collector arterial service is required for the majority of land uses which generate measurably important traffic volumes such as plats churches small parks and recreation areas convenience shopping centers and other areas which are not served by major or secondary arterials collector arterials need not be particularly long or continuous since this would tend to attract

applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a ds is likely under wac 19711350 the request must 1follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the city is lead agency  and 2precede the citys actual threshold determination for the proposal cthe responsible official should respond to the request for early notice within 15 working days the response shall 1be written  2state whether the city currently considers issuance of a ds likely and if so indicate the general or specific areas of concern that are leading the city to consider a ds  and 3state that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts revising the environmental checklist andor permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications das much as possible the city should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures ewhen the applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal along with a revised or amended environmental checklist the city shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within 15 days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal 1if the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures the city shall issue and circulate a dns under wac 197113402 2if the city indicated areas of concern but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a dns the city shall make the threshold determination issuing a dns or ds as appropriate 3the applicants proposed mitigation measures clarifications changes or conditions must be in writing and must be specific for example proposals to control noise or prevent storm water runoff are inadequate whereas proposals to muffle machinery to x decibel or construct 200foot storm water retention pond at y location are adequate 4mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated dns may be incorporated in the dns by reference to agency staff reports studies or other documents fa mitigated dns is issued either under wac 197113402 requiring a 14day comment period and public notice or under wac 19711335 which may require no additional comment period beyond the comment period on the notice of application gmitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated dns shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city failure to comply with the designated mitigation measures shall be grounds for suspension andor revocation of any issued license or permit hif the citys tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated dns for the proposal the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with wac 197113403a withdrawal of dns ithe citys written response under subsection b of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance in addition preliminary discussions of clarifications or changes to a proposal as opposed to a written request

and environmental functions and help to protect public health safety and welfare by providing flood storage and conveyance erosion control fish and shellfish production fish and wildlife habitat recreation water quality protection water storage education scientific research and other public benefits it is the purpose of this chapter to protect these functions to prevent the continual loss of wetlands and where practical to enhance or restore wetland functions and values  2fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas in addition to their intrinsic value certain species of fish and wildlife represent important historic cultural recreational and economic resources many species serve as indicators of the condition of the environment and the quality of life that local residents have invested in enjoy and respect it is the purpose of this chapter to protect restore where practical and enhance fish and wildlife populations and their associated habitats  3frequently flooded areas it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in the floodplain and the floodway according to the provisions established under this code  and 4geologically hazardous areas geologically hazardous areas include areas susceptible to the effects of erosion sliding earthquake or other geologic events they pose a threat to the health and safety of citizens when incompatible residential commercial industrial or infrastructure development is sited in areas of a hazard geologic hazards pose a risk to life property and resources when steep slopes are destabilized by inappropriate activities and development or when structures or facilities are sited in areas susceptible to natural or human caused geologic events some geologic hazards can be reduced or mitigated by engineering design or modified construction practices so that risks to health and safety are acceptable when technology cannot reduce risks to acceptable levels building and other construction within identified geologically hazardous areas shall be prohibited exh b 2018  purpose athis chapter is adopted to assist in orderly development conserve the value of property safeguard the public welfare and provide protection for defined critical areas bit is the purpose of this chapter to prevent contamination and depletion avoid exorbitant cleanup costs hardships and potential physical harm to people cthe ordinance codified in this chapter was developed under the directives of the growth management act to conserve and protect critical areas pursuant to rcw 3670a172 critical areas are defined as wetlands aquifer recharge areas flood hazard areas geologically hazardous areas and fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas some of these areas such as geologic hazards and flood hazard areas are critical because of the hazard they represent to public health others such as fish and wildlife habitats and wetlands are critical because of their public value dmaps are useful primarily as an indicator of the distribution and extent of critical areas maps will be used wherever possible as part of the screening process for evaluating individual permit applications although a number of map resources are utilized in this chapter regulatory measures such as buffer requirements are based upon the identification of critical areas during the permit development authorization or other approval processes ecritical areas will be designated by definition and then classified assessments so that they can be identified using scientifically based criteria and protected the use of site assessments to confirm the actual presence and classification of critical areas is central to the management approach developed under this chapter fthe ordinance codified in this chapter was drafted to provide regulatory structure for identification designation and protection of critical areas this chapter allows staff to provide site visits preliminary reviews and preapplication meetings to assist in the identification of critical areas gthese regulations are intended to 1protect human life property and the public health and safety of the citizens of burlington  2minimize the expenditure of public money  3maintain the citys flood insurance eligibility while avoiding regulations which are unnecessarily restrictive or difficult to administer  4ensure that wetland and other critical area functions and values are protected to provide public benefits exh b 2018  authority the ordinance

with a lesser impact on the critical area than the use proposed  and bthe proposed development does not pose a threat to the public health and safety  and any proposed modification to a critical area will be evaluated of a site assessment and mitigation plan prepared by the applicants qualified consultant pursuant to the requirements of this chapter and will be the minimum necessary to allow reasonable and economically viable use of the property  and creasonable use determinations may be issued with conditions of approval including modifications to the size and placement of structures and facilities to minimize impacts to critical areas and associated buffers mitigation requirements may also be imposed to ensure that all impacts are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible exh b 2018  critical area and buffer mitigation requirements  general provisions abuffers 1as described in more detail in each relevant section buffers have in some cases been determined necessary and appropriate to protect critical areas and their functions or to prevent risk from a critical area hazard in those sections of this chapter where specific buffers are identified those buffers are deemed required or standard buffers if a project or activity does not propose any alteration of those buffers or of the associated critical area and the city determines that these buffers are adequate to protect the critical area or to prevent risk of a hazard from the critical area then subject to the provisions of this section no additional mitigation will be required once the critical area and its buffer have properly been delineated critical areas assessment and any conditions of approval have been established to ensure protection of the critical area function no further critical areas mitigation assessment is required except as necessary to ensure that longterm protection of critical areas and buffers is met in practice with the provisions of this section the applicant shall ensure the protection of critical area by performing a site assessment on the entire parcel 2if however based on a site assessment by a qualified expert unique features of the particular critical area or its buffer or of the proposed development the qualified expert determines that additional buffers andor mitigation measures beyond these buffers are necessary to adequately protect the function of the critical area or to prevent risk of a hazard from the critical area such additional mitigation requirements may be imposed provided the qualified expert can demonstrate based on best available science why that additional mitigation or buffering is required to adequately protect the critical area function or to prevent hazard from a critical area 3if the applicant proposes to reduce buffers or to alter the critical area or its required buffer then the applicant shall demonstrate based on best available science why such buffer andor critical area modification together with such alternative mitigation proposed in the critical areas assessment is sufficient to provide equal or better protection of the critical area function or provide no increased risk of a hazard from the critical area 4the critical areas assessment and the conditions of approval shall make adequate provision for longterm protection related to critical areas and buffers and shall fully address the requirements of this chapter however critical areas andor buffers identified as protected critical areas pcas as defined in this chapter do not require any provisions for public access and appropriate restrictions may be included in the easement or title documents critical areas andor buffers identified as pcas are however subject to periodic inspection by the director upon prior notification to the landowner

that triggers a development permit and has not had its critical areas and associated buffers delineated because it was outside the project or area affected by the project then further critical areas assessment may be required in the future prior to any change of use or new development permit for that portion of the site bmitigation all proposed alterations to critical areas or associated buffers shall require mitigation sufficient to provide for and maintain the functional values of the critical area or to prevent risk from a critical area hazard and shall give adequate consideration to the reasonable economically viable use of the property mitigation of one critical area impact should not result in unmitigated impacts to another critical area mitigation may include but is not limited to buffers setbacks limits on clearing and grading best management practices for erosion control and maintenance of water quality or other conditions appropriate to avoid or mitigate identified adverse impacts cpreferred mitigation sequence mitigation includes avoiding minimizing or compensating for adverse impacts to regulated critical areas or their buffers the preferred sequence of mitigation is defined below 1avoid the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action  2minimize the impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation by using appropriate technology or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts  3rectify the impact by repairing rehabilitating or restoring the affected environment to the conditions existing at the time of the initiation of the project or activity  4reduce or eliminate the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action  5compensate for the impact by replacing enhancing or providing substitute resources or environments  6all proposed mitigation shall be included in the critical areas assessment the critical areas mitigation shall include the

the washington department of ecology wetland rating system as set forth in the washington state wetland rating system for western washington 2014 update ecology publication no 1406029 effective january 2015 or as revised and approved by ecology which contains the definitions and methods for determining whether the criteria below are met 1category i category i wetlands are a relatively undisturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre  b wetlands of high conservation value that are identified by scientists of the washington natural heritage programdnr  c bogs  d mature and oldgrowth forested wetlands larger than one acre  e wetlands in coastal lagoons  f interdunal wetlands that score eight or nine habitat points and are larger than one acre  and g wetlands that perform many functions well scoring 23 points or more these wetlands a represent unique or rare wetland types  b are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands  c are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime  or d provide a high level of functions 2category ii category ii wetlands are a estuarine wetlands smaller than one acre or disturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre  b interdunal wetlands larger than one acre or those found in a mosaic of wetlands  or c wetlands with a moderately high level of functions scoring between 20 and 22 points 3category iii category iii wetlands are a wetlands with a moderate level of functions scoring between 16 and 19 points  b can often be adequately replaced with a wellplanned mitigation project  and c interdunal wetlands between 01 and one acre wetlands scoring between 16 and 19 points generally have been disturbed in some ways and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than category ii wetlands 4category iv category iv wetlands have the lowest levels of functions scoring fewer than 16 points and are often heavily disturbed these are wetlands that we should be able to replace or in some cases to improve however experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case these wetlands may provide some important functions and should be protected to some degree exh b 2018  wetland buffers astandard wetland buffer widths the standard buffer widths in table 1 have been established in accordance with the best available science they are based on the category of wetland and the habitat score as determined by a qualified wetland professional using the washington state wetland rating system for western washington 1buffer conditions athese buffer widths assume that the buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the ecoregion if the existing buffer is

replacement of wetland type or functions will best meet watershed goals formally identified by the city such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types dpreference of mitigation actions mitigation for lost or diminished wetland and buffer functions shall rely on the types below in the following order of preference 1restoration reestablishment and rehabilitation of wetlands athe goal of reestablishment is returning natural or historic functions to a former wetland reestablishment results in a gain in wetland acres and functions activities could include removing fill material plugging ditches or breaking drain tiles bthe goal of rehabilitation is repairing natural or historic functions of a degraded wetland rehabilitation results in a gain in wetland function but does not result in a gain in wetland acres 2creation establishment of wetlands on disturbed upland sites such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of nonnative species establishment results in a gain in wetland acres this should be attempted only when there is an adequate source of water and it can be shown that the surface and subsurface hydrologic regime is conducive to the wetland community that is anticipated in the design aif a site is not available for wetland restoration to compensate for expected wetland andor buffer impacts the approval authority may authorize creation of a wetland and buffer upon demonstration by the applicants qualified wetland scientist that ithe hydrology and soil conditions at the proposed mitigation site are conducive for sustaining the proposed wetland and that creation of a wetland at the site will not likely cause hydrologic problems elsewhere  iithe proposed mitigation site does not contain invasive plants or noxious weeds or that such vegetation will be completely eradicated at the site  iiiadjacent land uses and site conditions do not jeopardize the viability of the proposed wetland and buffer eg due to the presence of invasive plants or noxious weeds storm water runoff noise light or other impacts  and ivthe proposed wetland and buffer will eventually be selfsustaining with little or no longterm maintenance 3enhancement of significantly degraded wetlands in combination with restoration or creation enhancement should be part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the altered area and meeting appropriate ratio requirements enhancement is undertaken for specified purposes such as water quality improvement flood water retention or wildlife habitat applicants proposing to enhance wetlands or associated buffers shall demonstrate ahow the proposed enhancement will increase the wetlandsbuffers functions  bhow this increase in function will adequately compensate for the impacts  and chow all other existing wetland functions at the mitigation site will be protected 4preservation preservation of highquality atrisk wetlands as compensation are generally acceptable when done in combination with restoration creation or enhancement  provided that a minimum of  acreage replacement is provided ratios for preservation in combination with other forms of mitigation generally range from  to  as determined on a casebycase basis depending on the quality of the wetlands being altered and the quality of the wetlands being preserved preservation of highquality atrisk wetlands and habitat may be considered as the sole means of compensation for wetland impacts when the following criteria are met athe area proposed for preservation is of high quality the following features may be indicative of highquality sites

priority or locally important wildlife species ivpriority sites in an adopted watershed plan bwetland impacts will not have a significant adverse impact on habitat for listed fish or other esa listed species cthere is no net loss of habitat functions within the watershed or basin dmitigation ratios for preservation as the sole means of mitigation shall generally start at  specific ratios should depend upon the significance of the preservation project and the quality of the wetland resources lost epermanent preservation of the wetland and buffer will be provided conservation easement or tract held by a land trust or land in public ownership fthe impact area is small generally less than onehalf acre andor impacts are occurring to a lowfunctioning system category iii or iv wetland all preservation sites shall include buffer areas adequate to protect the habitat and its functions from encroachment and degradation elocation of compensatory mitigation compensatory mitigation actions shall be conducted within the same subdrainage basin and on the site of the alteration except when all of subsections e1 4 of this section apply in that case mitigation may be allowed off site within the subwatershed of the impact site when considering offsite mitigation preference should be given to using alternative mitigation such as a mitigation bank an inlieu fee program or advanced mitigation 1there are no reasonable opportunities on site or within the subdrainage basin eg onsite options would require elimination of highfunctioning upland habitat or opportunities on site or within the subdrainage basin do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts considerations should include anticipated replacement ratios for wetland mitigation buffer conditions and proposed widths available water to maintain anticipated hydrogeomorphic classes of wetlands when restored proposed flood storage capacity and potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife impacts such as connectivity 2onsite mitigation would require elimination of highquality upland habitat 3offsite mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the altered wetland 4offsite locations shall be in the same subdrainage basin unless aestablished watershed goals for water quality flood storage or conveyance habitat or other wetland functions have been established by the city and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site  or bcredits from a statecertified wetland mitigation bank are used as compensation and the use of credits is consistent with the terms of the certified bank instrument  or cfees are paid to an approved inlieu fee program to compensate for the impacts the design for the compensatory mitigation project needs to be appropriate for its location ie position in the landscape therefore compensatory mitigation should not result in the creation restoration or enhancement of an atypical wetland an atypical wetland refers to a compensation wetland eg created or enhanced that does not match the type of existing wetland that would be found in the geomorphic setting of the site ie the water sources and hydroperiod proposed for the mitigation site are not typical for the geomorphic setting likewise it should not provide exaggerated morphology or require a berm or other engineered structures to hold back water for example excavating a permanently inundated pond in an existing seasonally saturated or inundated wetland is one example of an enhancement project that could result in an atypical wetland another example would be excavating depressions in an existing wetland on a slope which would require the construction of berms to hold the water ftiming of compensatory mitigation it is preferred that compensatory mitigation projects be completed prior to activities that will disturb wetlands at the least compensatory mitigation shall be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the action or development construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries wildlife and flora 1the community development director may authorize a onetime temporary delay in completing construction or installation of the compensatory mitigation when the applicant provides a written explanation from a qualified wetland professional as to the rationale for the delay an appropriate rationale would include identification of the environmental conditions that could produce a high probability of failure or significant construction difficulties eg project delay lapses past a fisheries window or installing plants should be delayed until the dormant season to ensure greater survival of installed materials the delay shall not create or perpetuate hazardous conditions or environmental damage or degradation and the delay shall not be injurious to the health safety or general welfare of the public the request for the temporary delay must include a written justification that documents the environmental constraints that include implementation of

landward 200 feet from the floodway and the gages slough wetlands should means that the particular action is required unless there is a demonstrated compelling reason based on policy of the shoreline management act and this title against taking the action significant ecological impact means an effect or consequence of a human caused action if any of the following apply 1the action degrades or changes an ecological function or ecosystemwide process to such a degree that the ecosystem can no longer perform the function at levels within its natural range of variability or that the performance of the function falls outside the range needed to maintain the integrity of other ecological processes in shoreline areas as used in this definition the normal range of variability does not include alterations caused by catastrophic events 2scientific evidence or objective analysis indicates that the action could cause degradation or change to those ecological functions or ecosystemwide processes described in subsection 1 of this definition under foreseeable conditions 3scientific evidence indicates that the action could contribute to degradation or change to ecological functions or ecosystemwide processes described in subsection 1 of this definition as part of cumulative impacts due to similar actions that are occurring or are likely to occur significant ecological impacts do not include impacts that are inconsequential to attaining the objectives of the act or to the protection and restoration of shoreline ecological functions or ecosystemwide processes significant vegetation removal means the removal of trees shrubs andor ground cover by clearing grading cutting burning chemical means or other activity that causes significant ecological impacts to functions provided by such vegetation the removal of invasive or noxious weeds does not constitute significant vegetation removal tree pruning not including tree topping where it does not affect ecological functions does not constitute significant vegetation removal stream means a naturally occurring body of periodic or continuously flowing water where 1the mean annual flow is greater than 20 cubic feet per second  and 2the water is contained within a channel a channel is an open conduit either naturally or artificially created this definition does not include artificially created irrigation return flow or stockwatering channels structure means a permanent or temporary edifice or building or any piece of work artificially built or composed of parts joined together in some definite manner whether installed on above or below the surface of the ground or water except for vessels substantial development shall mean any development of which the total cost or fair market value exceeds $5781 effective  or any development which materially interferes with the normal public use of the water or shorelines of the state see rcw 3e for details see bmc  for exemptions from substantial development permits substantially degrade means to cause significant ecological impact surface or openpit mining involves either the removal of surface material overburden to enable the underlying mineral resources to be exposed and extracted quarried or the direct extraction of naturally occurring surface minerals and materials such as rock sand gravel and aggregate removal of sand from river bars is considered a surface mining activity   t threatened and endangered species or t&e species means those native species that are listed in rule wac 23212297 by the washington state department of fish and wildlife pursuant to rcw  as threatened wac 23212011 or endangered wac 23212014 or that are listed as threatened or endangered species under the federal endangered species act 16 usc 1533 transportation facilities are those structures and developments that aid in land and water surface movement of people goods and services including roads trails bikeways parking areas bridges and rail transportation   u upland means those shoreline areas landward of the ordinary high water mark except backshores natural wetlands and floodplains   v variance is a means to grant relief from the specific bulk dimensional or performance standards set forth in the applicable master program and not a means to vary a use of a shoreline   w waterdependent use means a use or portion of a use which cannot exist in a location that is not adjacent to the water but is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature of its operations examples of waterdependent uses include ship cargo terminal loading areas fishing ferry and passenger terminals barge loading facilities ship building and dry docking marinas aquaculture float plane facilities hydroelectric dams surface water intake and sewer outfalls waterenjoyment use means a recreational use or other use that facilitates public access to the shoreline as a primary characteristic of the use  or a use that provides for recreational use or aesthetic enjoyment of the shoreline for a substantial number of people as a general characteristic of the use and which location design and operation assures the publics ability to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of the shoreline in order to qualify as a waterenjoyment use the use must be open to the general public and the shorelineoriented space within the project must be devoted to the specific aspects of the use that fosters shoreline enjoyment primary waterenjoyment uses are as defined in wac 1732602040 wateroriented use means a use that is a waterdependent waterrelated or waterenjoyment use or a combination of such uses water quality means the physical characteristics of water within shoreline jurisdiction including water quantity hydrological physical chemical aesthetic recreationrelated and biological characteristics where used in this title the term water quantity refers only to development and uses regulated under this title and affecting water quantity such as impermeable surfaces and storm water handling practices water quantity for purposes of this title does not mean the withdrawal of ground water or diversion of surface water pursuant to rcw  waterrelated use means a use or portion of a use which is not intrinsically dependent on a waterfront location but whose economic viability is dependent upon a waterfront location because 1the use has a functional requirement for a waterfront location such as the arrival or shipment of materials by water or the need for large quantities of water  or 2the use provides a necessary service supportive of the waterdependent activities and the proximity of the use to its customers makes its services less expensive andor more convenient waterrelated uses include manufacturers of ship parts large enough that transportation becomes a significant factor in the products cost professional services serving primarily waterdependent uses and storage of watertransported foods other examples of waterrelated uses include the warehousing of goods transported by water seafood processing plants hydroelectric generating plants gravel storage when transported by barge oil refineries where transport is by tanker and upland log storage for waterborne transportation wetlands or wetland areas means areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support and that under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions wetlands generally include swamps marshes bogs and similar areas wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland sites including but not limited to irrigation and drainage ditches grasslined swales canals detention facilities wastewater treatment facilities farm ponds and landscape amenities or those wetlands created after  that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road street or highway wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas to mitigate the conversion of wetlands  purpose authority findings purpose title and short title  authority authority for development enactment and administration of this program is the shoreline management act of 197 chapter 9058 rcw   findings athe city council concurs with the state legislature in finding that the shorelines of the state are among the most valuable and fragile of our natural resources and that there is great concern throughout the state relating to their utilization protection restoration and preservation in addition ever increasing pressures of additional uses are being placed on the shorelines necessitating increased coordination in their management and development furthermore much of the shorelines and uplands adjacent thereto are in private ownership  that unrestricted construction on the privately owned or publicly owned shorelines is not in the best public interest  and therefore coordinated planning is necessary in order to protect the public interest associated with shorelines while at the same time recognizing and protecting private property rights consistent with the public interest there is therefore a clear and urgent demand for a planned rational and concerted effort jointly performed by local state and federal governments to prevent the inherent harm in uncoordinated and piecemeal development of shorelines bthe city council finds that there are two areas of shorelines within the city of burlington and its urban growth area consisting of the skagit river floodway and contiguous floodplain areas landward 200 feet from such floodways  and the gages slough wetland associated with the skagit river cthe city council finds that the gages slough wetland has been substantially altered and degraded as a result of the influence of urbanization lack of best management practices in both urban and agricultural areas and that a restoration monitoring and maintenance plan shall be included as part of this master program dthe city council deems the goals shoreline area designations policies regulations and procedures set forth in this shoreline management master program to be essential to the protection of the public health safety and general welfare of the people of the city of burlington and its urban growth

overview the city of burlington is somewhat unique in that the entire skagit river shoreline is fronted by a levee there are few identified or delineated wetlands located on the waterward side of the levee system limited development such as recreation and restoration are allowed waterward of the levees which establish the floodway gages slough is a series of connected wetlands that cross the city and the wetland area itself is subject to the shoreline master program as allowed by rcw 2dii the city has chosen not to place the wetland buffer into shoreline jurisdiction the gages slough wetland buffer area is established citys critical area ordinance and is gradually being restored of a series of buffer restoration maintenance and monitoring projects that do not extend into the wetland itself there may be the need to obtain a shoreline permit for upgrades to the wetlands themselves in the future if it is determined that sediment buildup has an effect on flood hazard mitigation for these reasons standards for wetland buffers and widths are handled by direct reference to the appropriate literature rather than providing details that are unlikely to be utilized if at a future date decisions are made to remove riverine levees because of installation of planned setback levees to increase the channel migration zone there may be the potential for wetlands to form and the appropriate best available science standards will already be addressed in the shoreline master program  iipurpose the purpose of these regulations is to ensure no net loss of ecological functions in wetlands and riparian corridors including gages slough and wetlands along the skagit river wetlands serve many important ecological and environmental functions and help to protect public health safety and welfare by providing flood storage and conveyance erosion control fish and shellfish production fish and wildlife habitat recreation water quality protection water storage education scientific research and other public benefits it is the purpose of this shoreline master program to protect these functions to prevent the continual loss of wetlands and where practical to enhance or restore wetlands functions and values it is also the purpose of these regulations to protect restore where practical and enhance fish and wildlife populations and their associated habitats in addition to their intrinsic value certain species of fish and wildlife represent important historic cultural recreational and economic resources many species serve as indicators of the condition of the environment and the quality of life that local residents have invested in enjoy and respect  iiidefinitions habitats of local importance include a seasonal range or habitat element with which a given species has a primary association and which if altered may reduce the likelihood that the species will maintain and reproduce over the long term these might include areas of high relative density or species richness breeding habitat winter range and movement corridors these might also include habitats that are of limited availability or high vulnerability to alteration such as cliffs talus and wetlands priority habitats are habitat types or elements with unique or significant value to a diverse assemblage of species based on the current and updated definitions by the washington department of fish and wildlife wdfw a priority habitat may consist of a unique vegetation type eg shrubsteppe or dominant plant species eg juniper savannah a described successional stage eg oldgrowth forest or a specific habitat feature eg cliffs in the case of the skagit river priority habitats include areas for migration nesting and rearing of juveniles priority species require protective measures for their survival due to their population status sensitivity to habitat alteration andor recreational commercial or tribal importance priority species include state endangered threatened sensitive and candidate species  animal aggregations eg heron colonies bat colonies considered vulnerable  and species of recreational commercial or tribal importance that are vulnerable in the case of the skagit river these include chinook salmon native cutthroat and native steelhead fish wetland or wetlands means areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support and that under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions wetlands generally include swamps marshes bogs and similar areas wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland sites including but not limited to irrigation and drainage ditches grasslined

including mitigation measures in conformity with the performance standards outlined below 1riparian performance standards riparian buffer areas shall be established from the ordinary high water mark as determined by a site investigation the intent of riparian buffers is to protect five basic riparian forest functions that influence instream and nearstream habitat quality these are arecruitment of large woody debris lwd to the stream lwd recruitment creates habitat structures necessary to maintain salmontrout productive capacity and species diversity bshade shading by the forest canopy maintains cooler water temperatures and influences the availability of oxygen for salmontrout cbank integrity root reinforcement bank integrity helps maintain habitat quality and water quality by reducing bank erosion and creating habitat structure and instream hiding cover for salmon and trout drunoff filtration filtration of nutrients and sediments in runoff surface and shallow subsurface flows helps maintain water quality ewildlife habitat functional wildlife habitat for ripariandependent species is based on sufficient amounts of riparian vegetation to provide protection for nesting and feeding and provide nutrient input to the aquatic system etc 2standard riparian buffers riparian areas have the following standard buffer requirements note riparian areas do not extend beyond the

protect maintain restore and limit future use of the property affected in perpetuity the terms of the conservation easement may include prohibitions or restrictions on access and shall be approved by the property owner and the qualified designee  appendix b shoreline restoration report ishoreline management act restoration principles the shoreline management act makes protection of shoreline environments an essential statewide goal with an emphasis on maintenance protection restoration and preservation1 local shoreline master programs include goals and policies for restoration of impaired shoreline ecological functions that are consistent with the principles embodied in wac 173261868c and d2 these principles include the following for cities containing any shorelines with impaired ecological functions master programs shall include goals and policies that provide for restoration of such impaired ecological functions these master program provisions shall identify existing policies and programs that contribute to planned restoration goals and identify any additional policies and programs that local government will implement to achieve its goals these master program elements regarding restoration should make real and meaningful use of established or funded nonregulatory policies and programs that contribute to restoration of ecological functions these components should appropriately consider the direct or indirect effects of other regulatory or nonregulatory programs under other local state and federal laws as well as any restoration effects that may flow indirectly from shoreline development regulations and mitigation standards local master programs shall evaluate and consider cumulative impacts of reasonably foreseeable future development on shoreline ecological functions and other shoreline functions fostered by the policy goals of the act the act also recognizes that restoration planning will vary dramatically between jurisdictions based on the jurisdictions size extent and condition of its shorelines availability of funding and restoration tools and the nature of the ecological functions to be restored aopportunities for protection and restoration in burlington potential areas of meaningful restoration are organized as follows 1shorelines fronted by an extensive levee system along the skagit river locations where there is significant open space between the levee and the rivers edge on land owned by the city or dike district no 12 including land outside the city limits johnson bar is the major site as identified in the skagit river big bend reach habitat restoration feasibility study3 future locations where the dike district plans to build setback levees farther from the shoreline 2gages slough wetland corridor wetland buffer restoration sites identified study  15 sites identified three restored and in maintenance and monitoring phase as spelled out in the gages slough management plan and related technical studies4 opportunities for public access locations for water quality enhancement projects to achieve the result of clean water coming out of gages slough into the skagit river to protect priority habitats and species listing id 7124 bacteria  category 4a for gages slough was moved off the 303d list on  when epa approved the cleanup plan known as a tmdl5 category 4a indicates that epa has approved a cleanup plan that is thought to be capable of returning the waters to category 1 meets tested standard the water is still considered impaired until effectiveness monitoring shows the conditions have been resolved the tmdl is very broad and does not include any specific program for gages slough management and cleanup the adopted gages slough management plan will be evaluated and work program components prioritized to enhance efforts to meet standards the gages slough management plan calls for getting the slough into public ownership from anacortes street to the skagit river the gages slough survey 2012 reinforces the need to make this happen as property owners are for the most part not interested in granting easements condemnation action is likely necessary bshoreline management program restoration and enhancement goals 1reestablish rehabilitate andor otherwise improve impaired shoreline ecological functions andor processes that are consistent with this master program and guidelines provided in other local and regional restoration plans 2encourage and facilitate cooperative restoration and enhancement programs between the city and state and federal public agencies tribes nonprofit organizations developers and landowners to address shorelines with impaired ecological functions andor processes 3restore and enhance shoreline ecological functions and processes as well as shoreline features incentivebased public and private programs 4target restoration and enhancement with the goal of improving habitat requirements of priority andor locally important wildlife species 5ensure restoration and enhancement is consistent with and where practicable prioritized based on the biological recovery goals for salmon populations and other species andor populations for which a recovery plan is available 6integrate restoration and enhancement with parallel natural resource management efforts such as the 2005 skagit chinook recovery plan6 and department of ecology water resource inventory area wria no 3 watershed planning activities cbiological goals and objectives these are the goals for the habitat conservation plan of the city so that any proposed activity does not appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the listed species under the endangered species act7 and that the plan minimizes and mitigates the impact of the taking of any listed species or habitat to the maximum extent practical 1preservation means acquiring a site using conservation easements donations etc to protect its current values land acquisition is in process for both the skagit river and gages slough corridors 2enhancement of a habitat means improving an existing site in some way that will encourage and retain fish and wildlife such as increasing pond size or improving buffer following land acquisition habitat enhancement is feasible public education is in process for encouraging land owners to use best management practices on their own property and to enhance habitat areas and values in their own backyards along the skagit river enhancement areas are johnson bar with potential for a major project and the forested buffer at whitmarsh fields where evergreen trees and maples are being planted to improve the buffer 3restoration means a damaged or degraded site will in some manner be improved athe gages slough corridor is the prime target for restoration projects there are a total of 15 sites in the gages slough corridor that have been identified and a reconnaissance level plan has been prepared for each one including locations for installation of bioswales adjacent to the wetlands for water quality enhancement the wetland restoration demonstration project in the jack doyle memorial neighborhood park is the first example the goldenrod bridge restoration project is in the fifth year of maintenance and monitoring located west of interstate 5 in a very visible location the unit 10 former city dump restoration site is in year two of monitoring and maintenance publicprivate partnerships are strongly encouraged balong the skagit river the threebridge corridor levee setback area is a longterm future restoration project opportunity 4longterm management of priority habitat sites includes strategies to protect the habitat values of the sites every site in the urban wildlife habitat designation has a monitoring and management plan that is tailored to the specific requirements of the location this work includes removal of invasive species and replanting as necessary in a timeline based on the season 5to not appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery is the statutory goal for permit issuance under the endangered species act in burlington this includes a strategy that will keep floodwaters out of the developed urban area so that pollution from the city does not enter the skagit river and prevent fish stranding in polluted areas with no potential for survival the city and dike district no 12 are working together to develop a plan for levee certification and accreditation by fema to prevent or at least severely restrict urban flooding in flood events up to the 100year base flood this project is the topic of an environmental impact statement8 drestoration and enhancement policies 1the city of burlington has determined priority restoration sites 2this master program recognizes the importance of restoration of shoreline ecological functions and processes and encourages cooperative restoration efforts and programs between the city county state and federal public agencies tribes nonprofit organizations and landowners to address shorelines with impaired ecological functions andor processes 3additional opportunities for restoration may be created when dike district no 12 completes plans to construct a setback levee along the skagit river threebridge corridor 4restoration actions should restore shoreline ecological functions and processes as well as shoreline features and should be targeted towards meeting the needs of sensitive andor locally important plant fish and wildlife species as well as the biological recovery goals for early chinook bull trout populations and other salmonid species and populations 5restoration should be integrated with other natural resource management efforts such as the 2005 skagit chinook recovery plan and the skagit river big bend reach habitat restoration feasibility study 2004 6priority should be given to restoration actions that acreate dynamic and sustainable ecosystems brestore connectivity between river channels floodplains and hyporheic zones crestore historic backchannels to create refugia for migrating fish dmitigate peak flows and associated impacts caused by high storm water runoff volume ereduce sediment input to the skagit river and associated impacts fimprove skagit river water quality water facility upgrades grestore native vegetation and natural hydrologic functions of degraded and former wetlands to the extent practical hreplant native vegetation in shoreline areas to restore functions where such actions are meaningful and consistent with this smp and dike district guidelines iwhere practical restore riverine ecosystem processes such as sediment transport and creation of sandbars and accumulation of large woody debris that create and sustain fish habitat the skagit is the only river system in washington that supports all five species of salmon containing some of the largest and healthiest wild chinook salmon runs in puget sound and the largest pink salmon stock in the state in all there are 10 species of salmonids within the skagit river basin these include six chinook stocks spring summer and fall pink salmon chum salmon sockeye salmon summer and winter run steelhead sea run cutthroat trout dolly varden and bull trout three of these puget sound chinook salmon puget sound steelhead and coastal puget sound bull trout are endangered species act esa listed9 as a result restoration planning in the skagit river watershed has had a focus on policies and actions intended to aid in the recovery of migratory fish populations in particular esa listed species eadaptive management plan an adaptive management strategy is used to address significant uncertainty associated with a particular habitat conservation plan but it is not practicable or possible to require that all adaptive management strategies impose an elaborate experimental design but rather to overcome data gaps as foreseeable circumstances change a contingency plan must be in place to address the issues an example here might be changes in the corps of engineers levee vegetation maintenance standards or a flood event that changes a planned restoration project fmonitoring program monitoring types include compliance monitoring effect monitoring and effectiveness monitoring today water quality monitoring is a tmdl and npdes ii requirement and there is ongoing monitoring at the sewer plant and at storm water outfall locations as well as in the gages slough corridor restoration planting projects have an initial fiveyear intense maintenance and monitoring program with less frequent visits as the sites mature mitigation projects will each have a specific monitoring plan  iiwatershed planning in 199 the state legislature passed chapter 9082 rcw which sets forth a framework for developing local solutions to water resource issues on a watershed basis rcw states the legislature finds that the local development of watershed plans for managing water resources and for protecting existing water rights is vital to both state and local interests  the development of such plans serves the states vital interests by ensuring that the states water resources are used wisely by protecting existing water rights by protecting instream flows for fish and by providing for the economic wellbeing of the states citizenry and communities rcw recognizes that watersheds are the logical planning unit for addressing water resource issues and the protection and restoration of fish and wildlife habitats the rcw establishes general criteria and guidelines for state agencies and local jurisdictions to follow in developing and implementing watershed plans the primary purpose of these plans is to equitably manage water resources between the competing demands of human use protection of existing water rights and the maintenance of instream flows for resident fish habitat restoration is an optional element in the development of local watershed plans under the rcw however given the requirements of the gma relative to the sma for shorelines restoration would be an expected component for those watersheds that have experienced significant development and historically supported significant fish populations and riparian habitats watershed planning is necessarily hierarchical in nature each major watershed is composed of smaller subbasins that may differ substantially in the intensity of development level of water resource use types and extent of habitats and functional characteristics federal and state agencies tribes and local governments have varying degrees of authority over watershed issues resulting in a hierarchy of plans and regulations major watershed boundaries and tributaries also cross jurisdictional boundaries requiring coordination between local communities tribes and private parties engaged in planning and restoration activities awatershed resource inventory area no 3 the states major watersheds have been mapped into 62 water resource inventory areas wria with each further divided into subbasins based on the physical extent of primary tributaries burlington is located within wria no 3  lower skagit river as a planning unit the boundaries of wria no 3 represent the upper tier of the watershed hierarchy for the lower skagit the department of ecology doe is the agency responsible for coordinating and overseeing the development of watershed plans under chapter 9082 rcw the doe further supports these efforts by conducting research and preparing studies on specific watershed issues reporting on watershed planning activities and maintaining a database of information specific to each wria bskagit chinook recovery plan 2005 the skagit chinook recovery plan plan was completed in 2005 as a joint effort between the skagit river system cooperative srsc and the washington department of fish and wildlife wdfw the process began in 199 in response to the listing of puget sound chinook salmon as threatened under the endangered species act and during its development included the involvement of a variety of interested and affected parties the plan document is intended to provide the basis for the skagit basin chapter of the greater puget sound chinook recovery effort the purposes of the plan are to define biologically based recovery goals identify what is known or assumed about factors that limit production of skagit river chinook propose scientifically based actions that will restore skagit river chinook to optimum levels including fisheries management artificial production habitat protection habitat restoration effectiveness monitoring and applied research the plan is built around the identification of four different juvenile chinook salmon life history strategies in the skagit yearlings parr migrants tidal delta rearing migrants and fry migrants due to the differences in habitat use yearlings and parr migrants depend more on freshwater habitat while tidal delta rearing migrants and fry migrants depend more on estuarine habitats this difference in habitat utilization by individual life history strategies shapes the habitat recovery actions proposed in the plan habitat recovery actions are recommended that benefit each life history strategy in an effort to maintain and strengthen chinook population diversity and ensure spatial connectivity and abundance the restoration strategy for the plan is based on an understanding of the limiting factors for each of the skagit chinook salmon stocks and the specific location of existing or potentially restorable habitat relevant to burlington are the plans recommended restoration actions for freshwater rearing habitat in large river floodplains tributaries and nontidal deltas large river floodplain restoration actions in the plan seek to improve freshwater conditions for all chinook salmon fry but in particular for those life history strategies that depend on freshwater habitat for extended rearing intact floodplain areas are especially important for freshwater rearing because the availability of complex mainstem edge habitat backwaters and offchannel habitat is essential for the foraging and refugia of all phases of freshwater life history for example stream type chinook salmon spend over one year in freshwater habitat before migrating further downstream cburlington wetland restoration program the flood hazard mitigation plan includes improving gages slough so that water can flow more readily during and after a flood event specifically considering sediment removal and culvert installations this planning effort will be more focused over the next few years and will comply with the shoreline master program technical studies have been completed for gages slough with important information about the existing conditions these include water quality monitoring as part of the lower skagit river water quality study completed in 199 the comprehensive surface water management plan adopted in 199 and the surface water management plan update and facilities predesign report completed in 1996 out of these initial studies three major actions took shape a coastal zone management grant provided funding for indepth technical studies of gages slough in 199 to set up a longrange management plan to facilitate removal of gages slough from its current listing as a 303d site in violation of the clean water act gages slough was moved off the 303d list on  when epa approved the cleanup plan known as a tmdl category 4a indicates that epa has approved a cleanup plan that is thought to be capable of returning the waters to category 1 meets tested standard concurrently a new pump station was designed and constructed to provide for storm water management as the city grows and to facilitate management of the hydroperiod of gages slough in response to the clear need for wetland restoration activities and the forecast demands of the comprehensive surface water plan a citizens advisory committee was formed to develop the shoreline master program for gages slough and the skagit river shorelines the problems associated with the degraded series of connected wetlands gages slough that crosses the community and concerns about the need for very costly storm water management facilities in the floodplain became the focus of every neighborhood meeting in the 1990s gages slough had become a combination sewer and garbage dump city staff was not aware of the history of gages slough and made the assumption that the upriver end of gages slough had some sort of direct connection via culvert into hart slough and reported that as a fact to the technical consultants however the culvert connects only to brickyard creek which is the ditched stream connected to the culvertfish passage there are no piped connections to gages slough the recent history of the area began with the construction of the sterling dam blocking any abovegrade connections to gages slough in 1899 because there were numerous floods that were affecting the railroad tracks the sterling dam is owned and maintained by dike district no 12 it is located north of sr 20 adjacent to holtcamp road in 199 a wetlands ecological study was completed for gages slough including delineation a functional assessment using the department of ecology hydrogeomorphic modeling approach along with a water level and water quality analysis and a management and restoration plan has been designed and integrated into this master program existing uses along gages slough include singlefamily residential commercial agriculture and industrial use the first survey of all the property owners along gages slough both in and outside the city limits was taken in the winter of 199596 and the results were mailed to all property owners in march of 1996 grave concerns about the future of the wetlands were expressed particularly in light of the fact that there was a significant flood event on the skagit river in the winter of 1995 and there was a lot of discussion about turning gages slough into a backup flood control channel these activities and issues led to creation of the citizens advisory committee and to the request for the grant funding to get the essential elements of the longrange management plan established a second survey of gages slough property owners was conducted in the spring of 2012 preliminary results have been tallied but results will still be coming in following publication of this report today the gages slough management plan has been adopted as part of the overall comprehensive plan the parks and recreation comprehensive plan and the comprehensive surface water management plan10 the plan was completed in the spring of 199 updated september 199 august 200 february 200 and followed by a 2009 gages slough reconnaissance report identifying a series of restoration project sites there are two wetland buffer restoration projects that are five years or older and there is one wetland buffer restoration project that was planted in 201 at the site of an old city burn dump as a participant in the npdes ii municipal permit system the public works department is actively increasing the focus on improvements to the gages slough corridor that enhance its ability to process storm water and return clean water to the skagit river system new improved water level monitoring instruments have been installed in gages slough bimonthly water quality monitoring is completed by the public works department in addition the skagit conservation district stream team has a committed team of volunteers that also does regular water quality monitoring in gages slough for temperature turbidity and fecal coliform the tmdl standards  iiirestoration opportunities and actions abig bend reach habitat restoration feasibility study 2004 the primary goal of the skagit river big bend reach habitat restoration feasibility study prepared for the city of mount vernon in 200 was to identify opportunities for improving the quality and quantity of rearing habitat available to juvenile salmon at various opportunity sites located in the big bend reach of the skagit river there are remnant pockets of habitat to be found between the river and the existing levees some of these are actively engaged with the river most are currently isolated from river actions except during high water events thirteen opportunity sites were identified and analyzed for their existing habitat values and their ability to provide additional habitat benefits extending from johnson bar downstream to britt slough johnson bar is mostly owned by the city of burlington and this is the only significant restoration site along the skagit river that the city has the potential to restore bgages slough restoration plans 2009 update this report provides an update on the identified restoration sites and sets a priority ranking for each site most of the sites have lots of invasive species including himalayan blackberry and reed canary grass and the need for shade and water quality improvement the drainage utility is committed to funding the fiveyear and ongoing monitoring and maintenance program since 80 to 90 percent of the citys storm water enters gages slough the sites are available as mitigation sites to compensate for decreased wetland buffers and for offsite mitigation under the critical areas standards cimplementation timelines benchmarks and strategies identify timelines and benchmarks for implementing restoration projects and programs and achieving local restoration goals 1the npdes ii storm water cleanup program is focused on public education water quality monitoring and source control maintenance this program is partially funded by the drainage utility and administered grant funds along with a dedicated team of volunteers from the conservation district the overall water quality is monitored by the department of ecology as part of the tmdl that includes gages slough the program is a permanent component  whether or not the water quality meets standards at some point the need for education and source control is critical as part of the fema community rating system program every drainage facility has annual inspection and maintenance requirements the city is committed to deliver clean water to puget sound  the benchmarks are set timelines are ongoing 2construction of water quality treatment bioswales in gages slough corridor for increased capacity to treat storm water this program is a top priority for storm water grant applications grant match funds are from the drainage utility the restoration sites have been prioritized based on water pollution and the first key location has a pending grant application all projects include five to 10 years of monitoring and maintenance  once mature maintenance needs decrease but there is ongoing maintenance and removal of invasive species 3wetland buffer restoration projects fifteen sites identified  three have been constructed and the remaining sites are available for public and private restoration opportunities this includes land development that requires wetland mitigation anywhere in this area two sites were constructed using donations to the burlington parks foundation the drainage utility has committed funds for the fiveto10year maintenance and monitoring program to date restoration activity has occurred at the rate of approximately one site every five years the commitment to permanent maintenance and monitoring is funded by the drainage
