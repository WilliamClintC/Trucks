former art iv pertained to flood control and derived from adopted  see the table for full derivation division 1  statutory authorization findings of fact purpose and methods statutory authorization the legislature of the state of south dakota has in statute sdcl  93615 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the yankton board of commissioners does ordain as follows the city of yankton south dakota elects to comply with the requirements of the national flood insurance act of 1968 public law 90488 as amended the national flood insurance program established in the aforesaid act provides that areas of the city having a special flood hazard be identified by the federal emergency management agency and that floodplain management measures be applied in such flood hazard areas the national flood insurance program was broadened and modified with the passage of the flood disaster protection act of 1973 and other legislative measures it was further modified by the national flood insurance reform act of 1994 the national flood insurance program is administered by the federal emergency management agency a component of the us department of homeland security  findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  and 6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  division 2  definitions specific definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common

some signs may create a traffic hazard by confusing or distracting motorists by impairing the drivers ability to see pedestrians obstacles or other vehicles they may also interfere with a persons ability to see and interpret any official traffic sign signal or device c second as a part of its police powers the city must also protect against damage caused by a sign a sign may present a danger to persons and property by way of collapse fire collision decay or abandonment d third as a part of its police powers the city has determined that this article should assist business owners who use signs to advertise their businesses if there are too many signs in an area then an existing business owner may have difficulty conveying a simple messages to customers customers may locate a business or service more readily with a sign signs also assist home owners because they identify residences and preserve the beauty of neighborhoods a sign also assists a business because it permits customer identification of the business product or service e fourth as a part of police powers the city has determined that the city as a whole benefits when there is not a clutter of signs or signs that do not meet a basic level of maintenance and use f fifth unmaintenanced signs can be a location for dumping or gather dirt or paper which may also create a fire hazard therefore the city has an interest in public safety g sixth the content of some signs may be immoral harmful to persons or businesses or further illegal activity as a result in furtherance of the citys police powers some content expression is punished but only that which the united states supreme court has held to be categorically suppressible h finally some forms of media present adverse unwanted consequences which may
