trees appreciably reduce the everincreasing and environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air c trees play an important role in the hydrologic

which passes ground from the surface to groundwater tables and the lower aquifers e trees root systems stabilize the soil and play an important and effective part in soil conservation erosion control and flood control thereby preserving stormwater and ultimately recharging the aquifers f trees are an invaluable physical and psychological addition to the village making life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling both air and land tempering the force of winds reducing noise levels and glare and breaking the visual monotony of development on the land g trees provide natural wildlife habitat and play other important ecological roles 2 the indiscriminate removal and destruction of trees causes increased village costs for proper drainage control impairs the benefits of occupancy of

determines as follows a land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  c clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation  e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow  f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality  g stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  h the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source

1133 purpose and scope a the area which this chapter applies consists principally of marsh and meadow land immediately adjacent to and crossed by tidal creeks and streams the greater part of which marsh and meadow land is covered with water during spring tides and during storms the development of this area involves many problems which do not exist elsewhere in the village and which directly affect the safety and health of persons who may live work or be present there the protection of their property and the protection of public improvements which may be located therein among such problems are 1 the flooding of the area to a considerable depth of water such as occurred during the hurricanes of 1938 and 194 which in case of recurrence might result in heavy loss of life and great
