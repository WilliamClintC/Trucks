inhibit or interfere with the public sanitary sewage systems intended and required functions cause physical damage to the structures of the public sanitary sewage system or cause hazard to those responsible for the operation and maintenance of the public sanitary sewage system or to the general public in addition the industrial discharges must be limited in amounts of specific contaminants of a toxic or polluting nature which may pass treatment system in objectionable levels as effluent constituents andor as a residue constituent of the sludge these rules and regulations are intended to provide the basis for this required control and protection of nbbsa property and responsibility it should be further understood that nbbsa and all industries are subject to the toxic and pretreatment effluent standards of public law 92500 the federal regulations pertaining to these federal requirements were developed by the federal environmental protection agency epa in 40 cfr parts 129 and 403 the epa regulations on pretreatment standards control the prerogatives of nbbsa in the control of industrial discharges and will always supersede the requirements of these rules and regulations where discrepancies exist in general an industrial waste shall be considered harmful to the public sanitary sewage system if it may cause any of the following damaging effects a chemical reaction either

public health and safety f obnoxious conditions inimical to the public interest all such wastes shall be prohibited from discharge to the public sanitary sewage system for all industrial waste constituents which are not compatible with the treatment systems andor will persist treatment systems as a pollutant or toxic substance pretreatment will be required to the extent the objectionable constituents are reduced to acceptable levels it is the current intent of epa to promulgate pretreatment standards for all known toxin and polluting substances on an industrial classification basis as these standards are developed they will become applicable to all industries according to a schedule also to be developed by epa epa standards are minimum standards which can be further altered to meet local conditions until these pretreatment standards become effective the prohibition and limits of hereof will govern 8 the variability of the rate of discharge from an industrial establishment is an important consideration of the compatibility of the industrial waste with the public sanitary sewage system and is also subject to regulation when the variability is considered excessive by nbbsa review or by epa regulation the industry shall employ methods and means to reduce the flow rate variability to acceptable levels for waste constituents compatible with the public sanitary sewage treatment system and for which the public sanitary sewage treatment system is to provide specific removal capability the industrial waste shall be subject to surcharge for such constituent

charges shall be on a water usage and flat rate basis in accordance with nbbsas sewer rate schedule nbbsa may if it deems it advisable elect at some time in the future to impose in whole or in part the sewage collection transportation and treatment charges on such other basis as it may determine when water usage is used as the basis for said charges the volume of water to be used for billing purposes shall be based upon water meter readings of the water authority or in the absence of such readings upon estimates made by nbbsa or flat rate charges when water usage is used as the basis of charges then if an owner or user obtains part or all of the water used in or on a property from sources other than the water authority such owner or user may after written approval from nbbsa at no expense to nbbsa or the water authority install and maintain a water meter or meters satisfactory to nbbsa and the water authority for measuring all water used other than that obtained from the water authority and the quantity of water used to determine the sewage collection transportation and treatment charges shall be the quantity of water measured by all such meters plus the quantity of water obtained from the water authority in lieu of such additional meters nbbsa may establish under the sewer rate schedule a flat rate charge which shall be applicable to such nonmetered water usage when water usage is used as the basis of charges then if it is established to the satisfaction of nbbsa that a portion of the water used in or on any property served by the public sanitary sewage system does not and cannot enter said system and in the event that the total water used in or on said property exceeds 100000 gallons per quarter nbbsa may determine in such manner and by such method as it may deem practical the percentage of the water entering the public sanitary sewage system or nbbsa may require or permit the installation of additional meters in such manner as to determine either the quantity of water excluded from the public sanitary sewage system or the quantity of water sewage or industrial waste actually entering the public sanitary sewage system in such case the sewage collection transportation and treatment charge shall be based upon the quantity of water estimated measured or computed by nbbsa to be actually entering the public sanitary sewage system when water usage is used as the basis of charges then any person requesting consideration for a reduction of the amount of the sewage collection transportation and treatment charges because of water not entering the public sanitary sewage system shall make written application to nbbsa for such consideration giving the name of such person his address and setting forth supporting data fully describing other sources of water if any as well as the disposition of water alleged not to be entering the public sanitary sewage system the application shall be accompanied by a sketch to approximate scale showing

nbbsas sewer rate schedule and shall be payable as therein provided the concentration of the applicable surcharge constituents of any industrial waste shall be determined not less than once per year as nbbsa shall determine from samples taken either at the manhole or manholes or metering chamber referred to in hereof or at any other sampling point mutually agreed upon by nbbsa and the producer of such waste the frequency and duration of the sampling period shall be such as in the opinion of nbbsa will permit a reasonably reliable determination of the average composition of such waste exclusive of storm water runoff samples shall be collected or their collection supervised by a representative of nbbsa and shall be in proportion to the flow of waste exclusive of storm water runoff and composited for analysis in accordance with the latest edition of standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater cited above except as hereinafter provided the strength of the waste so found by analysis shall be used for establishing the surcharge or surcharges however nbbsa may if it so elects accept the results of routine sampling and analyses by the producer of such wastes in lieu of making its own sampling and analyses the specific requirements for monitoring the waste flow for surcharge constituent strength will be determined at the time of the industrial waste permit
