insure the maximum inperson participation of harpswell voters at the annual town meeting an important aspect of the towns historical tradition 12 allow maximum voter participation to present opportunities for all voters to cast their ballots for certain items that are appropriate for placement on a secret ballot including items that should be decided before the next annual town meeting context the town meeting form of government allows voters to debate and decide policies that will guide the community for the following year however certain factors inhibit participation by some voters confinement to home temporary absence from town employment obligations child care responsibilities and sometimes the length of the meetings  a special hardship on older and infirm voters the select board wishes to encourage inperson participation at the annual town meeting by insuring that its length does not discourage that participation it also wishes to provide voting opportunities for those who cannot attend the annual town meeting limitations nothing in this policy restricts the select board in its discretion from making any decision regarding the placement or nonplacement of any item on a secret ballot this policy is intended as guidance to the select board as it makes those decisions it does not apply to decisions that the select board has the authority to make on its own public information and debate should the select board decide to place an item on a secret ballot it will notify the voters maximize the opportunity for discussion and dissemination of information and shall hold a public hearing in accordance with state law at which 1 the item will be explained by the board and the committee recommending the item and 2 voters will have the opportunity to express support or opposition to the item the hearing should be recorded and broadcast on harpswell community television to further inform the voters sufficient advance public notice should be given if possible to allow voter comment about the item in local newspapers considerations the following considerations should guide the select board in the placement of items on a secret ballot an affirmative answer supports the use of a secret ballot while a particular item may not involve each consideration the overall findings should provide the basis for a board decision has the item or a substantially similar item been thoroughly debated at the annual town meeting within the past three years has the item been approved or defeated by a substantial margin in the most recent annual town meeting does the item involve the expenditure of a substantial amount of town funds does the item involve a significant change to an existing policy or a new policy that will affect the future of the town does the item involve substantive changes in town government 29 does the item involve substantive changes affecting the towns natural resources such as ground water or waterfront development does the item involve bonding obligations for items involving the budget can budget limitations be appropriately dealt with at town meeting if the vote on the item is not determined until after the close of floor actions at town meeting if in the best interests of the town the item requires a decision before the next annual town meeting the considerations listed above should be part of the consideration as to

of selectmen  debt management policy background the town of harpswell invests in capital assets including buildings roads and other infrastructure assets land and landings vehicles and equipment the town has a 5 year capital plan for the maintenance and replacement of existing assets in preparing the capital plan consideration was given to future needs and projects to finance these plans the town may borrow or it may fund them from reserves established over a number of years and periodically increased from taxpayers generally the town has participated in maine municipal bond bank issues to fund longterm projects although on occasion the town has requested bids from other financial institutions none of these individual borrowings have exceeded $15 million at the time of issuance and each has been or is scheduled to be repaid within 10 years purpose the goal of this policy is to provide a guide for managing debt levels this includes evaluating the need for capital investment versus the capacity to pay for financing the costs of meeting those needs the focus of the policy is to measure debt secured by the full faith and credit of the town general obligation bonds which support the debt service this policy also covers lease purchases as they are similarly secured the town shall maintain an outstanding general obligation debt level that complies with state law which currently limits outstanding longterm debt to 15% of the state assessed valuation of the town however the target debt level of the town will be of 1% of this valuation the town shall not issue longterm debt to fund current or ongoing operations of the town those operations may be funded by tax anticipation notes issued in compliance with state law and in conformance with internal revenue service regulations the town shall not lend its borrowing capacity to or guarantee debt of any other entity maturity of debt obligations must be no more than the useful life of the capital investment being financed but in no case more than 20 years to the extent reasonably possible new issuances of debt will take advantage of the scheduled declines in existing debt principal planning for new capital investment will include analysis of the impact on the debt service schedule if a significant new borrowing is identified for the near future other capital needs will be evaluated relative to existing reserves and the capacity to appropriate funds considered further lower priority capital investments may be deferred or downsized 38 debt limitations borrowing capacity will be evaluated using a number of factors need  the capital plan will identify most needs however unforeseen opportunities may arise which require capital investment capacity  the maximum amount to be borrowed at any time will be determined by evaluating the following factors current and projected annual debt service market conditions including interest rates economic conditions including construction costs opportunities for participation in low interest financing programs grant opportunities or other situations beneficial to the town affordability  annual debt service impacts for each borrowing will be projected both in terms of the municipal budget and the impact on the taxpayer debt service payments should not exceed 8% of general fund expenditures total outstanding longterm debt should not exceed 10% of the state assessed valuation of the town term  financing should be secured with the goal of paying it back over a term that is of the greatest benefit to the town it may be equal to the expected life of the asset but may also consider the benefit gained by future taxpayers payments  payments will generally be structured with level principal and declining interest over the term except where other structures may offer economic benefit to the town  opportunities for refunding will be considered in light of changes in the economic environment direct issuances as the town identifies larger capital projects it may wish to issue town of harpswell bonds directly to the public market bond ratings  as the town considers bond issues whose magnitude may provide opportunity for cost savings to the town if direct issuance is chosen the town will be rated by agencies specializing in the analysis of organizations abilities to repay their debt it is the goal of the town to obtain the highest possible rating so that favorable interest rates and ease of entry to the market may be obtained this policy in conjunction with other fiscal policies of the town overall fiscal management and reliable reporting are critical in achieving a beneficial rating debt issuance  the town may rely on the sale of bonds for certain large borrowing needs these sales will be conducted use of financial advisory firm and quality bond counsel this allows the town continued access to the bond market and ensures compliance with securities and exchange commission municipal securities rulemaking board and irs regulations the town will comply with the ongoing disclosure requirements of the municipal securities rulemaking board adopted by the board of selectmen  39 disposition of tax acquired property policy adopted

be charged for a particular service that benefits the party paying the fee in a manner not shared by other members of the public in other words a fee may not be charged for general services that are mandatory or supplied to the public at large a fee is paid by choice the person paying the fee must have the option of not using the service and thereby avoiding the charge any fee however may be waived by the board of selectmen in the event of special circumstances a fee cannot be used to raise revenues generally but to compensate the town for its expenses in providing the service the town of harpswell assesses fees for certain services which benefit certain users more than taxpayers generally historically these services involve the harbormaster supported by the town clerks office the codes enforcement office the planner and the transfer station the services provided include the management of moorings the issuance of land use including wharf applications and plumbing permits planning board and board of appeals reviews and the disposal of materials not considered to be general household waste additionally shellfish harvesters are charged a fee to obtain a shellfish license and those who use the potts point float to tie up their dinghy pay a fee further the recreation department charges those who participate in its programs and fees are charged for the use of certain town properties establishing fees the town establishes fees by first estimating the amount of time the respective departments spend on the identified services the second step is to estimate the portion of that time directed to specific parties rather than the general taxpayer in addition to wages and salaries the town includes the associated employee benefits certain other items in the departments budget and if applicable a portion of the capital costs associated with the service additionally a general overhead estimate is applied generally speaking the towns fee levels do not cover 100% of the cost of the service on a case by case basis the town estimates what general benefit of the service should be covered by the taxpayer rather than a user the resulting costs are compared to the towns existing fee schedule and to fees charged by other towns for these services this information is reviewed with the budget advisory committee and then submitted to the board of selectmen for decision making the process is completed at least once every five years or when circumstances change adopted by the board of selectmen  43 fixed asset policy this policy establishes the minimum cost

insure the maximum inperson participation of harpswell voters at the annual town meeting an important aspect of the towns historical tradition 12 allow maximum voter participation to present opportunities for all voters to cast their ballots for certain items that are appropriate for placement on a secret ballot including items that should be decided before the next annual town meeting context the town meeting form of government allows voters to debate and decide policies that will guide the community for the following year however certain factors inhibit participation by some voters confinement to home temporary absence from town employment obligations child care responsibilities and sometimes the length of the meetings  a special hardship on older and infirm voters the select board wishes to encourage inperson participation at the annual town meeting by insuring that its length does not discourage that participation it also wishes to provide voting opportunities for those who cannot attend the annual town meeting limitations nothing in this policy restricts the select board in its discretion from making any decision regarding the placement or nonplacement of any item on a secret ballot this policy is intended as guidance to the select board as it makes those decisions it does not apply to decisions that the select board has the authority to make on its own public information and debate should the select board decide to place an item on a secret ballot it will notify the voters maximize the opportunity for discussion and dissemination of information and shall hold a public hearing in accordance with state law at which 1 the item will be explained by the board and the committee recommending the item and 2 voters will have the opportunity to express support or opposition to the item the hearing should be recorded and broadcast on harpswell community television to further inform the voters sufficient advance public notice should be given if possible to allow voter comment about the item in local newspapers considerations the following considerations should guide the select board in the placement of items on a secret ballot an affirmative answer supports the use of a secret ballot while a particular item may not involve each consideration the overall findings should provide the basis for a board decision has the item or a substantially similar item been thoroughly debated at the annual town meeting within the past three years has the item been approved or defeated by a substantial margin in the most recent annual town meeting does the item involve the expenditure of a substantial amount of town funds does the item involve a significant change to an existing policy or a new policy that will affect the future of the town does the item involve substantive changes in town government 29 does the item involve substantive changes affecting the towns natural resources such as ground water or waterfront development does the item involve bonding obligations for items involving the budget can budget limitations be appropriately dealt with at town meeting if the vote on the item is not determined until after the close of floor actions at town meeting if in the best interests of the town the item requires a decision before the next annual town meeting the considerations listed above should be part of the consideration as to whether at a special town meeting to hold a referendum or act on the floor adopted by the select board on  public participation at selectmens meetings meetings of the harpswell board of selectmen are

town has a 5 year capital plan for the maintenance and replacement of existing assets in preparing the capital plan consideration was given to future needs and projects to finance these plans the town may borrow or it may fund them from reserves established over a number of years and periodically increased from taxpayers generally the town has participated in maine municipal bond bank issues to fund longterm projects although on occasion the town has requested bids from other financial institutions none of these individual borrowings have exceeded $15 million at the time of issuance and each has been or is scheduled to be repaid within 10 years purpose the goal of this policy is to provide a guide for managing debt levels this includes evaluating the need for capital investment versus the capacity to pay for financing the costs of meeting those needs the focus of the policy is to measure debt secured by the full faith and credit of the town general obligation bonds which support the debt service this policy also covers lease purchases as they are similarly secured the town shall maintain an outstanding general obligation debt level that complies with state law which currently limits outstanding longterm debt to 15% of the state assessed valuation of the town however the target debt level of the town will be of 1% of this valuation the town shall not issue longterm debt to fund current or ongoing operations of the town those operations may be funded by tax anticipation notes issued in compliance with state law and in conformance with internal revenue service regulations the town shall not lend its borrowing capacity to or guarantee debt of any other entity maturity of debt obligations must be no more than the useful life of the capital investment being financed but in no case more than 20 years to the extent reasonably possible new issuances of debt will take advantage of the scheduled declines in existing debt principal planning for new capital investment will include analysis of the impact on the debt service schedule if a significant new borrowing is identified for the near future other capital needs will be evaluated relative to existing reserves and the capacity to appropriate funds considered further lower priority capital investments may be deferred or downsized 38 debt limitations borrowing capacity will be evaluated using a number of factors need  the capital plan will identify most needs however unforeseen opportunities may arise which require capital investment capacity  the maximum amount to be borrowed at any time will be determined by evaluating the following factors current and projected annual debt service market conditions including interest rates economic conditions including construction costs opportunities for participation in low interest financing programs grant opportunities or other situations beneficial to the town affordability  annual debt service impacts for each borrowing will be projected both in terms of the municipal budget and the impact on the taxpayer debt service payments should not exceed 8% of general fund expenditures total outstanding longterm debt should not exceed 10% of the state assessed valuation of the town term  financing should be secured with the goal of paying it back over a term that is of the greatest benefit to the town it may be equal to the expected life of the asset but may also consider the benefit gained by future taxpayers payments  payments will generally be structured with level principal and declining interest over the term except where other structures may offer economic benefit to the town  opportunities for refunding will be considered in light of changes in the economic environment direct issuances as the town identifies larger capital projects it

be charged for a particular service that benefits the party paying the fee in a manner not shared by other members of the public in other words a fee may not be charged for general services that are mandatory or supplied to the public at large a fee is paid by choice the person paying the fee must have the option of not using the service and thereby avoiding the charge any fee however may be waived by the board of selectmen in the event of special circumstances a fee cannot be used to raise revenues generally but to compensate the town for its expenses in providing the service the town of

codes enforcement office the planner and the transfer station the services provided include the management of moorings the issuance of land use including wharf applications and plumbing permits planning board and board of appeals reviews and the disposal of materials not considered to be general household waste additionally shellfish harvesters are charged a fee to obtain a shellfish license and those who use the potts point float to tie up their dinghy pay a fee further the recreation department charges those who participate in its programs and fees are charged for the use of certain town properties establishing fees the town establishes fees by first estimating the amount of time the respective departments spend on the identified services the second step is to estimate the portion of that time directed to specific parties rather than the general taxpayer in addition to wages and salaries the town includes the associated employee benefits certain other items in the departments budget and if applicable a portion of the capital costs associated with the service additionally a general overhead estimate is applied generally speaking the towns fee levels do not cover 100% of the cost of the service on a case by case basis the town estimates what general benefit of the service should be covered by the taxpayer rather than a user the resulting costs are compared to the towns existing fee schedule and to fees charged by other towns for these services this information is reviewed with the budget advisory committee and then submitted to the board of selectmen for

date citizens note disputed decisions may be appealed to the board of appeals 2 whenever a new enlarged or replacement foundation is constructed under a nonconforming structure the structure and new foundation must be placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the officer basing the decision on the criteria specified in relocation if the completed foundation does not extend beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure except for expansion in conformity with further limitations and the foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated by more than three 3 additional feet as measured from the uphill side of the structure from original ground level to the bottom of the first floor sill it shall not be considered to be an

damage destruction or removal and provided that such replacement or reconstruction is in compliance with the setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the officer in accordance with the purposes of this no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its nonconformity any reconstruction or replacement approved by the officer pursuant to this subsection shall be endorsed in writing by the officer if the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure except as allowed pursuant to above as determined by the nonconforming floor area and volume of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location if the total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be 8 replaced or constructed at less than the

plan shall be developed based on the following four step design process and the steps shall be documented applicants shall submit a plan that is the end result of this process but may be asked by the planning board to submit four 4 separate sketch maps indicating the findings resulting from each step of the design process in deciding whether it is necessary to submit separate sketch maps for each of the steps listed above the planning board shall consider the size of the parcel and whether the site includes a significant amount of environmentally sensitive areas the following four 4 step design process is intended to allow the developer the full potential of the legally allowable number of lots while at the same time preserving valuable natural resources and open space 31 step 1 of the 4 step design process delineation of natural resource or conservation areas a identify the portions of the parcel that have significant development restrictions due to natural constraints primary conservation areas or that have significant natural or cultural 11 resource value secondary conservation areas based on the site analysis b if the applicant is proposing a flexible lot size subdivision calculate the area of required open space in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance c if the applicant is proposing a flexible lot size subdivision designate the proposed location of open spaces on the conceptual subdivision plan based on this should be done on the basis of practical considerations related to the tracts configuration its context to resource areas on neighboring properties the priorities listed in open space areas and the applicants subdivision objectives d if the applicant is not proposing a flexible lot size subdivision designate areas that are not appropriate for development as dwelling sites and adjacent areas roads and other structural improvements 32 step 2 of the 4 step design process location of dwelling sites potential dwelling sites shall be tentatively located using the results of step 1 as a base as well as other relevant data from the site analysis such as topography and soils dwelling sites should generally be located not closer than one hundred 100 feet from primary conservation areas and fifty 50 feet from secondary conservation areas taking into consideration the potential negative impacts of residential development on such areas as well as the potential positive benefits of such locations to provide attractive views and visual settings for residences in addition the dwelling sites should be located taking into account the location of existing dwellings on lots adjacent to the subdivision the character of the area between the existing dwellings and the potential dwelling sites and the potential for negative impacts on existing dwellings the location of the dwelling sites in a flexible lot size subdivision should avoid concentrating units in the portions of the site immediately adjacent to existing dwellings outside of the subdivision 33 step 3 of the 4 step design process alignment of streets upon designating the dwelling sites a street plan shall be designed to provide vehicular access to each dwelling and bearing a logical relationship to topographic conditions impacts of the street plan on natural resources or proposed conservation lands shall be minimized particularly with respect to crossing environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands and traversing slopes exceeding twenty percent 20% street connections shall generally be encouraged to minimize the number of new culdesacs

one hundred fifty 150 feet  flag lots and other odd shape lots in which narrow strips are joined to other parcels in order to meet minimum lot size requirements are prohibited in twoacre lot size subdivisions  flexible lot size subdivisions  the applicant may propose and the planning board may approve a subdivision design in which the lots are smaller and have less road frontage than required for a twoacre lot size subdivision and in which at least half of the parcel is preserved as open space in accordance with the provisions of this purpose  the purposes of the flexible lot size subdivision provisions are to 1 provide the property owner or subdivider with flexibility in the design and layout of a subdivision recognizing the development constraints for twoacre lot size subdivisions in many areas of the community 2 allow for the creation of developments with a stronger neighborhood character and 3 provide for the permanent protection of protected and common open space that is consistent with the towns long range goals for preserving the communitys natural cultural and scenic resources 2 maximum number of the intention in allowing flexible lot size subdivisions is that a property owner or subdivider can create approximately the same number of lots that they could in a twoacre lot size subdivision the maximum number of lots allowed in a flexible lot size subdivision shall be calculated based on the following formula the total area of the parcel minus fifteen percent 15% of the total area of the parcel minus land not suitable for development see  equals the net useable area of the parcel divided by eighty thousand 80000 square feet per unitlot equals the maximum number of units allowed in a flexible lot size subdivision if the applicant proposes to include workforce housing as part of the subdivision the maximum number of lots allowed shall be adjusted according to the density bonuses for workforce housing set out in of the basic land use minimum size of to provide property owners and subdividers with flexibility in the design of a flexible lot size subdivision there is no minimum lot size requirement subject to the following limitations 22 31  have their primary road frontage on an existing public road must have a minimum lot area of forty thousand 40000 square feet 32  for oneunit residential lots with less than twenty

flexible lot size subdivision shall conform to the following minimum frontage requirements front on an existing public road 150 feet per unit front on an existing private road 75 feet per unit front on a new road within the subdivision 40 feet per unit 5 lot shape  to allow flexibility in the design of the subdivision in accordance with the process laid out in there are no limitations on the shape of lots in a flexible lot size subdivision as long as each lot contains a suitable development site of an appropriate size to accommodate the anticipated development flag lots and other irregularlyshaped lots are allowed as long as they are consistent with the overall utilization of the parcel based on the site inventory and analysis and conceptual subdivision plan 6 sewage disposal  sewage disposal may be provided by individual shared or common subsurface sewage disposal facilities the components of the systems may be located on the lot which they serve or may be located off the
