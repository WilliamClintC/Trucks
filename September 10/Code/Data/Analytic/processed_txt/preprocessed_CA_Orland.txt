publishing company under the direction of randy l johnsen city administrator with assistance from tom andrews deputy city attorney and laura blevins city clerk the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 7 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a subjectmatter index with complete crossreferencing locates

ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this

these improvements andor the costs of the compensation measures b the city is authorized to levy fees where specific findings are made with regard to the need to expand facilities to maintain adopted levels of service mitigate environmental impacts andor to comply with city general plan policies and standards general plan policies and standards provide a reliable basis for levying fees or associated exactions since the general plan is acknowledged as the foundation document for all development requirements in the community c environmental impact mitigation is also a basis for the establishment of development impact fees  however the california environmental quality act ceqa may not be used as the statutory basis for the fee other enabling ordinances or statutes are required to be adopted prior to implementation of fees based on environmental concerns d in establishing the fee described in this chapter the city council has found the fee to be consistent with its general plan

act ceqa per a4 of the state ceqa guidelines ceqa c requires that written findings be incorporated in the record setting forth with specificity the basis for the claim of exemption this claim of exemption is made based on the finding that the fee is necessary to maintain current service levels within the orland planning area without such fees current service levels will decline within the

to the provisions of this chapter a the city council finds that developers of property located in the city are often required to construct and install offsite underground canals incident to or as a condition of the approval or issuance of a final map parcel map certificate of compliance for a minor land division or a building permit which while necessary to serve development occurring on their property also adjoin other properties reduce the cost of additional development occurring on such other properties by eliminating the need for the construction and installation of such underground

in the city which directly benefit such properties because such underground canals benefit adjoining properties the city council finds that it is equitable and proper to assess and levy a fee on the owners of such properties incident to and as a condition of additional development occurring on the properties in an amount equal to each propertys proportional share of the cost of constructing and installing the underground canals and to use the revenue derived from such fees for the purpose of reimbursing the initial developer andor the city for the cost of constructing and installing that part of such underground canals which benefit such adjoining properties by reason of the foregoing the city council determines that there is a reasonable relationship between the underground canals the costs of which will be reimbursed with the fees assessed and levied pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and the development upon which such fees are imposed b the city council finds that the revenues from the underground canals reimbursement fees assessed and levied pursuant to the provisions of this chapter will be used to reimburse developers andor the city as and for the cost of

this chapter the amount of underground canals fees assessed and levied pursuant to a memorandum of reimbursable underground canals costs approved by the city council for an initial developer andor the city in the manner provided by this chapter will be based on the product of the cost per foot of constructing such underground canals determined from the actual costs incurred by the initial developer
