documents relating to all of the above  the city council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the establishments or businesses further there are presently no mechanisms or inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain workers of certain sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments defined in this article engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than workers of other business establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments especially those which provide private or semiprivate areas booths or cubicles for viewing films videos live sex shows and those having physical interaction between workers and customers 4 offering and providing such private spaces encourages such previouslymentioned activities which create unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such businesses and establishments 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments including but not limited to syphilis  gonorrhea  human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids  genital herpes  hepatitis b  nona nonb hepatitis  amebiasis  salmonella infections  and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states 600 in 1982  2200 in 1983  4600 in 1984  8555 in 1985  and 253448  8 as of  there have been 51838 reported cases of aids in the state 9 from 1981 to june 199 the number of living persons testing positive for the hiv antibody with aids symptoms has risen to 73217 in the 28 states having confidential reporting requirements 10 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 of 1990 11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 12 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments where persons view adultoriented films 16 the findings noted in subsections b1 15 of this section and as set forth hereinafter raise substantial governmental concerns 17 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the business or establishment is run in a manner consistent with the good order health safety and welfare of its patrons and workers as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the business or establishment fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep information regarding current workers and certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working at such businesses and establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the dayto day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain workers who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23 the fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment establishment or sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article 24 commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities and counties in central florida where adult entertainment material is possessed displayed exhibited distributed andor sold for commercial purposes in the form of books magazines periodicals or other printer material or photographs films motion pictures prints videotapes slides computer digital graphic recordings or other visual representations or

straddle dancing or touching with customers 26 commercial sexually oriented businesses exist or operate or may exist or operate within the city or other nearby cities or counties in central florida where sexually oriented services are offered for commercial or pecuniary gain in the form of commercial physical contact escort services and other services providing sexual encounters the workers of such sexually oriented businesses operating in central florida engage in physical contact or touching with customers including but not limited to acts of prostitution or encourage or entice the customers to engage in lewdness 27 the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments occur at establishments and businesses which operate primarily for the purpose of making a profit and as such are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the good order health safety economy property values morals and general welfare of the people businesses and industries of the city a major industry which is important to the communitys economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring children to visit central florida attractions who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere not dominated by commercialized sexual themes 28 when the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are present in establishments and businesses other activities which are illegal unsafe or unhealthful tend to accompany them concentrate around them and be aggravated by them such other activities include but are not limited to prostitution pandering solicitation for prostitution lewd and lascivious behavior exposing minors to harmful materials possession distribution and transportation of obscene materials sale or possession of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons and property 29 when the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are competitively exploited in establishments and businesses they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients blight neighborhoods adversely affect neighboring businesses lower real property values promote the particular crimes described above and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations 30 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments often have exterior signs or exterior appearances that lower the surrounding property values and contribute to urban decline 31 in order to reverse urban blight the city has established a community redevelopment area pursuant to fs ch 163 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments that contribute to urban blight operate at crosspurposes with the community redevelopment area 32 the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments sometimes occur in establishments and businesses concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages which concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal activity unsafe activity and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community and creates additional hazards to the health and safety of customers and workers and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life commerce and community environment 33 physical contact or touching within sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments between workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases 34 in order to preserve and safeguard the good order health morals safety and general welfare of the people of the city it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners managers operators agents workers entertainers performers and customers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments 35 the potential dangers to the good order morals health safety and general welfare of the people of the city posed by permitting a sexually oriented business or adult entertainment establishment to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this article are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate 36 requiring operators of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep records of information concerning workers and certain recent past workers as well as customer contracts and other matters and materials will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by making it difficult for minors to work at or be customers in such establishments 37 prohibiting sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments from operating within set distances of schools religious institutions residences areas zoned or designated for residential use and parks at which minors are customarily found will serve to protect minors from the adverse effects of the activities that accompany such establishments and businesses 38 straddle dancing unregulated private performances and enclosed adult booths in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers and poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression 39 workers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than workers of other establishments and businesses including but not limited to a very high incidence of illegal prostitution or engaging in lewdness in violation of fs ch 796 operation without occupational licenses and illegal and unlicensed massage 40 physical contact or touching between workers of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and sexually transmissible diseases 41 the practice of not paying workers at sexually oriented businesses and requiring them to earn their entire income from tips or gratuities from their customers who are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in a high incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers 42 sexually oriented businesses involve activities that are pure conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a profit rather than speech or expressive activity and therefore are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health good order morals welfare and safety of the community 43 requiring sexually oriented businesses to post a listing of services provided and restrict services to those listed as well as maintaining a customer contract and transaction record in a daily register will discourage incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution thereby further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and will assist facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal acts do occur 44 the general welfare health good

roads streets sidewalks and bikeways  streets  streets a street classification system established streets in the city are classified according to function served in order to allow for regulation of access road and rightofway widths circulation patterns design speed and construction standards the function of a roadway is twofold one function is to provide access to land uses adjacent to the roadway facility  the other function is to provide mobility area as access to a roadway increases the ability of the facility to provide mobility to decreases roadway facilities designed for mobility generally have higher speeds and restrictive access controls facilities designed for mobility generally have more capacity than those designed for land access the hierarchy of streets is established based on and in accordance with the following categories and descriptions 1 limited access roadways interstates expressways freeways limited access roadways are devoted primarily to the movement of trips over long distances access from adjoining parcels is prohibited and access is limited to exit and entrance ramps located at major roadways this roadway is generally a multilane divided facility designed to serve large volumes of highspeed traffic 2 major arterial major arterials are designed for the movement of large volumes of traffic over relatively long distances they connect to other arterials or collectors and do not penetrate residential neighborhoods through traffic movement shall always take precedence over access to private property use of frontage roads and consolidation of access is strongly encouraged mobility is the primary function of this facility consequently access outs shall be strictly controlled 3 minor arterial minor arterials are very similar to major arterials but are designed to serve moderate volumes of traffic as well as provide connections to the major system this facility has a lower degree of travel mobility than a major arterial this type of roadway allows more land access than either limited access facilities or major arterials 4 major collector major collectors serve major community or regional facilities and carry collectors do not serve long but rather short to moderate length trips these routes also collect and distribute traffic between local roads or arterial roads and serve as linkage between land access and mobility needs 5 minor collector minor collectors have a function similar to that of a major collector except that they serve a more limited geographic area land service is generally a significant function of this facility 6 local local streets primarily exist to provide access to adjacent land uses average speeds and volumes are low and trips are usually short in length there is no emphasis on movement land

for purposes of this section the term nonconforming site features includes the following 1 nonconforming offstreet parking  land development  apopka fl  nonconformities nonconforming site features  interior and exterior remodeling of structures 2 nonconforming landscaping  and 3 nonconforming perimeter buffers b if an application is submitted for a building permit for the remodeling or expansion of a structure and the development site contains one or more nonconforming site features identified in subsection a above and the value of the proposed improvements totals at least 25 percent of the assessed value of the existing structure the applicant shall be required to address the nonconforming site feature as provided in interior and exterior remodeling of structures c if an application is submitted for a building permit for the expansion of a building or structure that contains one or more nonconforming site features identified in subsection a and the proposed area of the expansion over a fiveyear period exceeds at least 20 percent of the area of the building or structure over that fiveyear period the applicant shall address the nonconforming site features as provided in interior and exterior remodeling of structures d this section does not apply to 1 the reconstruction of a nonconformity damaged by a calamity  or 2 repairs for normal maintenance  interior and

site features identified in a land development fl  7  nonconformities nonconforming site features  interior and exterior remodeling of structures table b standards for nonconforming site features type of remodeling or expansion definition required compliance 3 remodeling costing between 25 and 75 percent of structure value remodeling of a structure in any continuous fiveyear period that costs more than 25 percent but less than 75 percent of the current assessed value of the structure action is required for the nonconforming site features identified in a to be upgraded towards compliance with the standards of this ldc by a corresponding percentage of full compliance up to achievement of 100 percent compliance example a nonresidential site with nonconforming offstreet parking site feature with an assessed value of $100000 is undergoing remodeling equaling $40000 40% of the assessed value the developer must add a corresponding number of additional required parking spaces until the site fully complies if the site at the time of remodel has 10 parking spaces but the ldc requires a minimum of 20 for the use that is proposed 10 more spaces are required for the site to be conforming the applicant would be required to provide 40% of the 20 spaces  or 8 more parking spaces bringing the total number of spaces on the site to 18 spaces 4 remodeling costing 75 percent or more of structure value remodeling of a structure in any continuous fiveyear period that costs 75 percent or more of the current assessed value of the structure action is required for all nonconforming site features identified in a to be upgraded to achieve 100 percent compliance with the standards of this ldc 5 addition and expansion additions or expansions to buildings structures or use areas on sites with nonconforming site feature see rows 6 below 6 additions and expansion less than 20 percent additions or expansions to a structure or use area in any continuous fiveyear period that increase the gross

identified in a 7 additions and expansions between 20 and 60 percent additions or expansions to a structure or use area in any continuous fiveyear period that increase the gross square footage of the structure or use area measured at the beginning of the fiveyear period by more than 20 percent but less than 60 percent action is required for the nonconforming site features identified in a to be installed or upgraded towards compliance with the standards of this ldc by a corresponding percentage of full compliance up to achievement of 100 percent compliance example under this ldcs minimum offstreet parking space standards an existing building if built today would be required to provide at least 40 parking spaces but the site only contains 20 spaces if the building is expanded by 30 percent of its gross floor area the expansion project must add 12 parking spaces 30% x 40 required spaces increasing compliance from 50 percent 20 of 40 required spaces to 80 percent 32 of 40 required spaces a subsequent addition whose size also equals 30 percent of existing building size might seem to call for addition of another 12 spaces 30% x 40 required spaces but actually only 8 new spaces would be required to achieve 100% compliance 32 + 8   40 spaces land development  apopka fl  nonconformities nonconforming site features  compliance to maximum extent practicable on constrained properties table b standards for nonconforming site features type of remodeling or expansion definition required compliance 8 additions and expansions greater than 60 percent additions or expansions to a structure or use area in any continuous fiveyear period that increase the gross square footage of the structure or use area measured at the beginning of the fiveyear period by more than 60 percent action is required for all nonconforming site features identified in a to be installed or upgraded to achieve 100 percent compliance with the standards of this ldc 9 generally the situations referred to in rows 1012 below apply to any structural alterations or expansions see rows 10 five or fewer parking spaces required as a a change in use remodeling project to install five or fewer additional offstreet parking spaces as a part of a change in use such additional offstreet parking is not required to be installed 11 additions and expansions of outdoor use areas only only outdoor operations storage and display areas are being added or expanded on a site the percentage increase in the gross square footage of the outdoor operations storage and display areas shall require perimeter buffers and screening to be installed or upgraded towards compliance with the standards of this ldc by a corresponding percentage of full compliance the increased perimeter buffer and screening shall be located so as to achieve the performance objectives in landscaping and buffer standards with priority given to screening the impacts of outdoor operations  compliance to maximum extent practicable on constrained properties where full compliance with the requirements of this section is precluded by a lack of sufficient developable area due to the area of the lot the layout of
