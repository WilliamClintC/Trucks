the village the topography of hastingsonhudson is hilly and characterized by steep slopes and rocky outcroppings construction on such terrain has the inherent risk of causing damage to the ecology b in the past the inability to build on such sites created a natural form of protection recent developments in the technology of construction have now exposed more sensitive sites to development and consequently potential risk to the environment in addition the scarcity of buildable land has made these sites more desirable c steep slopes are environmentally sensitive areas and a valued natural resource the planning board recognizes the need to protect these areas from any adverse effects of disturbance in order to ensure the public health safety and general welfare at the same time the planning board recognizes the need to achieve a balance between protecting the public interest and safeguarding the rights of property owners regarding the use of their land d steep slopes including vegetation and rock outcroppings located on them are important environmental features that contribute significantly to the visual impression one forms when traveling onhudson areas that are highly

controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing within the village of hastingson hudson and to address the legislative findings in  2501 above this article seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives a land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species c clearing grading excavating soil disturbance or placement of fill during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the village g stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities h the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety i regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural
