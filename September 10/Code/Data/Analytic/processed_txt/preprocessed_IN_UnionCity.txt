development are thus contained within the approved and recorded plan itself having been arrived at prior to rezoning pd zoning may be applied to existing development or to open land on small or larger tracts b the plan commissions goal is to provide a widening variety of environmentally appropriate residential nonresidential and mixed use developments to meet the needs of the community to help

to foster innovative and diverse design in land development that is still consistent with both the adopted comprehensive plan and the intent of the unified zoning and subdivision ordinances to achieve this the plan commission does not apply any other provisions of this the plan commission negotiates a specific development plan with the petitioner for pd zoning and representatives of the checkpoint agencies the combined elements of this negotiated plan rather than the zoning regulations then become the subject of the rezoning process all restrictions and regulations for a specific planned development are thus contained within the approved and recorded plan itself having been arrived at prior to rezoning pd zoning may be applied to existing development or to open land on small or larger tracts b the plan commissions goal is to provide a widening variety of environmentally appropriate residential nonresidential and mixed use developments to meet the needs of the community to help create attractive healthful efficient and stable places to live shop and work the plan commission encourages use of pd zoning within the following contexts 1 to accommodate compatible development in environmentally sensitive locations  2 to enhance compatibility with surrounding land uses  3 to permit a harmonious variety of uses within a single development  4 to promote efficiency and thus economy by clustering structures andor by using shared facilities or services  5 to foster new site treatments not contemplated in other kinds of zones 702 origination of proposals a a request to rezone from any other zoning classification to pd zoning may be initiated by 1 all owners of the property in question  or 2 any group of owners united in interest acting jointly in pursuance to an agreement to carry out the proposal in separate ownership b because of the unified design of a planned development and because the combined elements of the negotiated plan are the substance of the zone itself this ordinance requires that a request to reclassify from pd to pd shall include amongst the petitioners either 1 all owners of the property within the current planned development  or 2 the owners association acting on behalf of a majority of the property owners in the current planned development as constituted in the recorded bylaws c also in keeping with the provisions contained

as a mix of both residential and nonresidential uses  4 pdcc in which the only change proposed involves either a the conversion to condominium ownership of a development which has received occupancy permits for all parts no less than three years prior  or b the conversion to condominium ownership of an existing building in any zone  where there is no further division of land involved 704

 statutory authorization the indiana legislature has in ic 3674 and ic 14284 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions therefore the randolph county commissioners do hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations  findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of randolph county the city of winchester the town of farmland the town of ridgeville the city of union city and the town of parker city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction 3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters 4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 6 make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the county by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program  objectives the objectives of this ordinance are 1 to protect human life and health 2 to minimize expenditure of
