on a residential onefamily twofamily threefamily or fourfamily structure an airconditioning system may be designed by an installing airconditioning contractor certified under florida statutes to serve any building or addition which is designed to accommodate fewer than 100 persons and requires an airconditioning system with value of $50000 or less  and when a 15tonper system or less is designed for a singular space of a building and each 15ton system or less has an independent duct system systems not complying with the above require design documents that are to be sealed by a professional engineer example 1 when a space has two 10ton systems with each having an independent duct system the contractor may design these two systems since each unit system is less than 15 tons example 2

single water cooling tower the cost of the entire heating ventilation and air conditioning work is $47000 and the office building accommodates fewer than 100 persons because the six mechanical units are connected to a common water tower this is considered to be an 18ton system it therefore could not be designed by a mechanical or air conditioning contractor note it was further clarified by the

bingo title this article shall be cited as the orange city bingo   21098 legislative findings based on evidence and testimony presented at the public hearing before the city council on  the evidence provided by the metropolitan bureau of investigation of the ninth judicial circuit in florida and the findings incorporated in hernando county pasco county lake county the city council of the city of orange city finds and determines that 1 fs   was enacted by the state legislature as an exception to the gambling and lottery laws it authorizes charitable nonprofit and veterans organizations engaged in charitable civic community benevolent religious or scholastic works and other similar activities to conduct bingo games provided the entire proceeds derived from the conduct of the bingo games less actual business expenses for articles designed for and essential to the operation conduct and playing of bingo are donated to such endeavors 2 fs  2a prohibits the net proceeds from bingo games from being used for any purpose other than charitable nonprofit and veterans organizations engaged in charitable civic community benevolent religious or scholastic works and other similar activities 3 fs  2b provides that it is the express intent of the legislature that no charitable nonprofit or veterans organization serve as a sponsor of a bingo game conducted by another but such organization may only be directly involved in the conduct of such a game as provided in the statute 4 fs   contains various other provisions intended to assure that only the groups associations and organizations authorized by the statute are involved in the operating of or receive andor distribute the proceeds of bingo games but the present law is inadequate to fully achieve this objective because of a lack of regulatory authority as suggested by the twelfth statewide grand jury 5 fs   contains various other provisions intended to assure that the primary benefactor of the authorized bingo games is actually the charitable nonprofit and veterans organizations and not private persons but the present law has proved inadequate to fully achieve that objective 6 investigations by law enforcement agencies in orange city and other florida jurisdictions have demonstrated that a high degree of commercialization existed in bingo halls where bingo games were conducted seven days a week and that the bingo halls operated in effect as minicasinos where only a small amount of the proceeds of the bingo games were eventually distributed for charitable purposes those investigations revealed that in those commercial bingo halls the particular charitable organizations whose names were used as the alleged operators of the bingo games did not actually control the conduct of their own bingo games in an armslength relationship with the commercial operator it was discovered rather that the commercial operator usually controlled the games employees that were enrolled in the charity whose names were being used as supposed volunteers 7 law enforcement investigations in orange city and other jurisdictions revealed that the commercial operators controlled all the monies and proceeds of the bingo games and only forwarded very small percentages of the proceeds to the charitable organizations repeated instances were uncovered of monies and proceeds from bingo games being retained or used illegally or being diverted from the authorized charitable operator deducting extremely high rental rates from the proceeds to the charitable organizations or the commercial operator deducting a variety of expenses from the charitable proceeds for services allegedly performed by the commercial operator 8 the arrangements between and among lessors of places where bingo games are conducted actual or putative nonprofit organizations whose names are used and concessionaires at such games have become commercialized to an extent not contemplated or intended by the legislature this defeats the legislative goal of reserving bingo as an activity permitted only for recreation and charitable fund raising rather than as a private venture for profit 9 the commercialization of bingo and the resulting diversion of bingo proceeds to private persons and commercial operators results in a reduction of bingo proceeds which are actually donated to benefit the charitable civic community benevolent religious or scholastic works and other similar activities in the community 10 the twelfth statewide grand jury reported in october of 1995 after investigating the bingo industry that effective enforcement of the laws regarding bingo games can only be brought about by local regulation of these games to ensure that the proceeds from the games pass into the hands of the groups organizations or associations identified in fs   in the manner and for the purposes set forth in the statute the twelfth statewide grand jury has recommended that use of any location for bingo be limited to two days a week and that all bingo proceeds be deposited in separate accounts from which all prizes and expenses are paid 11 fs   does not contain any language preempting a local government from adopting regulations relating to the conduct of bingo games 12 orange city a charter city possesses the power pursuant to florida constitution and fs   to exercise its police power to promote the health safety and welfare of the people of orange city 13 orange city has a large population some of whom play bingo and many nonprofit charitable and veterans organizations which rely on legally obtained bingo proceeds 14 a need exists in orange city to provide for local regulation of bingo  21098 legislative intent a it is the intent of the city council of the city that all phases and aspects of the regulation of bingo be closely controlled and the law pertaining thereto be rigidly and strictly enforced and that the diversion of proceeds from bingo games from the purposes

regulate traffic or that are erected and maintained within road rights of way or adjacent property these uniform standards are intended to be used by owners of private property that is open to the public to reduce confusion and limit the risk of accident while these signs are content specific they serve an extraordinarily important public function  as noted in reed v town of gilbert id some content based signs are necessary to protect the public and are likely to survive strict scrutiny signs prohibiting trespassing or solicitors  warning of the dangers of high voltage or other hidden dangers may be required for a person to assert property rights or to protect a property owner from liability  the purpose intent and scope of its signage standards and regulations are detailed so as to further describe the beneficial aesthetic and other effects of the citys sign standards and regulations and to reaffirm that the sign standards and regulations are concerned with the secondary effects of speech and are not designed to censor speech or regulate the viewpoint of the speaker  the limitations on the size area height number spacing and setback of signs adopted herein are based upon sign types and the zoning districts for the parcels and properties on which they are located  various signs that serve as signage for particular land uses such as drivefor businesses are based upon contentneutral criteria in recognition of the functions served by those land uses but not based upon any intent to favor any particular viewpoint or control the subject matter of public discourse  these amendments are not in conflict with the public interest and will not result in incompatible land uses  objects and devices such as graveyard and cemetery markers visible from a public area vending machines or express mail dropoff boxes visible from a public area decorations that do not constitute advertising visible from a public area artwork that does not constitute advertising  a buildings architectural features visible from a public area or a manufacturers or sellers markings on machinery or equipment visible from a public area are not within the scope of what is intended to be regulated land development regulations that pertain to signage under fs ch 163  in 195 the united states supreme court recognized that the concept of the public welfare is broad and inclusive that the values it represents are spiritual as well as physical aesthetic as well as monetary and that it is within the power of the legislature to determine that the community should be beautiful as well as healthy spacious as well as clean well balanced as well as carefully patrolled  the sign control principles set forth herein create a sense of character and ambiance that distinguishes the city as one with a commitment to maintaining and improving an attractive environment  the beauty of the city of orange city both with regard to its natural and built and developed environment has provided the foundation for the economic base of the citys development and that the citys sign regulations not only help create an attractive community for its residents but also bolster orange citys image as a tourist destination and the goals objectives and policies from planning documents developed over the years demonstrate a strong longterm commitment to maintaining and improving the citys attractive and visual environment  from a planning perspective one of the most important community goals is to define and protect aesthetic resources and community character  the code is intended to lessen hazardous situations confusion and visual clutter caused by proliferation improper placement illumination animation and excessive height area and bulk of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic  protect the public from the dangers of unsafe signs  and to permit signs that are compatible with their surroundings and aid orientation and to preclude placement of signs in a manner that conceals or obstructs adjacent land uses or signs  the purpose is to curtail the size and number of signs and sign messages to the minimum reasonably necessary to identify a residential or business location and the nature of any such business  the sign regulations are intended to establish sign size in relationship to the scale of the lot and building on which the sign is to be placed or to which it pertains  to preclude signs from conflicting with the principal permitted use of the site or adjoining sites  and to regulate signs in a manner so as to not interfere with obstruct the vision of or distract motorists bicyclists or pedestrians  the sign regulations are intended to require signs to be constructed installed and maintained in a safe and satisfactory manner  and to preserve and enhance the natural and scenic characteristics of this community  the city agrees with the courts that have recognized that outdoor advertising signs tend to interrupt what would otherwise be the natural landscape as seen from the highway whether the view is untouched or ravished by man and that billboards are a form of advertisement designed to be seen without the exercise of choice or volition on the part of the observer unlike other forms of advertising that are ordinarily seen as a matter of choice on the part of the observer and it would be unreasonable and illogical to conclude that an area is too unattractive to justify aesthetic improvement  billboards are a traffic hazard and impair the beauty of the surrounding area and the prohibition of the construction of billboards will reduce these harms  see outdoor systems inc v city of lenexa  67 f supp 2d 123 1239 d kan 1999 the continued prohibition of billboards as set forth herein will improve the beauty of the city foster overall improvement to the aesthetic and visual appearance of the city preserve and open up areas for beautification on public property adjoining the public roadways increase the visibility readability andor effectiveness of onsite signs by reducing andor diminishing the visual clutter of offsite signs enhance the city as an attractive place to live andor work reduce blighting influences and improve traffic safety by reducing driver distractions anything beside the road which tends to distract the driver of a motor vehicle directly affects traffic safety and signs which divert the attention of the driver and occupants of motor vehicles from the highway to objects away from it may reasonably be found to increase the danger of accidents and agrees with the courts that have reached the same determination  by confirming in its ordinance that noncommercial messages are allowed wherever commercial messages are permitted the city will continue to overcome any constitutional objection that its ordinance impermissibly favors commercial speech over noncommercial speech the development services director dsd shall have the authority to make interpretations of
