loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated inadequately floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages passed 92115   statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 2016 s1 flood hazard areas 61 a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage e prevent or regulate the construction of flood bilrriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands f make federal flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program
