beverages which are in addition to those set forth in wis stat ch 125 and its general police powers set forth in  1121 carriage services  1151  wis stat  61341 to act for the good order of the municipality and for the health safety and welfare of the public  and its powers of regulation and suppression  and its lack of authority to regulate obscenity in light of wis stat  3 and does not intend by adopting this chapter to regulate obscenity since nudity in and of itself is not obscene declares its intent to enact an ordinance addressing the secondary effects of live nude nonobscene erotic dancing in bars and taverns and dance halls b purpose the regulations in this chapter are adopted because the village board recognizes that 1 bars and taverns and dance halls featuring live nude nonobscene erotic dancing have in other communities tended to further the increase of criminal and other offensive activity to disrupt the peace and order of the communities to depreciate the value of real property to harm the economic welfare of the communities and to negatively affect the quality of life of the communities and such secondary effects are detrimental to the public health safety and general welfare of citizens  and 2 the us supreme court has held that nude dancing is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the first amendment to the united states constitution and is therefore entitled to some limited protection under the first amendment and the village board further recognizes that freedom of speech is among our most precious and highly protected rights and the village board wishes to act consistently with full protection of those rights  and 3 based on the experiences of other communities bars and taverns and dance halls in which live nude nonobscene erotic dancing occurs may and do generate secondary effects which the village board believes are detrimental to the public health safety and welfare of the citizens of the village of waterford  and 4 among these secondary effects are a the potential increase in prostitution and other sexrelated offenses as well as other crimes and offenses  b the potential depreciation of property values in neighborhoods where bars and taverns and dance halls featuring nude dancing exist  c health risks associated with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases  and d the potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct  and 5 the village board desires to minimize prevent and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health safety and

sex offenders often commit many offenses have many more victims than are ever reported and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes this makes the cost of sex offender victimization to society at large while incalculable clearly exorbitant 2 intent a it is not the intent of the village board to punish sex offenders but rather to serve the villages compelling interest to promote protect and improve the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the village by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sex offenders are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence b due to the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders and because reducing both opportunity and temptation would help minimize the risk of reoffense there is a compelling need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places c the restrictions in this chapter are limited to and intended to apply to

invalid provision c intent 1 this article recognizes the need for wellmaintained and attractive sign displays within the village and the need for adequate business identification advertising and communication because of the unique qualities of the village of waterford which need to be protected and enhanced a high degree of control over the construction materials of signs is deemed to be an important public purpose 2 a sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification protection or directing persons to a use conducted therein must be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the principal use of land or building therefore the intent of this article is to establish limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the land building or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for their intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests identified in 1 of this section  24528 trees  24528  3

displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the village rather they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth above 3 these regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs rather they strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs 4 these regulations are not intended to and do not apply to signs erected maintained or otherwise posted owned or leased by this state the federal government or this village the inclusion of government in describing some signs does not intend to

to preserve the small town charm of the community b signs are one of the most prominent visual elements of a street welldesigned signs add interest and variety to building facades and help to attract customers in general the sign is the best representation of the business to the passing pedestrian or motorist the design guidelines shall be used as an important part of sign review and approval c before starting to design a sign take a careful look at the building is there an obvious space on the building where the sign would look appropriate without covering architectural details some of the  24529 trees  24530   24531 signage in nonresidential districts  permits required villages older buildings were designed with a horizontal sign space stretching across the top of the storefront which should be used if this sign space does not exist perhaps there is adequate wall area for a wall sign with appropriate space for a projecting sign d take a look at neighboring buildings is there a predominant type of sign or a size precedent in designing a sign it is important to have an understanding not only of the building but also of the compatibility within the neighborhood the basis for decisions on sign type size and location should come from architectural concerns the specific definitions and regulations governing the various types of signs in this section should be studied before actual design begins e to achieve the objective of these guidelines for sign details include the following 1 simplicity an effectively designed sign with bold easily recognized symbols and clear crisp lettering will identify a business or activity efficiently and attractively enhance the area in which it is located and complement the general appearance of the street and village 2 color restraint should be exercised when selecting colors on most signs no more than three colors should be used one for background a contrasting color for lettering and a third for perhaps emphasis such as for borders motifs or shading of letters to give it a threedimensional look colors should be chosen which complement each other as well as the general tone of the building 3 messages messages should be simple for rapid comprehension by the public pictures symbols and logos can add individuality and character to signs in addition to making them easier to read 4 materials sign materials shall be compatible with the surrounding area sign materials shall be consistent with or at least complement the original construction materials and architectural style of the building facade on which they are to be displayed 5 lettering lettering styles should complement the style and period of the building on which they appear traditional block and curvilinear styles which are easy to read are preferred
