hillside area overlay  sterling codifiers inc  344886 a description purpose and objectives 1 description certain areas of the city are characterized by significant natural features that include ridgelines bluffs rock outcroppings vegetation natural drainageways wildlife habitat geologic conditions and slopes that contribute to the attractiveness of the community 2 purpose the purpose of the hillside area overlay or hs is to specify conditions for any type of development to ensure that these areas retain their unique characteristics to safeguard the natural heritage of the city and to protect the public health welfare and safety it is the intent of these regulations to ensure that development within this overlay zone is compatible with and complements the natural environment as well as to minimize physical damage to public and private property it is furthermore the purpose of this section to allow a degree of development flexibility to protect the hillside environment many of these physical features if disturbed for the purpose of development can cause physical damage to both public and private properties development in areas designated as hillside area overlay requires special care on the part of both the public and private sectors review of development proposals for property within the overlay should recognize the various city the need to balance their application with the physical attributes of the property 3 objectives the hs overlay may be used with any zone district in the city when needed to meet the following objectives a to conserve the unique natural features and aesthetic qualities of the hillside areas  b to provide safe and convenient access to hillside areas  c to minimize water runoff and soil erosion problems incurred in adjustment of the terrain to meet development needs  d to assure type distribution and densities of development which are compatible with the natural systems the terrain and the geologic character of hillside areas  e to assure that the taxpayers of colorado springs are not burdened by extraordinary costs for services attributable solely to the development of hillside areas  f to encourage innovative design solutions which meet the purpose of the hs overlay zone district  and g to preserve wildlife habitat and wetland areas which provide wildlife migration corridors the characteristics of hillside areas mean that special care and consideration are necessary in the design of these sites the pud zone district allows for optimal flexibility in lot design lot size and building setbacks to conform most appropriately with the purpose of the hillside area overlay the pud zone district is preferred in conjunction with any proposed development in the hs overlay the use of the design flexibility overlay

city are characterized by intermittent and perennial streams which provide significant wildlife habitat riparian vegetation water quality protection flood protection open space and multiuse trail opportunities which add to the character attractiveness and quality of life of the community it is the purpose of the streamside overlay zone district to guide the development and maintenance of the property adjacent to these stream corridors in a manner that is compatible with the environmental conditions constraints and character of these areas 2 applicability the streamside overlay zone encompasses all land within the stream channel including stream adjacent wetlands and within a specified distance from the toe of the channel bank of specific intermittent and perennial streams within the city as represented by the official streamside overlay zone as shown on the city zoning map streamside overlay zone requirements are not applicable to those wetland areas that extend beyond the mapped streamside overlay zone district boundary however wetlands that are wholly or partially outside of the mapped streamside overlay shall be analyzed and protected as indicated or recommended by a land suitability analysis when required 3 objectives it is the objective of this section to protect and enhance streamside areas by promoting planned development within the streamside overlay zoned areas to the extent that those developments are found to be in accord with the streamside development plan review criteria and the streamside protection standards found in this section those parcels of land that have a significant proportion of streamside overlay zone are encouraged to consider establishing a pud zone district where density setbacks building height and other issues may be established which allow adequate use of the property while also meeting the streamside overlay zones requirements and review criteria if rezoning to pud is not acceptable the city may consider

planning and landscaping techniques which include the stream corridor as an amenity 3 has the project been designed to minimize impact upon wildlife habitat and the riparian ecosystem which exists on or adjacent to the site does the project design protect established habitat or any known populations of any threatened or endangered species or species of special concern 4 have existing or potential community trail networks and other recreational opportunities been identified and incorporated into the project design 5 has the project been designed to protect the subject property from potential flood damage and to accommodate flood storage and conveyance needs 6 have all significant natural features within the project streamside area been identified and has the project been designed to

neighborhood development tnd zone is to create a residential zoning classification that encourages a pattern of neighborhood development that was commonly built in colorado springs prior to world war ii these neighborhoods are characterized by a diversity of housing types integrated with neighborhood schools parks civic spaces and commercial uses this traditional pattern is based on a pedestrian environment that is more people friendly than auto oriented and incorporates attractive streetscapes parks and open space form a network of outdoor amenities that provide for recreation natural area preservation and pedestrian and bicycle transportation building design is architecturally distinctive enhancing the streetscape and creating a definitive character for the neighborhood street and walkway connectivity is to be achieved traditional block pattern or a reasonable equivalent overall the tnd zone is intended to promote the development of a neighborhood with a sense of place it also embodies many of the objectives included in the citys comprehensive plan   principles of traditional neighborhood development tnd the following principles are the primary concepts under which the tnd zoning standards and requirements are organized these principles are related to land use architecture and design streetscape and streets as follows a land use residential use is the basic building block of the tnd neighborhood tnds usually display a diversity of residential types styles and densities the diversity in housing type is important in order to provide a variety of choices to a wide range of households opportunities also exist for livework spaces and accessory dwelling units small projects may be comprised primarily of singlefamily dwellings while larger tnds may consist of higher density multistory development with commercial uses in a neighborhood center parks and open space are key elements providing nonmotorized transportation opportunities and amenity areas b architecture and design buildings define the streetscape by creating a vibrant more attractive street frontage buildto lines bring buildings close to the street in mixed use neighborhood centers front porches and garages accessed from an alley are usually the standard in residential areas parking for businesses and homes is primarily located behind buildings where parking for businesses is provided adjacent to the street it is subordinate to the buildings and is screened by walls or plantings vehicular access to parking lots is or driveways to shared parking lots c streetscape streetscape design plays a key role in defining the community image the tnd streetscape relates to the street and consists of landscaped tree lawns between curbs and sidewalks the adjacent sidewalks front yard spaces and the building frontages in addition to accommodating transportation needs the streetscape provides a public and semipublic space for street trees street furniture and view corridors contributions to a traditional streetscape include the design of buildings and parking and the connected network of streets alleys and sidewalks these are all planned together to create a pleasant as well as a safe and efficient experience for residents pedestrians bicycles transit and motorized vehicles d streets tnd roadways as well as pedestrianways are interconnected so that access for pedestrians cyclists and automobile drivers is direct and convenient this allows traffic to be dispersed variety of streets and ways so that the need for multiple collector and arterial streets is alleviated utilities are similarly interconnected with proper spacing and separation narrower streets designed with tnd characteristics result in slower moving traffic and provide a safer more pleasant pedestrian environment the residential streets in particular place at least as much attention to the people who live next to the street as on the vehicles that travel them tnd streets also encourage interaction among business people and residents   definitions these definitions are specific in application to tnds only activity area a space within the neighborhood that is used for recreation gatherings civic uses or neighborhood services such as a neighborhood center with retail and service commercial uses civic use in tnd an activity involving civic use types as defined in this zoning the exception of the following which are excluded from a tnd private clubs that do not allow public membership crematory detention facilities maintenance and service facility the purpose of a civic use in a tnd is to provide a neighborhood serving space as an amenity focal point a visual landmark it commonly identifies the neighborhood center and contributes to establishing the character of the development the focal point may be a statue a plaza a pavilion or some other structure or focused area that defines the heart or center of a development landscaped median that raised portion of a tnd avenue boulevard

comprehensive plan and as such is an early step in the land development process master plans provide a guide to various issues concerning development the master plan is legislative in nature and provides advisory land use and development guidelines to be used by the planning commission and the city council in their review of applications for rezoning plats or other land development review provided for in this zoning the subdivision this chapter conformance to an approved master plan will constitute a community benefit as described in the comprehensive plan this article recognizes the need for flexibility and that long term planning and consistency must be balanced with the need to amend plans as conditions change the intent is to permit changes to a master plan that conform to contemporary standards and current codes policies and plans an approved master plan shall be used by the city as a guide to zoning subsequent steps in the development process will establish more specific plans which shall be consistent with the adopted master plan master plans are intended to achieve the following objectives to the review criteria contained herein a to serve as a refinement of the comprehensive plan  b to encourage coordination in the provision of city capital improvements  c to serve as a guide for future land use and transportation patterns  d to aid the city in making annexation decisions  e to analyze the impact of proposed development on public facilities and environmental quality  f to analyze the proportional fiscal impact of the proposed development on the city  g to identify and protect significant natural features  h to assure coordinated implementation of adopted city and utility plans  and i to serve as an information resource for residents and developers concerning future land use patterns and related development issues               types of master plans a types of master plans the following categories of master plans are based upon the kind of information presented and the geography covered by the plan 1 citywide system plans these are planning reports that detail the existing and future needs for infrastructure and facilities such as open space parks transportation and utilities these plans are most frequently prepared by the city 2 facility master plans these are documents that detail the plans and the existing physical components of various public and private sector facilities examples include the colorado springs airport master plan and the penrose hospital plan 3 land use master plans these are plans for specific geographic areas these plans provide information about such issues as land use transportation open space parks and schools plans for undeveloped land are most frequently prepared by the private sector while plans for established or redeveloping areas are prepared by neighborhood organizations or the city either singly or collaboratively b legislative status of master plans the planning commission shall recommend and the city council shall determine the legislative status of each master plan the legislative status will identify those master plans that remain operative those that have been implemented and those that are out of date a recommendation concerning the legislative status will be made to the planning commission as part of an annual colorado springs comprehensive plan monitoring and evaluation report prepared by the community development department legislative status for individual master plans is categorized as follows 1 operative master plan a master plan that is less than eighty five percent 85% built out with some or all of the property zoned with a temporary zoning district there is continuous rezoning development plan and platting activity in conformance with an approved phasing plan built out is when a structure or structures have been constructed on platted lots  sterling codifiers inc  488886 2 implemented master plan a master plan that is eighty five percent 85% or more built out and the remaining vacant land is zoned in conformance with the master plan the redevelopment and neighborhood plans that are more than eighty five percent 85% built out and are being used as an ongoing guide will not be classified as implemented 3 out of date master plan a master plan that is no longer used because it has been either replaced by another master plan or no longer furthers the purpose of this part of this zoning provisions for public hearing notice and appeals of the planning commission decision shall be in accordance with part 9 notice

in the analysis to determine appropriate land uses in conjunction with the proposed annexation b waiver of master plan requirement it is recognized that with certain requests for annexation a land use master plan will not further the purpose of this part the manager may waive the submission of a land use master plan based upon a review of the following criteria 1 the land area under review is a small parcel of land which is less than thirty 30 acres and proposed for a single primary land use  2 the land area under review is part of an enclave with a well established surrounding development pattern  and 3 no major infrastructure or urban services are required based upon initial assessment of fiscal impact 4 when waived a concept plan development plan or subdivision plat shall be required to be submitted for review and approval in lieu of a master plan the landowner shall submit a written letter to the manager stating the reason for requesting the waiver and stating how the criteria are met upon review of the written request the manager may waive the requirement for a land use master plan if the criteria are met and a land use master plan would not further the purpose of this part to require a land use master plan c amendments master plans are generalized guides for development and it may become necessary to amend them as conditions change there are two 2 categories of amendments based upon their complexity and community wide impact the manager shall determine if an amendment is major or minor based upon the following 1 major amendment this is a requested change that potentially has a significant impact upon one or all of the following a the transportation system b utility infrastructure c public facilities such as parks and schools d the provision of public safety services and facilities e changes in master plan land use classification designation 2 minor amendment a request for a change that will have a minimal impact on the citys transportation system utility infrastructure and public facilities and the provision of public safety services and facilities a change from one land use category to another may be considered minor if the impact of the requested change is determined to be minimal d adjustment master plans are a generalized guide for land use drainage transportation and public facilities when the more detailed plans for development of the various portions of the master plan are developed there may be a need to make minor adjustments to the master plan the manager may approve adjustments to a master plan to maintain consistency between the master plan and the more detailed plans these adjustments can be approved when they are reviewed in conjunction with a rezoning concept plan andor a development plan examples include minor adjustments to a road alignment to street intersections and to parcel configurations the landowner shall submit a written letter to the manager stating the reason for requesting the adjustments and why the requested adjustments are minor upon review of the written request the manager may approve the request if it is found to be minor             application an application for a land use master plan a facility master plan an amendment or an adjustment thereto shall be filed in accord with the requirements contained in part 2 of this article the application shall be reviewed to ensure consistency with the intent purpose and requirements of this part this zoning the comprehensive plan unless waived by the manager a land suitability analysis meeting the content requirements of

detailed land use classifications listed below improve the consistency in the review of master plans and provide a more detailed representation of location and relationships the following land use classifications shall be used when indicating the various proposed land uses within the plan accompanying definitions are located in section  of this part 1 residential land use for planning purposes the primary concern with regard to residential uses is density expressed as the number of dwelling units per gross acre hence residential land use categories are defined by density ranges these density ranges were established after considering the density distinctions of the park and school fee an analysis of the frequency of all the density ranges in existing master plans and conformity with residential zone districts master plans may specify more incremental density ranges as long as they fit within the categories listed below for example a range of 2  299 is acceptable however a category of 2  4 would not be allowed as a density range because it cuts across the limits of the established categories 0  199 dwelling units per gross acre 2  349 dwelling units per gross acre 35  799 dwelling units per gross acre 8  1199 dwelling units per gross acre 12  2499 dwelling units per gross acre 25+ dwelling units per gross acre 2 commercial land use office and commercial uses are found throughout the city both in individual structures clustered in mixed use centers or in unified developments office uses differ from other commercial categories in their traffic generation characteristics offices generate the bulk of their automobile traffic during peak or rush hours monday other commercial uses rely more heavily on the flow of customers throughout their hours of operation which typically include evenings and weekends these commercial designations conform to generally accepted standards for retail market areas a office b neighborhood commercial c community commercial d regional commercial e highway oriented commercial 3 industrial use industrial uses are those involved with manufacturing processing refining wholesaling testing storage transportation communications and utilities common characteristics of industrial uses include relatively light traffic generation with trucks disproportionately represented  sites with large land areas relative to the number of employees  and horizontally oriented structures a industrial b warehousewholesale c officeindustrial parkresearch and development 4 park and recreational uses this category includes open space trails golf and park uses ownership can be public or private although the majority are publicly owned and maintained with some exceptions traffic volumes generated by these uses will be low relative to the land area higher volumes will be present at sites that serve as major tourist destinations such as garden of the gods park and at some facilities during sporting events traffic is mostly off peak during evenings and weekends although more even flows will be present during summer months recreational facilities must be completely located outdoors to be included in this category skating rinks indoor swimming pools and bowling alleys should be considered commercial uses except for those facilities associated with community or regional parks also excluded from this category are intensive outdoor recreational uses such as racetracks water slides miniature golf courses and other uses that rely on commercial signage and exhibit commercial traffic patterns  sterling codifiers inc  490886 a open space b trail c golf course d neighborhood park e community park f regional park 5 extractive use the primary categories in this classification are mining and agriculture agriculture includes silviculture orchards pasturing grazing confined livestock feeding operations groves and vineyards mining is used here in the broad sense to include the extraction of naturally occurring minerals whether in a solid liquid or gas form accessory agricultural or mining structures fall into this classification as long as their use is directly associated with the extractive activity uses that involve the further processing of resources such as sawmills lumberyards creameries or mineral processing facilities should be classified as industrial a agriculture b mining 6 streetutility rightsofway a rightofway is a strip of land set aside for use as a street crosswalk railroad electric transmissiondistribution line oil or gas pipeline water main sanitary or storm sewer main telephone line or other similar public uses in some cases the right to use land for one of these purposes is obtained easement an easement is created when the landowner turns over some property rights without relinquishing ownership a facility is a piece of land and the improvements that provide for a specific utility transportation or stormwater management use for planning purposes the most significant rightsofway are those set aside for use as major streets arterials and collectors drainage areas and utility lines a arterial street rightofway b collector street rightofway c other public street rightofway d private street rightofway e utility easementrightofway or facility f drainage detention facilities drainageways easements and rightsofway 7 publicinstitutional use public and institutional uses are fairly narrowly defined activities that do not fit into any other classification the majority of these uses are focused on community services but this is not a defining characteristic common features include erratic traffic generation and operating hours a universityconference center b primarysecondary school c hospitallong term care d public safety e minor public assembly f major public assembly g airportmilitary installation h utility facilities 8 activity center activity center is a general term for a mixed use center that integrates a range of complementary and mutually supporting uses and activities typically an activity center includes a predominant type of use such as commercial or employment related that is then supported by a mix of one or more other uses such as residential civic or institutional the predominant use generally determines the type of center activity centers may vary in size intensity scale and their mix of supportive uses depending on their purpose location and context in each case activity centers are intended to be mixed use and pedestrian oriented and to establish good connections and transitions to surrounding areas residences are a component of all activity centers the activity center should support a range of housing affordability types and densities within the individual neighborhoods                   review procedures a an application for a land use master plan a facilities master plan or a major amendment shall be reviewed by the planning commission at a public hearing in accord with part 9 of this article a recommendation by the planning commission shall be forwarded to the city council which may refer the application back to the planning commission for further consideration affirm or

in this section d an application for a minor amendment or adjustment shall be reviewed administratively         review criteria master plans and major and minor amendments to approved master plans shall be reviewed for substantial conformance with the criteria listed below minor amendments are not subject to review criteria in subsection f of this section a comprehensive plan the comprehensive plan is the context and benchmark for the assessment of individual land use master plans the proposed land use master plan or the amendment conforms to the policies and strategies of the comprehensive plan b land use relationships 1 the master plan promotes a development pattern characterizing a mix of mutually supportive and integrated residential and nonresidential land uses with a network of interconnected streets and good pedestrian and bicycle connections 2 activity centers are designed so they are compatible with accessible from and serve as a benefit to the surrounding neighborhood or business area activity centers also vary in size intensity scale and types of uses depending on their function location and surroundings 3 the land use pattern is compatible with existing and proposed adjacent land uses and protects residential neighborhoods from excessive noise and traffic infiltration 4 housing types are distributed so as to provide a choice of densities types and affordability 5 land use types and location reflect the findings of the environmental analysis pertaining to physical characteristics which may preclude or limit development opportunities 6 land uses are buffered where needed by open space andor transitions in land use intensity 7 land uses conform to the definitions contained in section  of this part c public facilities 1 the land use master plan conforms to the most recently adopted colorado springs parks recreation and trails master plan 2 recreational and educational uses are sited and sized to conveniently service the proposed population of the master plan area and the larger community 3 the proposed school sites meet the location function and size needs of the school district 4 the land use master plan conforms to the adopted plans and policies of colorado springs utilities 5 proposed public facilities are consistent with the strategic network of long range plans 6 the master development drainage plan conforms to the applicable drainage basin planning study and the drainage criteria manual d transportation 1 the land use master plan is consistent with the adopted intermodal transportation plan conformity with the intermodal transportation plan is evidence of compliance with state and local air quality implementation and maintenance plans 2 the land use master plan has a logical hierarchy of arterial and collector streets with an emphasis on the reduction of in residential neighborhoods and improves connectivity mobility choices and access to jobs shopping and recreation 3 the design of the streets and multiuse trails minimizes the number of uncontrolled or at grade trail crossings of arterials and collectors 4 the transportation system is compatible with transit routes and allows for the extension of these routes 5 the land use master plan provides opportunities or alternate transportation modes and cost effective provision of transit services to residents and businesses 6 anticipated trip generation does not exceed the capacity of existing or proposed major roads if capacity is expected to be exceeded necessary improvements will be identified as will responsibility if any of the master plan for the construction and timing for its share of improvements e environment 1 the land use master plan preserves significant natural site features and view corridors the colorado springs open space plan shall be consulted in identifying these features 2 the land use master plan minimizes noise impacts on existing and proposed adjacent areas 3 the land use master plan utilizes floodplains and drainageways as greenways for multiple uses including conveyance of runoff wetlands habitat trails recreational uses utilities and access roads when feasible  sterling codifiers inc  492886 4 the land use master plan reflects the findings of a preliminary geologic hazard study and provides a range of mitigation techniques for the identified geologic soil and other constrained natural hazard areas f fiscal 1 a fiscal impact analysis and existing infrastructure capacity and service levels are used as a basis for determining impacts attributable to the master plan city costs related to infrastructure and service levels shall be determined for a ten 10 year time horizon for only the appropriate municipal funds 2 the fiscal impact analysis demonstrates no adverse impact upon the general community and the phasing of the master plan is consistent with the adopted strategic network of long range plans that identify the infrastructure and service needs for public works parks police and fire services 3 the cost of on site and off site master plan impacts on public facilities and services is not borne by the general community in those situations where the master plan impacts are shown to exceed the capacity of existing public facilities and services the applicant will demonstrate a means of increasing the capacity of the public facilities and services proportionate to the impact generated by the proposed master plan mitigation of on site and off site costs may include but is not limited to planned expansions to the facilities amendments to the master plan phasing of the master plan andor special agreements related to construction andor maintenance of infrastructure upgrades andor service expansions any special agreements for mitigation of on site and off site impacts for public improvements services and maintenance are shown to be workable and supported by financial assurances preexisting andor anticipated capacity problems not attributable to the master plan shall be identified as part of the master plan review 4 special agreements for public improvements and maintenance are shown to be workable and are based on proportional need generated by the master plan 5 any proposed special districts are consistent with policies established by the city council                 changed conditions the land use master plan spans the gap between the comprehensive plan and the more site specific zoning concept plans development plans and subdivision plats it is important that these land use master plans remain current and valid as a component of long range land use and infrastructure planning for the city it is recognized that conditions change over time and that the land use master plans shall be reevaluated as part of the annual reporting and monitoring of the citys comprehensive plan to maintain their validity and usefulness to the community during the review of an amendment or minor adjustment the significance of the changed conditions will be evaluated using the following guidelines a changes to the city codes and policies relating to land development or the provision of utility service b new or amended citywide system plans or facility master plans c recommendations from the regional transportation plan including but not limited to 1 carrying capacity of streets 2 changing traffic patterns 3 new major arterials or expressways 4 roadway

standards for the provision of emergency services police and fire based on growth in the vicinity of the master plan g changes in the service standards for parks or schools h an assessment of how development activity such as changes in residential densities and land use types and their cumulative impacts between the time of a master plans original or most recent approval and the present time affects the master plan and infrastructure capacity and provision of urban services in that part of the city           master plan land use definitions a agriculture includes silviculture pasturing grazing confined livestock feeding operations orchards groves and vineyards b airportmilitary installation this category includes only airports or military installations within the city boundaries  sterling codifiers inc  493886 c community commercial community commercial areas differ from neighborhood commercial clusters mainly in scale and variety although the same basic stores and services are present in each community uses tend to have a wider service radius generally over two 2 miles or a population of at least thirty thousand 30000 and may provide opportunities for comparative shopping community centers may cover up to thirty 30 acres and tend to be located at the intersection of major andor minor arterials community commercial centers share the same traffic generation and operational characteristics as neighborhood centers although traffic volumes will be higher at community centers d community park community parks range in size from twenty five 25 to one hundred 100 acres and serve residents within a one and onehalf 112 mile radius typical facilities include those found in neighborhood parks plus softballbaseball diamonds soccer fields swimming pools tennis courts restrooms and parking areas e general industrial uses in this classification are establishments engaged in processing manufacturing assembly utilities or outdoor storage traffic generation will occur chiefly during employee shift changes truck traffic is disproportionately represented operating hours may be nonstandard with many facilities active twenty four 24 hours a day structures tend to be one story and are usually large relative to the number of personnel possible nuisances associated with industrial uses include noise truck traffic and odors typical uses include any permanent outdoor storage area including salvage yards lumberyards and vehicle maintenance areas  factories processing plants refineries mills slaughtering houses and creameries  and nonoffice utility facilities such as water or sewerage treatment plants electrical generation plants and electrical substations f golf course this category includes only standard golf courses miniature golf sites and stand alone driving ranges should be considered commercial uses driving ranges that are part of a golf facility may be included in this classification clubhouses restaurants pro shops and other associated uses are considered accessory to the main use the golf course g highway oriented commercial this category includes nonoffice uses that are dependent on roadway or airport traffic unlike other commercial uses those in this category do not have a geographically defined service area they are oriented toward serving motorists along major roads and highways or airport customers typical uses include hotels motels gas stations and restaurants operating hours include evenings and weekends and traffic generation is steady h hospital an institution providing primary health services and medical or surgical care to persons suffering from illness disease injury and other ailments and including as an integral part of the institution related facilities such as laboratories outpatient facilities or training facilities i major public assembly these uses are structures with capacities of over five hundred 500 people that are only used for scheduled activities specific uses may include places of worship arenas stadiums playhouses and concert venues j mining mining is used here in the broad sense to include the extraction of naturally occurring minerals whether in a solid liquid or gaseous form k minor public assembly minor public assembly sites are structures with capacities of up to five hundred 500 people that are only used for scheduled activities specific uses may include churches synagogues other places of worship playhouses and fraternal lodges traffic generation is concentrated around the event schedule l neighborhood commercial neighborhood commercial uses provide personal and professional services and retail goods for residents within a one and onehalf 112 to two 2 mile radius or a neighborhood of at least five thousand 5000 centers are typically sited at the intersection of a minor arterial andor collector street traffic generation is steady throughout the hours of operation and is characterized by high turnover hours of operation particularly for retail uses may be nonstandard sites for neighborhood commercial centers generally do not exceed ten 10 acres examples of this land use type include convenience stores grocery stores branch banks branch post offices dry cleaners video stores travel agencies and small medical offices m neighborhood park this is the smallest park type with a size range from 35 to twenty five 25 acres the service radius is onehalf 12 mile facilities and improvements typically found in neighborhood parks include playground equipment basketball courts landscaping picnic areas and informal fields n office  industrial parkresearch and development this category includes structures that are used for a combination of industrial office and research and development activities developments often encompass several related buildings in a campus setting traffic generation may be higher than that for general industrial uses but will center around employee travel truck traffic is disproportionately represented but is typically lower than in general industrial uses o office  low medium and high office uses include any structure used primarily for administrative purposes and professional services where the bulk of traffic generation occurs during peak hours truck traffic is limited to occasional deliveries structures housing service providers such as banks or medical facilities that generate constant traffic during standard business hours should be considered commercial rather than office uses office structures may stand alone or be part of a unified development the three 3 office categories here are differentiated by intensity as reflected in floor area ratio far the floor area ratio is the gross building floor area divided by the total site area in square feet the far ranges for each office category are as follows office category floor area ratio far low less than 025  sterling codifiers inc  494886 medium 025 to 044 high 045 or higher p open space an open space area is land that is kept in its natural state in perpetuity vacant land that may be subject to future development is not considered open space there is no specified size range for open space other than the minimum area needed to conserve a significant natural feature q planning evaluation zones planning evaluation zones are contiguous sections of the city with relatively consistent development characteristics planning evaluation zones create manageable planning units for land use transportation facility demographic and growth analysis these planning units are used to provide a context for the evaluation of development proposals such as master plans r primarysecondary school this category is designed for any kindergarten primary or secondary school without boarding students both public and private schools are included s public safety this category includes police and fire stations only t regional commercial these are primarily retail land uses intended to provide some of the functions of the other commercial centers plus the sale of general merchandise and may include some office uses sites generally exceed thirty 30 acres and tend to be located at the intersection of two 2 major arterials the service area is a radius of about five 5 miles or at least one hundred thousand 100000 people hours of operation include evenings and weekends traffic generation is constant and volumes are high relative to other commercial types u regional park regional parks are at least one hundred 100 acres in size and serve a population within one hours drive all of the existing regional parks in colorado springs contain mostly natural areas with few developed facilities however the parks and recreation guidelines permit all of the uses found in neighborhood and community parks with the addition of visitor centers information centers golf courses boating and fishing v residential this category includes uses providing primarily permanent living accommodations they include detached and attached singlefamily twofamily multifamily dwelling units as well as accessory dwelling units apartments townhomes condominiums mobile homes manufactured homes boarding homes and retirement homes w trail trails are linear spaces dedicated to nonmotorized users such as pedestrians bicyclists and equestrians limited motorized uses may be allowed for maintenance or security trails may be located within parks or open spaces or by themselves x universityconference center this category includes colleges universities boarding schools and resorts or conference centers with residential components common characteristics are campus setting with multiple buildings such as temporary living quarters offices classrooms meeting rooms recreation areas and dining facilities  typically extensive grounds  the provision of living quarters is secondary to the primary activity education conferences rehabilitation etc  periodic guest or student turnover  nonstandard operating hours  and erratic traffic generation establishments that are primarily engaged in providing lodging such as hotels and motels are not included y warehousewholesale uses in this category share many of the physical characteristics of general industrial uses but are engaged only in storage and wholesaling only very limited outdoor storage is allowed  indoor storage is the standard for this category the most common uses include warehouses rental storage units and wholesale trade establishments structures are large relative to the number of employees and the majority of traffic generation is from employees some wholesale establishments may draw significant customer traffic but not as much as would be expected from a similarly sized commercial business truck traffic is disproportionately high    part 5 concept plans and development plans  concept plans a description and purpose each zone district is primarily intended for a predominant type of land use or mix of land uses with specific physical requirements which regulate structure size and placement on the site a concept plan is used to review the impact of the proposed land uses on the adjacent properties neighborhood road systems and existing and planned infrastructure and to determine the need for additional dedication and design criteria it is intended to be a general outline of a proposed zone district or project which shows access primary circulation areas to be used for buildings parking landscaping and buffering and areas which should be preserved or protected the purposes of the concept plan review are 1 to ensure use to use compatibility between the proposed land uses zone district with the surrounding area  2 to minimize potential hazardous adverse or objectionable effects of the proposal  3 to ensure safe points of access to all future lots and adjacent properties  4 to ensure when used as or in conjunction with a preliminary plat that all subdivision requirements such as right of way width and utility easement dedications can be met  5 to ensure that all zone district development standards can be met  6 to establish ranges of uses and square footages and other conditions of record for future development   sterling codifiers inc  495886 7 to evaluate existing and proposed road systems utilities schools parks and other public facilities to determine if they are adequate to serve the

remaining areas of the concept plan shall remain approved and valid e concept plan review criteria a concept plan shall be reviewed using the criteria listed below no concept plan shall be approved unless the plan complies with all the requirements of the zone district in which it is located is consistent with the intent and purpose of this zoning is compatible with the existing and proposed land uses surrounding the site 1 will the proposed development have a detrimental effect upon the general health welfare and safety or convenience of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the proposed development 2 will the proposed density types of land uses and range of square footages permit adequate light and air both on and off the site 3 are the permitted uses bulk requirements and required landscaping appropriate to the type of development the neighborhood and the community 4 are the proposed ingressegress points traffic circulation parking areas loading and service areas and pedestrian areas designed to promote safety convenience and ease of traffic flow and pedestrian movement both on and off the site 5 will the proposed development overburden the capacities of existing streets utilities parks schools and other public facilities 6 does the proposed development promote the stabilization and preservation of the existing properties in adjacent areas and surrounding residential neighborhoods 7 does the concept plan show how any potentially detrimental use to use relationships eg commercial use adjacent to singlefamily homes will be mitigated does the development provide a gradual transition between uses of differing intensities 8 is the proposed concept plan in conformance with all requirements of this zoning the subdivision with all applicable elements of the comprehensive plan           development plans a description and purpose each zoning district is primarily intended for a predominant type of land use or mix of land uses with specific minimum and maximum development standards which regulate the structure height bulk and placement on the site and the amount and location of landscaping and buffer between uses all combinations of permitted uses and development standards in a zoning district may not be appropriate at a particular location it is necessary to require a development plan in order to review the specific impacts of the proposed land use and site design on the adjacent properties neighborhood schools parks road systems and existing and planned infrastructure the proposed site design can be evaluated against all the circumstances weighing upon this individual case the purposes of the development plan review are 1 to ensure use to use compatibility between the proposed land use and site design with the surrounding area 2 to minimize objectionable and adverse effects and to eliminate potential hazards of the proposed land use by proposing specific site design solutions 3 to ensure points of access internal circulation and pedestrian movement to all proposed lots land uses and adjacent properties  sterling codifiers inc  496886 4 to ensure that all zone district development standards are met 5 to ensure when used in conjunction with a preliminary or final subdivision plat that all subdivision requirements including but not limited to easement and public facility dedication requirements can be met 6 to establish the approval of specified uses square footages site design and other conditions  and 7 to evaluate existing and proposed road systems utilities schools parks and other public facilities to determine if they are adequate to serve the proposed project this review may indicate the most appropriate land use development is one which is less intensive than the maximum allowed by the zone and that the most appropriate site design is one which requires greater than minimum standards b development plan required a development plan shall be required prior to the issuance of a

property values it is the intent of these regulations to allow sexually oriented businesses to exist within the city in various dispersed locations along the lines of the city of detroit model rather

policies city charter section 670 requires that extension policies for the services provided by the utilities be established by the city council b water wastewater service outside city limits city council believes that definite statements need to be made in order to establish a policy pertaining to the provision and extension of water or wastewater or both to consumers outside the city limits who own or occupy land not presently eligible for annexation  sterling codifiers inc  534886 c policy statements 1 the citizens of the city are the owners of water provided to themselves and to consumers outside the city limits the monies collected from development charges and the revenues generated by sale of water and processing of wastewater are necessary to pay for the acquisition and development of the water and the construction operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater facilities 2 the city must consider the future water and wastewater needs of areas outside the corporate limits if the pikes peak urban area is to continue to grow to accommodate anticipated population however in considering the future water and wastewater needs of areas outside the city consideration must be given to the capacity to serve within the corporate limits of the city 3 the extension or provision of water or wastewater or both is a method of fostering compatible land use and development inside and outside the city limits and should be handled in a manner which will ensure sound land use relationships and promote orderly development 4 persons inside the city limits who receive water or wastewater services must comply with city ordinances including but not limited to construction fire protection subdivision zoning and health codes such persons must pay ad valorem taxes upon their real property it seems only reasonable then that persons outside the city limits who desire water or wastewater services should be required to do no less than those who receive such services inside the city as well as pay additional fees for such services 5 there is a need to sell water and process wastewater for revenues to meet the costs of owning and operating the citys water and wastewater system and the need to ensure that land use and development outside of the corporate limits of the city is compatible with land use within the city and will not have an adverse impact on the city and its facilities public and private 6 there is no obligation imposed by general law upon the city to permit any of the citys water to be used outside its boundaries neither is there an obligation under general law to reserve water for undeveloped land presently within the citys boundaries     comply with state laws annexation consolidation or disconnection of territory to or from

projected available water surplus at the time of request  d the existing and projected water facilities andor wastewater facilities of the city are expected to be sufficient for the present and projected needs for the foreseeable future to serve all present users whether within or outside the corporate limits of the city  e the annexation can be effected at the time the utilities are extended or at some time in the future  f the city shall require as a condition of annexation the transfer of title to all groundwater underlying the land proposed to be annexed should such groundwater be separated from the land or otherwise be unavailable for transfer to the city the city at its discretion may either refuse annexation or require payment commensurate with the value of such groundwater as a condition of annexation the value of such groundwater shall be determined by the utilities based on market conditions as presently exist  g all rights of way or easements

within the city limits as such city limits exist at the time of adoption of this section or as such city limits may be hereinafter altered by annexation or disconnection any right to the preservation of existing water rights or quantities of water for the sole and exclusive use of such land c in the interest of the citizens of the city city council will not extend water or wastewater service into any area which is not presently included within the utilities electric service area an exception to this policy may be made if the area requesting service can be annexed to the city at the time of

council 1 would cause unnecessary delay to the annexor in commencing work on the proposed development  or 2 would impose an unnecessary economic hardship upon the annexor without any compensating advantage or benefit to the city or its citizens in any event the city council hereby declares that its discretion in determining the existence or nonexistence of good cause is a legislative act and is not subject to judicial review  sterling codifiers inc  536886 b a petition for annexation subject to such conditions as city council in its discretion may impose must be first filed before a permit or permits for such water or wastewater service shall be issued or any work commence to extend such water or wastewater service beyond the city limits existing at that time once filed such

developer or redeveloper of land hereafter collectively referred to as a developer the developer is entitled to fair share reimbursement of the cost of the improvements less any city reimbursement from the owner or owners whose property is subdivided developed or redeveloped within twenty five 25 years after acceptance of the improvements by the city the date of acceptance of the improvement will be the date of final inspection by city engineering however if a developer has not requested such a final inspection by the city within thirty 30 months after completion of the improvements there will be no recovery right for the improvement involved 3 processing cost recovery agreements a developer wishing to avail itself of the provisions of this section shall file a cost recovery statement with city engineering not later than twelve 12 months after the date the improvement was accepted such statement shall be accompanied by copies of paid receipts or other satisfactory evidence of payment of the costs claimed for the improvement city engineering will then review the cost recovery statement for reasonableness and appropriateness of the costs claimed and may request backup for any such costs city engineering may make such adjustments as it determines are necessary if the costs are in excess of reasonable and necessary costs at then prevailing rates if city engineering does not notify the party submitting the cost recovery statement in writing of any adjustments to the costs listed in the statement within thirty 30 days after the statement was submitted or if backup documentation is requested within 30 days within 30 days after the requested backup documentation is submitted then the costs in the statement will be deemed approved as submitted the developer will be responsible for notifying all property owners who will be affected by the cost recovery agreement by certified mail that a cost recovery statement which may affect their property has been submitted to city engineering city engineering will assist the developer in determining the property owners to be notified and in obtaining the names and addresses of such properties when the costs subject to reimbursement have been approved as provided above and city engineering has been provided proof that the certified mail notices have been sent to affected property owners the city and the developer shall then execute a cost recovery agreement on the standard form approved by the city the cost recovery agreement after execution the cost recovery agreement shall be recorded with the el paso county clerk and recorder by city engineering the developer will pay all costs of recording 4 repayment of costs during the cost recovery period an application for a plat or building permit from owners whose property abuts the improvements shall not be approved until a fair share reimbursement for the cost of the improvements has been made to the original developer city engineering will not approve any such plat if it leaves unplatted strips along the roadway subject to reimbursement fails to plat portions of such owners property which are reasonably necessary for effective utilization of the property being platted or is otherwise configured so as to avoid the reasonable fair share payment by such owner under this article all liability for improvement costs shall be limited to twenty five 25 years after acceptance of the improvements by the city a signed notarized copy by the original developer and subsequent developer for the release of the cost recovery agreement shall be submitted to city engineering and shall state that payment has been made in full and that all parties agree to the release of the cost recovery agreement from the property involved the release shall be recorded with the el paso county clerk and recorder by city engineering the cost of recording shall be charged to the owner of the property being released during the cost recovery period approval of plats or building permits for the land abutting the improvements shall be conditioned upon payment of the fair share of the improvement cost as determined by city engineering if city engineering determines that such improvements would have been required to be installed by the subsequent developer all liability for improvement costs shall be limited to a period of twenty five 25 years after acceptance of the improvements by the city city engineering shall determine the fair share reimbursements on a front foot basis on january 1 of the year following acceptance of the  sterling codifiers inc  559886 improvements by the city and each year thereafter on january 1 the reimbursement amount shall be increased by ten percent 10% simple interest 5 address for payments unclaimed payments it is the responsibility of the developer to notify city engineering in writing of any changes in address for notices and payments under this article if city engineering mails a notice of reimbursement specifying the amount of reimbursement and the property involved a reimbursement notice to the developer by certified mail using such developers most recent address in city engineerings files and no response is received within thirty 30 days then city engineering shall be authorized to execute on behalf of such developer and record a release of the cost recovery agreement from the property paying the reimbursement if the reimbursement involved is not claimed by the developer within twelve 12 months following mailing of the reimbursement notice then the reimbursement involved will be paid to the citys general fund and the developer will forfeit all rights to it 6 extension of recovery period the city recognizes that requiring a developer to make improvements as described in subsection c1 of this section imposes on such party additional costs for improvements which benefit the adjacent property owners it is the citys policy to provide the developer a reasonable opportunity to recover the fair share of such costs from the property benefited and not to allow the property being benefited an unfair windfall by merely delaying development until expiration of the recovery period the city had initially set a fifteen 15 year recovery period but experience has now shown a significant number of existing recovery agreements will soon expire without the developer being able to recover a fair share of the additional costs they were required to expend on improvements for the benefit of adjacent lands thus in order to assure the citys policy of requiring all properties to pay their fair share of improvements the city hereby extends the recovery period on all existing cost recovery agreements to twenty five 25 years after the date the improvements involved were accepted by the city 7 improvements already in place if the improvements are already in place and if city engineering determines that such improvements would have been required to be installed by any developer abutting the improvements as a condition of development the developer may be required as a condition of approval of development to pay to the city a fair share as determined on a front foot basis of the original costs of the improvements subject to ten percent 10% simple interest factor each year and subject to the twenty five 25 year limitation if no cost recovery agreement is in effect or a cost recovery agreement is invalid for any reason 8 existing agreements the provisions of this article shall apply to all cost recovery agreements in effect on  and thereafter city engineering is authorized to record any cost recovery agreements not previously recorded with the el paso county clerk and recorder city engineering is also authorized to cooperate with developers who have existing cost recovery agreements on file to implement a system for indexing such agreements and notifying affected property owners of such agreements d cost recovery by the city and other governmental entities nothing in this section is intended to preclude or prohibit the city or another governmental entity from entering into and being a party to cost recovery agreements with landowners for public roadway improvements in these types of cost recovery agreements interest may not be charged on the costs of the installed or constructed public roadway improvements             reimbursements a costs subject to reimbursement 1 as to a rightofway for a major street the fair market value of that portion of the rightofway in excess of sixty feet 60 in width shall be a cost subject to reimbursement
