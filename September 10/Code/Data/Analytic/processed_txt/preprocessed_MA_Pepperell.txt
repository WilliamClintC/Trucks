preface to the original edition located on the beautiful northern regions of massachusetts the town of pepperell has passed struggles that characterize all american communities in their early history while only a few simple laws were necessary at the time of the incorporation of the town subsequent growth of the community together with the complexity of modern life has created the need for more and detailed laws for the proper function and government of the town the recording of local law is an aspect of municipal history and as the community develops and changes review and revision of old laws and consideration of new laws in the light of current trends must keep pace the orderly collection of these records is an important step in this ever continuing process legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records they must be available and logically arranged for convenient use and must be kept uptodate it was with thoughts such as these in mind that the following codification of bylaws and rules and regulations was ordered contents of the bylaws adopted by the town meeting as well as the rules and regulations adopted by the board of selectmen and the planning board also contained in the rules and regulations adopted by other boards or persons authorized to do so by statute or town law division of divided into three major parts known as divisions division 1 contains the bylaws adopted by the town meeting this division is further broken down into parts i and ii administrative legislation contains all bylaws of an administrative nature namely those dealing with the administration of government those establishing or regulating municipal departments and those affecting officers and employees general legislation contains all bylaws of a regulatory nature bylaws in this part generally impose penalties for violation of their provisions whereas those in do not division 2 contains the regulations promulgated by the board of selectmen division 3 contains other miscellaneous regulations such as those adopted by the planning board grouping of legislation and arrangement of chapters the bylaws and other rules and regulations are organized into chapters their order being an alphabetical progression from one subject to another wherever there are two or more ordinances dealing with the same subject they are combined into a single chapter thus for example all bylaws dealing with sewers may be found in the chapter entitled sewers in such chapters use of has preserved the identity of the individual items of legislation table of contents the table of contents details the arrangement of material by chapter as a means of identifying specific areas of legislation wherever two or more bylaws or rules and regulations have been combined by the editors into a single chapter titles of the several articles are listed beneath the chapter title in order to facilitate location of the individual enactments reserved chapters 101 space has been provided in each division of the the convenient insertion alphabetically of later enactments in the table of contents such space appears as chapters titled reserved in the body of the reserved space is provided by breaks in the pagenumbering sequence between chapters pagination a unique pagenumbering system has been used in which each chapter forms an autonomous unit one hundred pages have been allotted to each chapter and the first page of each is the number of that chapter followed by the numerals  thus begins on  on  etc by use of this system it is possible to add or to change pages in any chapter without affecting the sequence of subsequent pages in other chapters and to insert new chapters without affecting the existing organization numbering of chapterrelated sectionnumbering system is employed in which each section of every ordinance is assigned a number which indicates both the number of the chapter in which the legislation is located and the location of the section within the chapter thus the first section of is  161 while the sixth section of is  2006 scheme the scheme is the list of section titles which precedes the text of each chapter these titles are carefully written so that taken together they may be considered as a summary of the content of the chapter taken separately each describes the content of a particular section for ease and precision of reference the scheme titles are repeated as section headings in the text at the end of the scheme in each chapter is located the legislative history for that chapter this history indicates the specific legislative source from which the chapter was derived and date of adoption in the case of chapters containing articles derived from more than one item of legislation the source of each indicated in the history general references in each chapter containing material related to other chapters in the a table of general references is included to direct the readers attention to such related chapters 102 appendix certain forms of local legislation do not fall into the categories established for divisions 1 of the are of such significance that their application is communitywide or their provisions are germane to the conduct of municipal government the appendix of this reserved for such legislation and for any other material that the municipality may wish to include index the index is a guide to information since it is likely that this be used by persons without formal legal training the index has been formulated to enable such persons to locate a particular section quickly each section of each chapter has been indexed the index should be supplemented and revised from time to time as new legislation is added to the supplementation of the follow the adoption of new legislation new ordinances and amendments will be included and repeals will be indicated as soon as possible after passage statutory references references to the

which also revises the vacation leave accumulation limit and if that employee had accumulated more leave than the new limit allows the following rule will apply under no circumstances may an employee lose earned accumulated vacation leave due to a revised work schedule at the employees discretion and with the concurrence of the department head accrued vacation leave in excess of the new maximum may be paid out as though the employee still had a longer work schedule not to exceed the earlier longer schedule so the employee may receive a maximum of regular pay for vacation leave as under the prior work schedule vacation leave taken in lieu of hours worked will be deducted from the new lower accumulation limit to allow for normal accumulation if vacation leave over and above the new scheduled work hours is taken it will come from the excess accrued vacation and will result in additional pay but not additional time off work under no circumstances may vacation leave be paid out for hours not worked if such payments would result in an overtime payment example a 40 hour per week employee with 720 hours of accrued vacation leave has hisher scheduled work hours revised to 20 hours per week with a corresponding reduction of allowable vacation accrual to 360 hours the employee now has an excess of 360 hours over the limit normally allowed for an employee with a 20 hour per week schedule if that employee works 10 hours and takes 10 hours vacation time during the next week heshe is paid for 20 hours total and has reduced hisher vacation below the 360 hour limit by 10 hours at the end of that month up to 10 hours of vacation depending on the length of service with the town may be accrued bringing the total vacation balance back to no more than 360 hours during the week in this example up to 20 excess vacation hours may also be paid out to the employees so that the employee does not receive more than 40 hours per week of regular pay and vacation leave combined if

features on abutting properties if any  evaluating site context the second step is to evaluate the site in its larger context by identifying natural eg streams wetlands steep slopes transportation eg roads woods roads trails and cultural eg historic and recreational sites connections to surrounding land uses and activities  designating the contiguous open space the third step is to identify the contiguous open space to be preserved on the site such open space should include the most sensitive and noteworthy resources on the site and where appropriate areas that serve to extend existing networks of open space or land protected under easements  location of building sites and development areas the fourth step is to locate building sites parking areas paths and other features of the
