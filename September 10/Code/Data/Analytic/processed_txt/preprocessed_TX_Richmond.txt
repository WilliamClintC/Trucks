postconstruction stormwater runoff general provisions a findings of fact it is hereby determined that 1 land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites 2 therefore the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation it is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety b purpose the purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction this article seeks to meet that purpose following objectives 1 minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding siltation increases in stream temperature and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels  2 minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality  3 minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the predevelopment hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable  4 reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution wherever possible management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety c applicability 1 this article shall be applicable to all

development city of richmond tx | unified development a best management practices the city requires best management practices bmps for any activity operation or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water the storm drain system or waters of the united states 1 structural and nonstructural bmps structural and nonstructural bmps shall require the following a that a commercial or industrial establishments owner or operator shall provide at their own expense reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes in the municipal storm drain system or watercourses b that any person responsible for a property or premise which is or may be the source of an illicit discharge is required to implement at said persons expense additional structural and nonstructural bmps to prevent further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system 2 npdes permit a authorization the provisions of this be deemed compliant once all terms and conditions of a valid npdes permit is authorized the npdes permit shall be authorized to discharge storm water associated with industrial activity to the greatest extend possible b stormwater pollution prevention plan swpp best management practices shall be part of a swpp as necessary for compliance with requirements of the npdes permit 3 postconstruction storm water bmps postconstruction permanent storm water bmps are generally divided into two categories treatment bmps and source control bmps a treatment bmps postconstruction treatment bmps include a variety of alternatives generally categorized as conveyance practices and storage practices eg a grass swale retention pond or sand filter that provide treatment of the storm water runoff quantity and quality b source control bmps proactively controlling pollutants at their source is fundamental to effective storm water quality typically it is easier and more costeffective to prevent storm water pollution than to remove contaminants once they have entered the storm sewer system or receiving water a good source control bmp is one that is effective at stopping andor redirecting pollutants prior to entering the storm sewer system a source control bmp can be a structural component of a planned site eg a covered area for material storage or a procedural bmp procedural bmps depend on behavior change accomplished education training and development of standard operating procedures b low impact development the following are techniques that can be used to minimize the impact of impervious surfaces by reducing connected impervious surfaces to a minimum thereby reducing the area and cost of mitigation techniques 1 water gardens convey drainage from rooftops or drives to water gardens the water garden shall be landscaped with natural vegetation that includes unmowed groundcovers and woody plants that can tolerate periodic inundation when conveying the roof runoff to open spaces with natural vegetation care must be taken to assure sheet flow not channelized flow to prevent erosion 2 rain barrels or cisterns rain barrels or cisterns can be designed into the buildings or yards so that roof runoff is directed to these storage facilities and used for beneficial purposes such as lawn watering vehicle washing or other nonpotable purposes a variety of commercial products are available for this purpose their installation must be partly assured by the subdividers surety 3 pervious pavements driveway parking areas or sidewalks may be constructed from pervious concrete to provide infiltration of runoff pervious concrete or asphalt is recommended for minor roads or heavily used parking areas concrete or other containment structures that hold gravel or turf are recommended for driveways or low use parking areas city of richmond tx | unified development  vegetated swales these shall be used unless the subdivider can show they are impractical or that the slopes would result in erosion 5 swale blocks the swale block is installed at intervals along a vegetated swale to allow the water to build up into a series of pools slowing water flow and allowing the vegetation to assist in cleaning the water and settling out solids the blocks shall be slotted to allow them to drain down and have a notch to permit maximum flows during the 50year storm without overflowing the swale the use of swale blocks slows flows and decreases pollutant loading and the detention facilities shall be sized to account for the reduction in flows 6 curb and gutter curb and gutter systems and their associated storm sewer system are undesirable because they greatly increase peak discharge rate and prevent infiltration or treatment of storm water curb and gutter systems shall be used only where needed to contain parking when swales cannot safely convey the volume and peak discharge rate of storm water without erosion or where curbs are needed to contain parking on streets when roads transverse open space areas curbs shall be removed streets can be narrowed and parking provided in bays allowing parking to be prohibited this eliminates the need for curbs 7 curbs

certain minimum standards that are consistent with the character and quality of development in richmond which may be quickly approved and displayed for some development alternative standards may contribute to the aesthetic qualities of the development approval of a sign design program pursuant to the standards of this division allows for unified presentation of signage throughout a parcel proposed for development flexibility to provide for unique environments and preapproval of designs and design elements to make subsequent applications for sign permits more efficient to this end a sign design program alternative is created 2 approval criteria the planning and zoning commission may approve a sign design program if it results in a substantially improved comprehensive and unified proposal compared to what is allowed compliance with the sign regulations of this division the shall review all sign types eg attached window etc for the parcel proposed for development to determine the degree of compliance with this division and shall report to the planning and zoning commission with regard to the degree of deviation from these standards that is sought by the applicant the degree of deviation sought by the applicant shall be measured against the degree of compliance with the standards of this division 3 conditions of approval the planning and zoning commission may impose reasonable conditions on the sign design program that are not related to the content of the signs or the viewpoints of the sign users in order to ensure continuing compliance with the standards of this division and approved sign design programs city of richmond tx | unified development b contents of sign design program a sign design program shall set out a master plan for signage for an entire parcel proposed for development for example shopping center sign design programs shall include all tenants and lots  and office or industrial parks shall include all types of signs for wayfinding and tenants or uses within the development sign design programs shall set out 1 sign dimensions and approximate locations  2 materials and colors  3 proposed illumination including illumination levels  4 maximum numbers of items of information per sign face  5 a design theme with illustrative examples of each sign type and the proposed general locations of each sign type  and 6 a demonstration that the sign design program will improve the aesthetics of the development and will not have an adverse impact on the use enjoyment or value of property in adjacent or nearby residential districts or uses c effect of approval upon approval of a sign design program issuance of a sign permit shall be based on compliance with the standards set out in the sign program for the parcel proposed for development a generally signage which is proposed as part of a sign design program may deviate from the standards of this division in terms of the types and numbers of signs allowed the maximum sign area the maximum signable area ratio and materials and illumination standards excluding electronic message centers subject to compliance with a sign design program that is approved according to the criteria set out in this prohibited signs and sign elements prohibited signs and sign elements are not eligible for inclusion in a sign design program unless specifically indicated in this modification of sign setbacks setbacks for freestanding signs may deviate from the requirements of this it is demonstrated that there is no impact on public safety or utility

located within the district f height area number and location of signs 1 the height area number and location of signs permitted sign design program shall be determined by the planning and zoning commission based on the following criteria city of richmond tx | unified development a the overall size of the parcel proposed for development and the scale of the use or uses located or anticipated to be located there larger land areas and scales of use tend to favor larger signs andor more signs  b relationship between the building setback and sign location additional signage may be appropriate for buildings with less visibility particularly where buffering is providing an aesthetic andor environmental benefit to the city  c frontage larger frontages may justify more or larger signs particularly if the size of the frontage tends to prevent sign clutter from multiple adjacent parcels  d access and visibility to the site  e intended traffic circulation pattern and the need for wayfinding  f hierarchy of signage  g relationship between the site and adjacent uses  h the desired function of the site eg an urban center or activity center would tend to include signage that is more urban and more dynamic in character than a strip shopping center  and i consistency with the objectives and design policies of the comprehensive master plan and any applicable subarea plans 2 additionally the maximum permitted sign area shall be based on the following formula when evaluated against the above criteria a the maximum area permitted for attached signage shall range from one percent up to a maximum of six percent of the building faade to which the sign is to be attached b the maximum total permitted area of all freestanding signs on a parcel proposed for development shall not exceed 10 percent more than the total sign area that would otherwise be permitted by nonresidential and mixeduse district signs g community character the signage proposed in a sign design program shall not have an adverse impact on the community character of the district in which the parcel proposed for development is located or of the city h property values the signage proposed in a sign

drainage design within the city limits and the extra territorial jurisdiction of richmond is the prevention of structure flooding and the maintenance of one lane passable in each direction on major thoroughfares during a 100year storm event this is accomplished of various drainage enhancements such as storm sewers roadside ditches open channels detention and overland sheet runoff the combined system is intended to prevent structural flooding from extreme events up to a 100year storm recognizing that each site has unique differences that can enhance the opportunity to provide proper drainage the intent of these criteria is to specify minimum requirements that can be modified provided that the objective for drainage standards is maintained street ponding of short duration is anticipated and designed to contribute to the overall drainage capability of the system storm sewers and roadside ditch conduits are designed as a balance of capacity and economics these conduits are designed to convey less intense more frequent rainfalls with the intent of allowing for traffic movement during these events when rainfall events exceed the capacity of the storm sewer system the

83design requirements a design philosophy large speed differentials among motor vehicles traveling the same or connecting roadways creates unsafe driving conditions minimizing speed differentials proper design of driveway approaches promotes driver and pedestrian safety it is the citys policy to require a driveway design that creates no more than a 20 mph maximum speed differential on roadways the goal of the city policy is to create a balance between optimal access and safety generally as the widths of streets and vehicular speeds increase the number of driveway approaches should decrease driveway approaches accessing major thoroughfares should be situated in a manner that minimizes the number of potential conflict points a single piece of property served by multiple driveways may increase speed differentials and is generally considered undesirable for commercial development shared commercial driveways shall be a requirement regulated access removing turning vehicles from the traffic stream and channelization of traffic should be determined on a sitespecific basis taking into consideration the policies and requirements of the city and other regulating entities and

generally the petitioner shall use the peak one hour period which occurs during either 79 am or 46 pm periods or both as agreed to by the staff and petitioner in some cases however the city engineer may require additional hours for example friday nights or saturday afternoon to also be analyzed city of richmond tx | unified development directional split the directional split of the entering and exiting traffic associated with the development will be derived from the ite trip generation manual unless other acceptable locally generated data is available passby trips the percent of passby trips shall be applied to the trips generated by the proposed development and assigned to the adjacent street network this rate does not affect the proposed projects driveway volumes but rather reassigns existing trips to movements entering and existing the proposed development the following passby trip rates have been determined for some land uses land use acceptable trip reduction retail > 400000

diverted trips would be considered new trips within the study area and can be ignored in most cases this factor if applicable will be decided during the preliminary meeting internal circulation trips reductions for internal circulation trips are applicable for projects such as shopping centers with outlots and represents a reduction in projected driveway trips the internal circulation trip rate will be agreed upon during the preliminary meeting and shall not exceed 10 percent trip distribution the directional distribution of the generated trips entering and exiting the proposed development via all access points must be justified by the relative locations of other traffic generators eg employment centers transportation terminals etc andor trip table information these factors or other factors agreed upon by the department of public works shall be applied to the traffic generated by the proposed development as well as the traffic generated by nearby approved projects trip assignment the distribution factors shall be applied to the trips generated by the proposed development and nearby approved projects and assigned to the existing traffic on the road network providing access to the proposed development capacity analysis at the identified critical intersections the existing and generated traffic is to be related to the adequacy of the intersection by using the techniques described in the latest edition of the highway capacity manual or utilizing synchro modeling software the analysis should be carried out for the am andor pm peaks as agreed to by the staff and applicant it is also recommended that the operational methodology be used in the analysis of signalized intersections traffic data a traffic volume data may be available from the department of public works for some locations within the city if however acceptable data is not available the petitioner is responsible for obtaining all required data b traffic count data should be no older than one year or the city may require new counts be collected if in the opinion of the department of public works staff traffic volumes have significantly increased due to some changes city of richmond tx | unified development in the traffic pattern such as the completion of a development project after the count was made new counts may also be required c if turning movement data is outdated or if there are locations for which data is nonexistent data must be acquired at the applicants expense d intersection traffic counts conducted by the petitioner should be comprised of manual turning movement counts covering the peak am and pm periods in order to allow for the selection of the peak hour within the next fifteen minutes eg   etc the inclusion of all am and pm peak period turning movement data is requested as part of the traffic impact analysis e ideally the traffic analysis should be performed for the design hour which represents the 30th highest hourly traffic volume on an annual basis however most peak hour traffic volume counts in urban areas closely approximate the 30th highest hour historical counts and staff knowledge of the area will be used to judge the adequacy of counts used by the applicant f if the proposed development includes plans for the installation of a new traffic control signal the petitioner must conduct a traffic signal warrant analysis this analysis would produce documentation that indicates the conditions at the proposed location warrant a traffic signal by meeting the recommended minimum warrants presented in the manual for uniform traffic control devices mutcd documentation of this analysis should be included in the appendix of the final report and should include but not be limited to the methodology used daily traffic count data used in the analysis and the resulting capacity analysis results at this location adequate accommodation of traffic the ability of a highway system to carry traffic is expressed in terms of volumetocapacity vc ratios and level of service at the critical locations usually intersections the vc ratios clearly define the degree of saturation at an intersection a vc ratio of 10 indicates that the intersection is operating at its theoretical capacity that is the traffic volume demand equals the estimated number of vehicles that may pass intersection in a given period of time a value of over 10 depicts a situation where the demand exceeds the intersections capacity and operational problems exist either in geometrics or signalization as the vc ratio approaches 09 breakdowns in the operational efficiency of the intersection tend to develop when the vc increases above 09 operational breakdowns also increase in frequency and may result in a high level of delay to motorists in considering mitigation measures the change in vc ratio and level of service must be taken into account as well as the actual vc values of individual approaches and the overall intersection if no mitigation exists or if the improvements required are beyond what could reasonably be expected from the applicant then negotiations between the petitioner and the city will be conducted to determine the level of petitioner responsibility for improvements at the intersection levelofservice for signalized intersections is defined by the transportation research boards highway capacity manual in terms of delay generally delay is considered a measure of driver discomfort frustration lost time and fuel consumption delay at signalized intersections is a result of a number of factors including

combination of mainly physical measures that reduce the negative effects of motor vehicle use alter driver behavior and improve conditions for nonmotorized street users 2 urban sprawl and traffic congestion continue to increase in the united states as a result speeds and cutthrough volumes on local streets and collectors will continue to increase unless traffic calming measures are put in place or new local and minor collector roadways are designed with traffic calming in mind 3 the design manual and udc are intended to provide design and access requirements that are proactive in addressing traffic calming issues in residential areas 4 traffic control devices such as stop signs and speed limit signs are regulatory measures that require enforcement traffic calming measures
