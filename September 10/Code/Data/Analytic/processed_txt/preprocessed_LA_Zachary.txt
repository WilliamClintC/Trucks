authority the city council finds that 1 the city has the authority to regulate signs under the united states constitution the constitution of the state of louisiana and the city charter of the city of zachary  2 this important and substantial governmental interests  3 the regulations set out in this unrelated to the suppression of constitutionallyprotected free expression and do not involve the

individuals or the community and speech that is harmful to minors may be prohibited in places that are accessible to minors c general findings of fact the city council finds that 1 the ability to display signs of reasonable size and dimensions is vital to the health and sustainability of many businesses and the display of signs with noncommercial messages is a traditional component of the freedom of speech  2 the city has an important and substantial interest in preventing sign clutter which is the proliferation of signs of increasing size and dimensions as a result of competition among property owners for the attention of passing motorists because sign clutter degrades the character of the community makes the community a less attractive place for commerce and private investment and dilutes all of the messages displayed along the citys streets by creating visual confusion and aesthetic blight  3 sign clutter can be prevented by regulations that balance the legitimate needs of individual property owners to convey their commercial and noncommercial messages against the comparable needs of adjacent and nearby property owners and the interest of the community in providing for a high quality community character  4 temporary signs that are not constructed of weatherresistant materials are often damaged or destroyed by wind rain and sun and after

the city has an important and substantial interest in protecting the health of its tree canopy which contributes to the character and value of the community  and 7 the uncontrolled use of offpremises outdoor advertising signs and their location density size shape motion illumination and demand for attention can be injurious to the purposes of this destructive to community character and property values and that as such restrictions on the display of offpremises commercial messages are necessary and desirable of generally hereinafter all construction relocation enlargement alteration and

minimum standards that are consistent with the expected character and quality of new development in zachary may be quickly approved and displayed for some proposals alternative standards may contribute to the aesthetic qualities of the development approval of a sign design program pursuant to the standards of this division allows for unified presentation of signage throughout a parcel proposed for development flexibility to provide for unique environments and preapproval of designs and design elements to make subsequent applications for sign permits more efficient to this end a sign design program alternative is created 2 approval criteria the planning commission may approve a sign design program if it results in a substantially improved comprehensive and unified proposal

cannot be seen from outside of the parcel proposed for development  2 does not create a sky glow under normal conditions  and 3 does not shine into windows of residential units located within the district f height area number and location of signs 1 the height area number and location of signs permitted sign design program shall be determined by the planning commission based on the following criteria a the overall size of the parcel proposed for development and the scale of the use or uses located or anticipated to be located there larger land areas and scales of use tend to favor larger signs and  or more signs  b relationship between the building setback and sign location additional signage may be appropriate for buildings with less visibility particularly where buffering is providing an aesthetic and  or environmental benefit to the city  c frontage larger frontages may justify more or larger signs particularly if the size of the frontage tends to prevent sign clutter from multiple adjacent parcels  d access and visibility to the site  e intended traffic circulation pattern and the need for wayfinding  f hierarchy of signage  g relationship between the site and adjacent uses  and h the desired function of the site eg an urban center would tend to include signage that is more urban and more dynamic in character than a strip shopping center  article 5 signs v  2 additionally the maximum permitted sign area shall be based on the following formula when evaluated against the above criteria a the maximum area permitted for attached signage shall range from one percent up to a maximum of six percent of the building facade to which the sign is to be attached b the maximum total permitted area of all freestanding signs on a parcel proposed for development shall not exceed 20 percent more than the total sign area that would otherwise be permitted by this community character the signage proposed in a sign design program shall not have an adverse impact

converging line at measured distances from the corner and identified as such in the description and on the plat of the property built drawings asbuilt drawings certified by a registered surveyor shall be submitted to the city upon completion of subdivision infrastructure article 7 storm water management  v  article 7 storm water management division  purpose and application of purpose a findings of fact 1 it is hereby determined that a land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition  b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants  and c stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites 2 the city recognizes that water quality and quantity requirements of federal state and parish laws applicable to surface waters provide reasonable guidance for the control of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation 3 it is determined that the control of stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to manage and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety b purpose of regulations that apply to permanent controls and maintenance the purpose of division  drainage is to ensure that stormwater management requirements and controls are in place to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public division  drainage requires plans that are reviewed according to performance standards promulgated by east baton rouge parish the state of louisiana and the federal government depending upon the circumstances of the individual application it also includes specifications for construction of drainage facilities c purpose of regulations that apply to construction activities during the construction process soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of lakes in addition clearing and grading during construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat consequently the purpose of division  stormwater management during construction is to implement federal laws that seek to safeguard persons protect property and prevent damage to the environment  article 7 storm water management v  of generally drainage plans and stormwater pollution prevention programs for construction activities are required as provided in federal and state law b when required storm water management is applicable to all subdivision or site plan applications unless eligible for an exemption the ordinance also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that is not exempt even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules in addition all plans must also be reviewed by federal state and local environmental protection officials with jurisdiction to ensure that established water quality standards will be maintained during and after development of the site and that post construction runoff levels are consistent with any local and regional watershed plans c construction with other articles and ordinances this not intended to interfere with abrogate or annul any other ordinance rule or regulation stature or other provision of law the requirements of this be considered minimum requirements and where any provision of this restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance rule or regulation or other provision of law whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence division  drainage impact study requirement a requirement 1 drainage impact studies required any owner developer subdivider or their agents who apply to subdivide develop improve or build upon any residential industrial or commercial development or subdivision must in addition to any other requirement of law or ordinance submit a drainage impact study in conformity with this number of copies  required review two copies of the required drainage impact study of the proposed development and surrounding affected areas must be submitted the subdivision construction plans will not be reviewed and approved until the drainage impact analysis has been reviewed the public works department may refer the study for review by east baton rouge parish the state of louisiana or appropriate federal agencies b exemptions 1 mandatory exemptions the following development activities are exempted from the requirements of preparing a drainage impact study a development in which the area of impervious surface does not exceed 20 percent of the development area at the point of discharge from the site the total impervious area shall include all buildings driveways sidewalks streets parking lots lakes ponds etc all undeveloped open space common area etc must be clearly identified article 7 storm water management  v  b additions or modifications to existing developments which result in no more than a ten percent increase in existing impervious area and which have existing public storm drainage facilities designed to accommodate runoff from the existing site 2 discretionary exemptions developers may request that the planning and zoning commission approve an exemption from providing the drainage impact study if such a request is granted the planning and zoning commission director will provide written approval a copy of the exemption authorization shall be forwarded to the public works director and no detailed drainage impact study shall be required for the development an exemption under this section must be requested in writing that includes specific details of the proposed development an exemption under this section shall be considered for approval provided a the proposed development results in no more than a ten year predevelopment peak discharge at the point of discharge from the development site b the site is located within existing developed areas which

reduce the number of workrelated car trips and parking requirements by incentivizing the use of bicycles carpools or shuttles the responsible official may authorize up to a five percent reduction in the number of required off street parking spaces for development that provides transportation demand management programs examples of accommodations that would qualify for the credit include 1 enclosed

council recognizes that uses may have different hours of operation and peak parking demand hours the city desires to encourage the sharing of parking for its potential to reduce paved areas and  or enhance the efficiency of land use where a mix of uses creates synergy with respect to the use of parking spaces due to differences in when the spaces are most likely to be used the city may reduce the required number of spaces according to the provisions of this shared parking table shared parking allows a reduction in the total number of required parking spaces when a parcel is occupied by two or more uses which typically do not experience peak use of parking areas at the same time when any land or building is used for two or more uses that are listed below the minimum total number of required parking spaces may be determined by the following procedures 1 multiply the minimum required parking for each individual use excluding spaces reserved for use by specified individuals or classes of individuals eg spaces that are either posted reserved or secured behind a gate by the appropriate percentage listed in table  shared parking table for each of the designated time periods 2

not achieve strict compliance with access spacing and corner clearance the requirements shall be utilized if they result in wider spacing between access points than would be provided in the absence of the requirements table  compliance with access management regulations situation objective method of compliance existing lot proposed for development does not meet arterial frontage requirements of minimum arterial frontage but has access to a local side street shift access to side streets abut intersections of arterial streets and local streets shall take access from the local street if the access meets the corner clearance requirements of access management and corner clearance existing lot proposed for development abuts lots that are built have individual access connections and do not comply with spacing requirements allow reasonable access for existing lots but consolidate access at first available opportunity existing access may be maintained but if thresholds of are met then compliance with is required if there is no existing access then temporary access may be created upon demonstration of compliance with existing lot proposed for development does not conform to minimum arterial frontage and at least one abutting lot under separate ownership is not developed allow reasonable access for existing lot and ensure that future development will have shared or cross access as necessary to ensure compliance with this division provide access in compliance with the access spacing and corner clearance standards of access spacing and corner clearance and provide for future common access as will ensure implementation of such standards as provided in common access and internal cross access existing lot proposed for development abuts another lot that is under common ownership with the lot proposed for development ensure that development of commonly owned property does not frustrate citys access management objectives be consolidated if necessary to meet the minimum frontage required by minimum arterial frontage and meet the access spacing and corner clearance standards of access spacing and corner clearance  or applicant provides for common access  and the common access meets the requirements of access spacing and corner clearance to the maximum extent possible lot proposed for development abuts another lot which has recorded a covenant pursuant to common access and internal cross access ensure that recorded common access and cross access covenants are carried out common access or internal cross access is provided as set out in the recorded document if the common access point would prevent an adjacent undeveloped lot from complying with this division then a covenant to provide common or cross access shall be provided as set out in common access and internal cross access c timing of compliance with this division 1 new development and subdivision shall demonstrate compliance with this division for each required development approval 2 properties with access connections that do not meet the requirements of this division shall be brought into compliance to the greatest extent possible when modifications to the roadway are made or when a change in use results in one or more of the following conditions a a connection permit is required b site review or platting is required c the site experiences an increase of 20 percent or greater in peak hour trips or 100 vehicles per hour in the peak hour whichever is less as determined by one of the following methods i an estimation based on the institute of traffic engineers ite trip generation manual latest edition methodology for typical land uses or article 9 parking loading access and lighting  update effective  ii traffic counts made at similar traffic generators located in the city or iii actual traffic monitoring conducted during the peak hour of the adjacent roadway traffic for the property 3 if the principal activity on a parcel with access connections that do not meet the regulations of this division is discontinued for a period of one year or more then upon establishment of any use the parcel must comply with all applicable access requirements of this division to the greatest extent possible of access management requirements a reduction of spacing requirements the spacing requirements of access spacing and corner clearance may be reduced in any of the following circumstances 1 spacing may be based on an assessment of the individual safety and operational considerations of the proposed connection if a current average daily trip adt volume on the segment of the arterial upon which the proposed development fronts is below 2000  and b it is demonstrated that there is little if any potential for development within 25 years that would raise the adt to more than 2000 2 where adequate access connection spacing cannot be achieved for example if the depth of an existing block is less than the distance required between intersections the city may permit lesser spacing when shared access is established with an abutting property a shared access agreement shall be executed and recorded as provided in common access and internal cross access 3 where no other alternatives exist construction of an access connection may be allowed along the property line farthest from the intersection or closest access to provide reasonable access under these conditions but also provide the safest operation consideration should be given to designing the driveway connection to allow only the rightin turning movement or only the rightin right out turning movements if feasible in such a case the applicant shall demonstrate that a the inability to meet the access spacing requirements was not due to the owner subdividing the property after the effective date of this udc without providing internal access  b a reasonable offer with regard to crossaccess was refused by the adjacent landowner  and c a covenant acceptable to the city to ensure that the connection will be provided and access will be consolidated upon the earlier of i approval for development substantial improvement or redevelopment of the adjacent property if providing such connection is a requirement of the approval  or ii the applicants parcel and the adjacent parcel coming under common ownership  and d failure to comply with the access spacing requirements will not materially affect the safe and efficient flow of traffic 4 if natural resource eg wetland or floodway protection requires an alternative access b increase of spacing requirements the city may require greater access spacing if the use will generate significant truck traffic c waiver of street intersection spacing the spacing of street intersections may be reduced if article 9 parking loading access and lighting  update effective  1 there is no alternative that would bring one or more roads to connection points opposite a local road on the opposite side of the street and avoid the staggered

application of purpose of generally applying new regulations to existing development is likely to create situations where existing lot dimensions development density or intensity land uses buildings structures landscaping parking areas or signs do not strictly comply with the new requirements the nc district is intended to minimize these nonconformities in established neighborhoods by making existing buildings and lots that were lawfully constructed or created conforming for existing lots or development including uses buildings structures and signs that are legally nonconforming this out fair rules for whether when and how the regulations of this udc apply b expansion of nonconformities generally nonconforming uses buildings structures and signs are not allowed to be enlarged expanded increased nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses that are now prohibited in the same zoning district this standards by which minor nonconforming uses can be made conforming public hearing process c reduction of nonconformities it is the policy of the city to encourage reinvestments in property that increase its value and utility and improve its quality and character since bringing a developed parcel into full compliance with this udc may involve substantial cost which could discourage reinvestment this a set of thresholds for determining when new construction or modifications to development trigger a requirement for meeting the various standards of this udc d unlawful uses buildings structures or signs this not authorize or legitimize uses buildings structures or signs that were not legally established or constructed such uses buildings structures or signs are not legally nonconforming but instead remain unlawful and are subject to all of the provisions of this udc including enforcement provisions and any other applicable law likewise this not legitimize unlawful subdivisions of property that may have occurred before the effective date of this udc of generally this to uses buildings structures landscaping signs parking and lots that were lawfully constructed or established but do not conform to the requirements of this udc it does not apply to lots of record in the nc zoning district regardless of their size such lots are conforming b types of nonconformities there are seven general types of nonconformities uses buildings structures landscaping signs parking and lots as to uses nonconformities may be major or minor these types are set out in types and classes of nonconformities the application of the standards of this based on the type of nonconformity that is being addressed c general regulations division  general regulations sets out the standards for when nonconforming situations must be made conforming or more conforming or alternatively  article 12 nonconformities v  terminated or removed it also sets out the circumstances in which a nonconforming situation may be restored or resumed after damage destruction or temporary cessation d compliance thresholds division  compliance thresholds sets out the standards for determining when new construction or modifications to development trigger a requirement for conformity with the various requirements of this udc e conversion of nonconformities division  conversion of nonconformities sets out how to convert a nonconforming use to a conforming use using a conditional use process nonconforming buildings and structures may be made conforming with a variance see variance requirements f effect of effect on existing development entitlements nothing in this udc shall be interpreted to require a change in plans construction or designated use of any building in which a building permit was lawfully issued prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this udc provided construction was commenced within 60 days after obtaining said building permit and diligently completed 2 effect on existing unlawful uses buildings signs and structures any use building structure andor parcel of land which was used erected or maintained in violation of any previous zoning regulations shall not be considered as a legal nonconforming use building structure andor parcel and shall be required to comply with all provisions of this udc division  types and classes of nonconformities uses a generally a nonconforming use is a use of land that was lawfully established ie it was allowed and issued a permit if a permit was required at the time the use was established on a parcel or lot before the effective date of this udc that is no longer allowed after the effective date of this udc amendments to this udc may also make uses nonconforming the following uses are legally nonconforming uses 1 uses that were lawfully established but are not currently listed as permitted limited or conditional uses in the district in division  permitted limited conditional and prohibited uses 2 uses that are listed as limited uses in the district in division  permitted limited conditional and prohibited uses but were lawfully established without a limited use permit and do not comply with the applicable standards of division  limited and conditional use standards 3 uses that are listed as conditional uses in the district in division  permitted limited conditional and prohibited uses but were lawfully established without a conditional use permit for these uses the nonconforming use status may be removed by obtaining a conditional use permit article 12 nonconformities  v  4 uses that were lawfully established within a floodplain or floodway but are no longer permitted in the floodplain or floodway b classifications of nonconforming uses there are two types of nonconforming uses major nonconforming uses and minor nonconforming uses the classification of the nonconforming use affects whether it can be converted to a conforming use 1 major nonconforming uses major nonconforming uses are those uses for which the nonconformity generates a nuisance per se or represents such incompatibility with adjacent uses andor the comprehensive plan that public policy favors their elimination from the district if they are discontinued abandoned or destroyed major nonconforming uses are a mobile homes 2 minor nonconforming uses all nonconforming uses that are not classified as major nonconforming uses are minor nonconforming uses such uses may be converted to conforming uses as provided in division  conversion of nonconformities buildings a nonconforming building is a building that was lawfully constructed prior to the effective date of this udc or amendment hereto that does not conform to the height yard building coverage density intensity building scale or design standards that are applicable to the same type of building in the district in which the building is located structures a nonconforming structure is a structure other than a building that was lawfully constructed prior to the effective date of this udc or amendment hereto that does not conform to the standards that are applicable to the same type of structure in the district in which the structure is located the following are illustrative examples of nonconforming structures 1 fences or garden walls that do not comply with the height setback or materials standards of this udc  and 2 structures that are located in floodplains floodways or open space areas that do not comply with the applicable regulations of this udc landscaping a generally nonconforming landscaping is landscaping or lack thereof that does not conform to the landscape area or planting requirements of landscaping or other provisions of this udc that require the designation of open space or landscape surface areas or the buffering of uses see eg division  limited and conditional use standards and district intensity and development standards nonresidential mixeduse and multifamily residential parcels that were lawfully developed but do not include the required landscape surface ratio or open space ratio that is required after the effective date of this udc or amendment hereto are also nonconforming with respect to landscaping  article 12 nonconformities v  b exception residential development of housing types other than multifamily is conforming with respect to landscaping if it was platted prior to the effective date of this udc signs a permanent signs any permanent sign located within the city limits on the effective date of this udc that does not conform to the provisions of signs or if applicable division  limited and conditional use standards is a legal nonconforming sign provided it also meets the following requirements 1 the sign was approved by a sign permit on the effective date of this udc or amendment hereto if a permit was required under applicable law  or 2 if no sign permit was required under applicable law for the sign in question the sign a was in all respects in conformity with the applicable law or there was no applicable law immediately prior to the effective date  or b had legal nonconforming status at such time b temporary signs temporary signs that are not in compliance with this udc shall be removed as required by signs parking nonconforming parking refers to parking spaces drive aisles and loading areas that do not conform to the requirements of this code that are set out in parking loading access and lighting in terms of their number or dimensions generally nonconforming lots are lots that were lawfully created before the effective date of this udc or amendments hereto but which no longer comply with the lot width frontage area or access requirements of this udc b exception all lots within nc districts that were lawfully created before the effective date of this udc are conforming regardless of their dimensions division  general regulations restoration and removal a generally this out the standards for when a nonconformity must be terminated or removed and when it is allowed to be restored after temporary cessation damage or destruction b nonconforming uses 1 if a major nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of six months for any reason it shall not be resumed 2 if a minor nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of six months for any reason it shall not be resumed however if an application for conversion of the use is filed pursuant to article 12 nonconformities  v  division  conversion of nonconformities before the end of the six month period the use may be resumed as a conforming use after the period expires if the application is granted c nonconforming buildings structures and elements of buildings or structures 1 if a nonconforming building or structure or nonconforming element thereof is damaged or destroyed by any means or be declared unsafe by the building inspector to an extent that repairs would exceed more than 50 percent of the replacement cost of the building or damaged nonconforming element the building shall be reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this udc 2 if the reconstruction cost andor area of reconstruction whichever is less is less than or equal to 50 percent of the cost of replacement or area of the building respectively then the structure may be strengthened or restored to a safe condition provided that a the original nonconformity is not enlarged increased or extended  b building permits are obtained for repairs within 12 months of the date the building was damaged or if no date can be reasonably established for the damage the date that the building inspector determines that the building is unsafe  and c the construction is commenced within 12 months after obtaining the required building permits d nonconforming landscaping nonconforming landscaping shall be made conforming as provided in division  compliance thresholds e nonconforming signs or sign elements 1 a nonconforming sign which has been damaged by fire wind or other cause in excess of 50 percent of its replacement cost shall not be restored except in conformance with this udc 2 if a nonconforming sign structure is does not display any message for a period of three months it shall be removed or brought into conformance with this udc 3 if a nonconforming sign structure is removed for any reason other than routine repair and maintenance it shall not be replaced unless the replacement sign conforms to this udc 4 nonconforming signs that are a danger to the public safety due to damage or wear shall be removed and shall not be replaced unless the replacement sign conforms to this udc of use a generally a nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use b effect of change of use 1 if a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use the nonconforming use shall not be resumed 2 if the use of only a portion of a building or property is changed from a nonconforming use to a conforming use then the use of that portion of the building or property shall not be changed back to the nonconforming use  article 12 nonconformities v  modifications a generally repairs and modifications to nonconforming buildings structures and signs is permitted as provided in this except that nonconforming buildings and structures that are located in floodplains are subject to the restrictions of nonconforming buildings and structures in floodplains and not this repairs and alterations 1 buildings and structures routine maintenance of nonconforming buildings and structures is permitted including necessary nonstructural repairs paint and incidental alterations which do not extend or intensify the nonconforming buildings or structures or materially extend their life this standard also applies to buildings or structures that are used by nonconforming uses if they are designed in a way that is not suitable for reuse as a conforming use if the building is conforming and could be reused for a conforming use there is no limitation on its maintenance 2 buildings containing major nonconforming uses no building or structure that contains a major nonconforming use shall be enlarged unless the major nonconforming use is permanently discontinued 3 signs routine maintenance of nonconforming signs is permitted including nonstructural repairs and paint even if such repairs would materially extend the life of the sign changes to the sign face or messages and incidental alterations that do not increase the nonconformity or sign area structural repairs or changes are not allowed if the sign requires structural repairs because it has been damaged destroyed or worn it shall be removed or altered in accordance with subsection b4 below 4 structural alterations structural alterations to nonconforming buildings structures and signs are permitted only if it is demonstrated that the alteration will eliminate the nonconformity or reduce it in accordance with the standards of division  compliance thresholds c expansion of nonconforming uses 1 major nonconforming uses major nonconforming uses shall not be expanded enlarged extended increased or moved to occupy an area of land or building that was not occupied on the effective date of this udc or any amendment that made the use a major nonconforming use 2 minor nonconforming uses no minor nonconforming use shall be expanded or extended in such a way as to a occupy any open space or landscaped area that is required by this udc  b exceed building coverage intensity or height limitations of the zoning district in which the use is located  c occupy any land beyond the boundaries of the

construction a combination of increase conformity 1 where a landowner owns several abutting lots that do not conform to the dimensional requirements of the district in which they are located they shall combined to create fully conforming lots or if full conformity is not possible they shall be combined if the combination will increase the degree of conformity see figure  combination of nonconforming the city will not require the combination of lots pursuant to paragraph a1 above if a the combination of lots would not address the nonconformity see figure  combination of nonconforming   b the combination of lots would materially disrupt the lotting pattern of the street for example by creating a midblock on a street segment that does not include any other see figure  combination of nonconforming   c two or more of the lots are developed with principal buildings and the combination of lots would require that one or more of the buildings be torn down in order to comply with this udc see figure  combination of nonconforming   d the combination of lots would result in regularly shaped lots being combined into a single lot with an irregular shape see figure  combination of nonconforming   or e the lots are located in the nc district in which case they are not nonconforming figure  combination of nonconforming construction on legal do not conform to dimensional requirements a legal lot that does not meet district requirements with respect to lot area or lot width may be built upon if 1 the lot is a lot of record  and 2 the use is permitted in the district in which the lot is located   article 12 nonconformities v  3 the lot has sufficient frontage on a public street to provide access that is appropriate for the proposed use  and 4 all yards or height standards are complied with except that the responsible official may authorize a reduction of required yards of up to 10 percent provided that the the responsible official finds that the reduction does not allow a building that would be larger than a building that would be permitted on the minimum conforming lot in the district buildings and structures in floodplains it is the intent of the city of zachary that no permanent structures be located or substantially improved in the floodplain except according to the standards in flood damage prevention of the city of zachary ordinances and

division  compliance thresholds created by public action any nonconforming structure or land expressly created or caused by a conveyance of privately owned land to a federal state or local government to serve a public purpose is conforming for the purposes of this udc and is not subject to the limitations of this exemption applies only in cases where private land is obtained by a governmental entity for a public purpose threat of condemnation or otherwise which creates a nonconformity in the remainder parcel in terms of setback lot size or other standards of this udc this exemption does not apply to rightofway dedication or other public conveyances of land required by the city in the course of subdivision or other routine development plan approvals article 12 nonconformities  v

area or negatively affect the anticipated development or redevelopment trajectory  2 there is no practicable alternative location where the use is permitted asofright within onequarter mile of the parcel proposed for development or if such a location exists the proposed location is more favorable in terms of providing a needed community service to a population that has limited mobility  3 the approval of the conditional use will not create a critical mass of similar conditional uses that is likely to tend to discourage permitted uses by making the vicinity less desirable for them  and

balance of two continuums both of which have ends that at their extremes are unattractive the balance shall be struck between a monotony and chaos  and b unity and interest 3 quality quality not only refers to the materials and care with which a building or environment is built but also to its visual richness eg details that are attractive to the resident or visitor in order to ensure visual interest the pattern book shall demonstrate the following a singlefamily homes attached or detached are designed to provide a unit that has a unified appearance from the street with any street faade front faade and street side faade having comparable treatment in materials color and trim b if masonry is used on a front faade it is also applied to side facades in one or more of the following ways i masonry returns to a break in the side faade such as a chimney room projection or projecting window area  ii an architectural return is applied to all corners so that the greater of ten percent of the length of the side building wall or three feet is finished with masonry to the same height as the front facade  iii quoins are used if consistent with the architectural typology of the building  iv an architectural detail with a minimum width of 16 inches is applied such as a pilaster that caps the masonry and the other material that completes the corner  or v a wing wall screens the view of the side of the building from the street c detached singlefamily homes will be articulated and detailed and shall avoid undue imposition of building mass on the street  article 14 permits and procedures v  d there should be some detailing or doors windows and their trim that carries around the buildings sides so that even if the trim is plainer they show a relationship to the general style and character of the front e front porches will be provided on all detached housing types within 1320 feet along street centerlines from the center subdistrict and may be provided elsewhere and on other housing types f balconies will be provided on all multistory townhomes and multistory multifamily buildings g utility meters shall not be on front or side elevations unless screened by vegetation or other approved screening 4 diversity the pattern book shall demonstrate that one or more of the techniques below will be used to achieve harmony the pattern book is not required to include all of these elements a varied housing types at a finegrained scale multiple housing types are required yet this requirement could result in areas or pods of each type which has the potential to lead to monotony mixing types on a smaller scale even having differing dwelling unit types in a block face is a technique to reduce monotony and add interest b varied architectural styles different architectural styles eg colonial revival and neoclassical can be used to vary the appearance of buildings with comparable floor plans the variations in architectural styles must be meaningful but must not create a chaotic appearance for this technique to be reviewed a number of elements including roof type and orientation roof pitch eve overhangs windows doors decorative elements shall be specified for each architectural style that will be used in the tnd the reference for architectural style shall be a field guide to american houses by virginia and lee mcalester et al knopf 1984 c varied floor plans if floor plans are meaningfully different homes will look different if floor plans are not meaningfully different homes will often look monotonous the differences in floor plans must significantly alter the width and shape in order to present a building volume or mass that is different such differences include but are not limited to i minimum of 10 percent difference in front faade width  or ii different forms rectangle l or x shapes if the differences affect the front faade  or iii different numbers of stories  or iv different symmetry symmetrical or asymmetrical d varied gable orientation in many cases a front or side gable roof can be constructed over the same floor plan this change significantly alters the roof profile of the house its front elevation massing and may also alter the height of the roof peak e varied elements the pattern book may demonstrate that architectural elements will be varied in a way that creates meaningful differences in building appearance such details may include trims materials color window arrangement grouping window fenestration doors door lights window and garage doors porches chimneys bay windows towers article 14 permits and procedures  v  and balconies as necessary to create the required variation this technique is particularly useful when a single architectural style or two very closely related styles eg prairie and craftsman are used in the development the pattern book must include detailed elevations lists of specific elements to be used and an explanation of how the elements will be mixed to differentiate nearby buildings f averaged lot width meaningful variation of lot width generally causes meaningful variations in building width and floor plan a pattern book may show that block faces will include lots of varying widths as follows i three lots size categories for each type of housing are created using a required average eg 50 percent of the lots would be average 25 percent small and the remainder large ii the difference in frontage among the lot sizes should be in the range of 10 to 20 percent for example an average 10000 square foot lot that is 80 feet wide is 125 feet deep the small lot could be 70 feet wide and the large lot 90 feet wide the resulting lots all 125 feet deep would have areas of 8750 10000 and 11250 square feet 5 light and air the pattern of development and the open space available on each lot and for the community are such that adequate light and air are provided for residents residents of the general subdistrict and edge subdistrict shall have a private outdoor space that is at least 100 square feet in dimension and which may be a rear lawn courtyard patio deck or useable rooftop area 6 pedestrianorientation the pattern book shall demonstrate

establish the methodologies for the calculations and measurements that are required by this udc of calculations and measurements of this be used wherever they are called for in this udc division  calculations site area a generally base site area is used to calculate gross density see density b calculation base site area equals the total area of the parcel proposed for development gross site area minus the sum of the areas of the following 1 land within the planned rightofway of existing streets or streets that are on the adopted thoroughfare plan of the city of zachary 2 land that is within major utility rightsofway that are wider than 50 feet 3 land that is cut off from development by railroads limited access highways waterbodies or wetlands 4 land that has previously been set aside as protected open space eg subject to a conservation easement plat restriction or condition of development approval see figure  illustrative calculation of base site area figure  illustrative calculation of base site area  article 17 calculations v  buildable area a generally net buildable area is used to calculate net density see density b calculation net buildable area is equal to the lesser of 1 base site area calculated as provided in base site area minus areas of open water streams are measured to the ordinary mean high water mark and delineated wetlands that were not already subtracted from the area of the parcel proposed for development to calculate the base site area eg wetlands or open water areas that are within previously dedicated conservation easements or cut off from development by a limited access highway are not subtracted more than once  or 2 the total area of the parcel proposed for development minus the area of open space required for the development type in residential density open space and parcel standards figure  illustrative calculation of net buildable area using a 30 percent open space ratio for illustrative purposes the net buildable area for the lefthand illustration is calculated as base site area minus areas of open water and delineated wetlands  and the net buildable area for the righthand illustration is calculated as the total area of the parcel proposed for development minus the area of required open space space ratio a generally open space ratio osr and landscape surface ratio lsr see landscape surface ratio are related concepts osr applies to residential development and refers to commonly owned open space open space that is not located on private lots the open space ratio is not necessarily a measure of green open space on a parcel proposed for development as it may also refer to areas of open water b calculation of requirement this subsection sets out how to calculate how much commonlyowned open space is required in a residential development 1 the amount of commonlyowned open space that is required in a residential development is calculated as the required osr see table  residential parcel standards times the total area of the parcel proposed for development article 17 calculations  v  2 the required osr is a minimum requirement an increased osr may result if the sum of the areas required for compliance with bufferyard requirements natural resource protection requirements stormwater management requirements parking lot landscaping requirements recreation requirements and state or federal environmental laws is greater than the open space that would be required by application of the minimum osr c calculation of compliance this subsection sets out how to calculate the osr of a proposed development in order to determine whether it complies with the requirements of this udc 1 the osr of a parcel proposed for development is calculated by dividing the total amount of commonlyowned open space on the parcel by the total area of the parcel see figure  illustrative measurement of open space ratio 2 open spaces that qualify for the calculation of osr include all areas of commonlyowned open space that are larger than 320 contiguous square feet in area including but not limited to a bufferyards whether required by this not  b areas of protected natural resources  c stormwater management systems except enclosed systems  d passive recreation areas  and e parking lot landscaping 3 open spaces that do not qualify for the calculation of osr include any areas on private buildable lots and any commonlyowned open space that is less than 320 contiguous square feet figure  illustrative measurement of open space ratio example 6 acres of common open space divided by 12 acre area of parcel proposed for development equals 50% osr total area of parcel proposed for development 12 acres  article 17 calculations v  surface ratio a generally landscape surface ratio lsr and open space ratio osr see open space ratio are related concepts lsr applies to nonresidential development it refers to landscaped areas and open spaces that are not to be used for development b calculation of requirement this subsection sets out how to calculate how much landscaped open space is required in a nonresidential development 1 the amount of landscaped open space that is required in a nonresidential development is calculated as the required lsr see table  nonresidential and mixed use parcel standards times the total area of the parcel proposed for development 2 the required lsr is a minimum requirement an increased lsr may result if the sum of the areas required for compliance with bufferyard requirements natural resource protection requirements stormwater management requirements parking lot landscaping requirements and state or federal environmental laws is greater than the open space that would be required by application of the minimum lsr c calculation of compliance this subsection sets out how to calculate the lsr of a proposed development in order to determine whether it complies with the requirements of this udc 1 the lsr of a parcel proposed for development is calculated by dividing the total amount of designated landscaped and open space area on the parcel by the total area of the parcel see figure  illustrative measurement of landscape surface ratio 2 open spaces that qualify for the calculation of lsr include all areas of designated landscaped areas and open space that are larger than 320 contiguous square feet in area including but not limited to a bufferyards whether required by this not  b areas of protected natural resources  c stormwater management sytems except enclosed systems  d passive recreation areas  and e parking lot landscaping 3 landscaped areas that are less than 320 contiguous square feet in area do not count and landscaped opn space for the purposes of calculating lsr article 17 calculations  v  figure  illustrative measurement of landscape surface ratio example 5 acres of bufferyards parking lot landscaping and drainage facilities divided by 12 acre area of parcel proposed for development equals 417% lsr area of parcel proposed for development 12 acres a generally 1 density is measured in two ways gross density and net density the maximum number of units that are allowed in a residential development shall not exceed the lesser of the results of the gross density and net density calculations for the parcel proposed for development where density is measured in rooms per acre eg residential eldercare facilities only sleeping rooms are counted 2 the site capacity calculator provided in appendix a of the electronic version of this udc allows a user to input data about a parcel proposed for development and automatically calculate the number of dwelling units that may be built on the parcel b gross density gross density is the number of dwelling units or rooms where so specified per acre of base site area see base site area an example calculation is provided in figure  illustrative density calculations c net density net density is calculated by dividing the number of dwelling units or rooms where so specified by the net buildable area of the parcel proposed for development an example calculation is provided in figure  illustrative density calculations  article 17 calculations v  figure a illustrative density calculations example 28 homes are planned for an 11 acre parcel gross density the parcel proposed for development is 11 acres 25 acres including forest and open water were previously dedicated as a conservation easement and 02 acres within planned rightofway of abutting street there are no areas within major utility corridors or cut off from development therefore the base site area is 11  25  02 or 83 acres 28 homes divided by 83 acres equals a gross density of approximately 338 units per acre net density the required open space ratio in this example is 50 percent therefore the net buildable area is the lesser of 50 percent times 11 acres 55 acres or the base site area minus open water and wetlands since the open water area was counted in the base site area calculation because it is subject to a conservation easement it is not subtracted again accordingly the net buildable area is 55 acres because 55 acres is less than 83 acres the net density is 28 homes divided by 55 acres or 510 units per acre area ratio a generally the unit of measurement for intensity is called floor area ratio far b calculation 1 for individual lots far is calculated by dividing the total floor area on the lot by the lot area 2 for parcels proposed for development gross far is calculated by dividing the total floor area on the parcel proposed for development by the base site area see figure  illustrative floor area ratio calculation c structured parking exception the floor area of structured parking facilities is not included in the calculation of far article 17 calculations  v  figure  illustrative floor area ratio calculation example the example below is 88000 square feet of floor area located on a parcel with a 12 acre base site area its far is 80000 square feet floor area divided by 522720 square feet of base site area 12 acres times 43560 square feet per acre equals  far area lot area is the area within the lot lines see figure  illustrative lot area calculation figure  illustrative lot area calculation example the example at right is a rectangular lot 80 feet wide times 125 feet deep equals 10000 square feet lot area coverage a building coverage building coverage is the total of areas taken on a horizontal plane at the main grade level of the principal building and all accessory buildings exclusive of uncovered porches terraces and steps all dimensions are measured between the exterior faces of walls b building coverage ratio building coverage ratio is building coverage divided by lot area see figure  building coverage ratio illustration  article 17 calculations v  figure  building coverage ratio illustration division  measurements space the following qualify as open space for the purposes of this udc 1 outdoor recreation areas all forms of outdoor recreation areas will count toward the required open space from passive areas and nature reserves to ball fields tennis courts swimming pools and golf courses there are limitations on the development of some of these 2 stormwater facilities open air stormwater facilities count as open space it is desirable that stormwater be treated and routed into natural drainage areas rather than piped in storm sewers for significant distances these facilities may be permitted in floodplains even though they are protected from being part of the developed portion of the site 3 bufferyards the required bufferyards are counted as open space 4 required landscape areas required landscape areas such as parking lot landscaping areas are counted as open space however landscaping of private lots in residential subdivisions is not counted as open space 5 agriculture agriculture counts as an open space in cluster planned or conservation cluster development options when it is part of the development plan 6 resource protection areas all areas that are protected for natural resource value are counted as open space width a generally lot width is the distance from one side lot line to the opposite side lot line at the front setback line see figure a calculation of lot width  standard calculations  v  figure a measurement of lot width  standard corner width for regulatory purposes is the distance from the interior side lot line to the side street lot line measured at the front building line minus the difference between the street yard setback and the side yard setback see figure b calculation of lot width  corner b measurement of lot width  corner irregular width is the distance from one side lot line to the opposite side lot line at the front building line see figure c calculation of lot width  irregular the front building line is the front setback line however an alternative front building line may be established on the plat of a subdivision that is more distant than the front setback line from the front lot line lot width must be maintained to a depth that is sufficient to accommodate a reasonable building in the context of adjacent and nearby lots  article 17 calculations v  figure c measurement of lot width  irregular setbacks a generally setbacks are measured from lot lines towards the center of the lot as follows 1 front setbacks are measured from the front lot line the front lot line is the lot line that abuts the rightofway from which the lot takes its address 2 rear setbacks are measured from the rear lot line the rear lot line is the lot line that is opposite from the front lot line 3 side setbacks are measured from side lot lines side lot lines are lot lines that intersect with front lot lines b flag flag lots setbacks are measured as provided in subsection a above except that the front setback line is measured from the shared lot line see figure  setback measurement figure  setback measurement article 17 calculations  v  a buildings building height is calculated by measuring the vertical distance from the average finished grade along the front building line to 1 the highest peak or ridge line of the roof for pitched roof styles  or 2 the top of the parapet for flat roof styles b other structures structure height is calculated by measuring the vertical distance from the average finished grade around the base of the structure to the highest point on the structure this measurement applies to 1 structures without roofs eg fences  and 2 amateur radio antennae whether mounted on a roof the ground or another structure c specialized structures and building appurtenances 1 specialized structures and building appurtenances are not counted in the calculation of building height provided that a they project not more than i 15 feet above the highest point on the building for buildings that are two stories in height or higher  or ii seven feet above the highest point on the building for buildings that are less than two stories in height b they occupy not more than ten percent of the total roof area of the building  and c they are not used for human habitation commercial
