to accommodate this situation this section establishes the conditional use district process the conditional use district process is established to address those situations involving a rezoning when a particular use may be acceptable but the general classification which would allow that use would not be acceptable it allows the city council to approve a rezoning proposal for a specific use with reasonable conditions to assure the compatibility of the use with surrounding properties any use permitted under this process must also conform to the development regulations for the corresponding general zoning district this is a voluntary procedure which is intended for firm development proposals it is not intended or suited for securing early zoning for tentative proposals which may not be undertaken for some time 102  application and review process the following process applies to the conditional use district 1021 application rezoning petitions to establish a conditional use district

and approximate completion time of the project  g a statement analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning shall be prepared for each petition for a rezoning to a special or conditional use district or other smallscale rezoning the application for a conditional use district must contain information andor site plans which indicate all of the principal and accessory uses which are proposed

of   parts 3 5 and 8 of of   and of of the north carolina general statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the town of morehead city north carolina does ordain as follows 1812 findings of fact a the floodprone areas within the jurisdiction of morehead city north carolina are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in floodprone areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 1813 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within floodprone areas by provisions designed to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  1 control filling grading dredging and all other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 2 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 1814 objectives the objectives of this a to protect human life and health  b to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d to minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions  e to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities ie water and gas mains electric telephone cable and sewer lines streets and bridges that are located in floodprone areas  f to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  and g to insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a special flood hazard area  6182003 182  definitions 1821 see basic definitions and interpretations  6182003 183  general provisions 1831 lands
