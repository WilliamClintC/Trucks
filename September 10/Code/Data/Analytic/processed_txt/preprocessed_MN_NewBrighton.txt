direction of the fire chief the original text permitted the city manager to assign members of the building and planning department to serve as inspectors the recodification opens the assignment up to

is equal to the stormwater utility rate multiplied by the parcel area in acres in the case of the single and two family residential land classification a standard lot size of 13 acre will be used to calculate the stormwater utility fee regardless of the actual lot size 3 stormwater utility budget the stormwater utility budget is the estimated annual expenditures for planning reconstruction and maintenance and meeting all state and federal laws rules and regulations pertaining to storm water management of the citys storm sewer system this budget shall be established during the annual budgeting process by the city council    313 fees and rates stormwater fees shall be established by ordinance the following steps will be taken to determine the fee to be charged each property  1 the

environmental constraint overlay area purpose and intent there are certain properties within the city with environmental constraints that were created by past land uses the city recognizes in these situations that conformance with underlying zoning regulations may be difficult due to site characteristics that resulted from those environmental issues andor remediation efforts further the city recognizes that it may not be feasible to comply with underlying zoning designations due to these environmental characteristics rather than leave these sites dormant or allow them to persist as unsightly or underutilized the city wishes to provide a means to develop or use these properties that is both practical and economical the city recognizes that certain deviations from the industrial district standards may be necessary for a viable use to develop and evolve so that landowners are able to make good use of property it is the intent of the environmental constraint overlay area to provide the legislative means to meet land use goals for these unique sites while also imposing such regulations and limitations on the uses or the accumulation of those uses that may occur within the area in order to ensure the adequate protection of the environment and the health safety and welfare of the surrounding properties  designation of the environmental constraint overlay area property
