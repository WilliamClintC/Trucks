purpose and intent transitional features are architectural elements or site aspects used to provide a transition between land uses subdivisions and sites in an effort to mitigate conflicts and to provide design compatibility it is the intent of these standards to 1 blend new development with existing development form and pattern  2 reduce potential adverse impacts between different land uses or buildings differing in scale mass height proportion form or architecture  3 limit the excessive consumption of available land though the utilization of large vegetated buffers  4 limit interruptions in vehicular and pedestrian connections created by efforts to segregate uses  and 5 establish or maintain vibrant pedestrianoriented areas where differing uses can operate in proximity to one another b applicability 1 transitional features shall be required a when design compatibility cannot be achieved between land uses lots or structures  or b between lots or uses within a single mixeduse development located in either traditional or conventional zones 2 in conventional zones the drt may require the use of transitional features in addition to the use of a buffer in accordance with the standards in where such transitional features are necessary to reduce potential adverse impacts between different land uses or buildings differing in scale mass height proportion form or architecture if the applicant disagrees with the decision of the drt regarding the use of transitional features the applicant may appeal the decision planning commission andor council depending on the type of application 3 in traditional zones the drt may require the use of a buffer inlieu of or in addition to the use of a transitional feature where such buffer is necessary to reduce potential adverse impacts between different land uses or buildings differing in scale mass height proportion form or architecture if the applicant disagrees with the decision of the drt regarding the use of buffers or transitional features the applicant may appeal the decision to planning commission andor council depending on the type of application c standards in areas where existing blocks or 500 feet  long frontages including the subject property are at least 75% developed and a transition between different land uses or buildings differing in scale mass height proportion setbacks form or architecture is needed the following approaches shall be used subject to the approval of the zoning official and the building department to establish a transition between uses and buildings 1 for differing uses use setbacks that are within 25 percent of the average setbacks for existing uses on the same block face provided no new use is closer to the rightofway than the closest existing principal structure  2 in residential districts or developments no differing uses no building shall be set back more or located closer to the street than the average of the setbacks of the existing dwellings on the same side of the street within the same block or two hundred fifty 250 feet each side thereof whichever is less 68 figure 62 the new construction outlined in red on the right demonstrates appropriate average setbacks the dwelling outlined in red on the left has a front setback that is too deep 3 use lot widths that are within 40 percent of the average lot width for existing lots on the same block  4 ensure the perceived faade width and height on faades of adjacent structures and structures on opposing sides of a street are consistent with each other such that neither faade exceeds the others dimensions by more than 25 percent  figure 63 ensuring similar faade height and width dimensions of opposing faades can be an effective means of establishing a transition between uses 5 graduate building height scale and mass of any of the following methods a building stepbacks to reduce the bulk of a buildings upper floors  c cont 69 b dividing buildings into smaller parts including detached buildings to reduce effective visual bulk and to maintain the scale and rhythm of the existing pattern of development  c sight lines or angular planes to gauge the appropriate building height necessary to achieve a steady incremental transition  or d other techniques to break up the scale of a building to complement existing development patterns as approved by the drt or the department of neighborhood services figure 64 stepbacks in building heights between different use types can be an effective transitional element 6 use similarly sized and patterned architectural features such as windows doors awnings arcades pilasters cornices wall offsets building materials and other building articulations included on the lower intensity use as depicted in figure 67 figure 65 the example on the bottom demonstrates effective use of transition features 7 locate offstreet parking loading service and utility areas in a manner consistent with similar site features on surrounding sites when adjacent to residential areas offstreet parking loading service and utility areas shall be strategically located to mitigate disturbance to nearby residents additionally loading and service areas shall not front a street and shall be screened in accordance with subsections  perimeter landscape standards and  screening  8 prevent incompatible exterior lighting or sources of audible noise or disturbance from building faades facing lower intensity uses  9 prevent abrupt changes in roof form by allowing adjacent incompatible uses to use similar roof types slopes or arrangements  c cont 610 10 orient outdoor dining gathering areas and other site attributes such as vending machines away from adjacent residential uses  11 orient primary building faades directly across from opposing primary faades regardless of use type as seen in figure 68  and figure 66 organizing buildings so that the primary faades face one another can serve as a transitional feature when two different building types occupy opposing sides of a street 12 when dealing with multibuilding developments on one or more lots establish a continuum of use intensity where uses of moderate intensity colored orange in figure 67 are sited between highintensity uses colored brown in figure 69 and lowintensity uses colored yellow in figure 67 eg office uses between retail and detached residential figure 67 multibuilding developments can be organized to concentrate the highest intensity uses in a single area and feather the intensity and density outwards from high intensity centers  residential development attached and detached residential structures shall comply with the following basic residential design standards a basic standards 1 building compatibility a traditional zones c cont 611 i residential development in traditional zones shall be physically integrated with surrounding residential structures use of design compatibility including elements such as appropriate scale setbacks materials roof forms lot sizes and streetscape figure 68 the detached dwelling in the foreground exhibits compatibility with the surrounding dwellings in regard to design scale setbacks and materials ii when design compatibility cannot be achieved between two or more different residential use types eg detached and attached residential uses transitional features as set forth in be provided b conventional zones within conventional zones either transitional features or buffers see buffers shall be used between adjacent but differing residential use types eg detached and attached residential uses 2 building orientation all residential development within traditional zones shall be located parallel to the associated street or be consistent with existing development patterns rather than being sited at unconventional angles unless irregular lot layouts require alternative orientations a cont 612 figure 69 this image depicts dwellings that are parallel to the street and consistent with one another 3 setbacks setbacks should be in accordance with traditional zoning regulations or conventional zoning regulations 4 faade standards a primary

from the total perimeter of the writing display of color or any background material included in the signs design and encompasses all the signs graphic components and symbols the area calculation will be based on a combination of circles rectangles squares triangles etc as appropriate the signs face is differentiated from the backdrop or structure to which it is fixed and does not include the supporting framework bracing or wall which supports the sign face if a signs components such as complete words phrases and graphics are proposed for a faade without being attached to a singular cabinet or background the area of said components may be calculated separately individual characters shall not be calculated independently from one another b computation of area of multifaced signs the sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point when two identical faces are placed back to back so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than fortytwo 42 inches apart the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces c computation of height the height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at grade level to the top of the highest attached component of the sign including border trim frame supports and all other structural members and appurtenances  permitted signs in hn tn3 tn2 tn1 r1 r2 and r3 districts see table 67 for sign type
