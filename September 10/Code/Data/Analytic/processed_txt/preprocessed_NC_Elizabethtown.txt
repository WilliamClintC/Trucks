the below phased approach will be followed a phase i  voluntary conservation 1 this phase will be enacted when it is determined that one or more of the parameters outlined in  5173 is met if this occurs the consumers will be notified promptly by any or all of the following mailers door hangers public postings at the town hall post offices etc the public will be asked to begin voluntary conservation measures and class iii nonessential uses will be halted 2 if the determining parameters return to seasonal norms the measures will be lifted however failure of the determining parameters to return to a state of seasonal normalcy may require the initiation of phase ii b phase ii  mandatory 1 this phase will begin when the town manager issues a water shortage advisory the consumers will be notified by one of the methods noted in phase i all users will be required to adhere to the voluntary conservation measurers as noted in attachment i to 2 class iii uses will be banned 2018 s11

even days of the month odd numbered addresses will be allowed to water on odd days of the month 4 during phase ii industrial facilities will be required to develop and demonstrate to the town manager a water shortage response program this program should show at least a 25% reduction in water usage c phase iii  emergency 1 this phase will commence with the issuance of a water shortage emergency declaration from the town manager users will be notified by any or all of the methods noted in phase i all users will be required to use voluntary conservation measures outlined in attachment i to class iii uses will be banned and class ii uses will be allowed with the exception of vegetative watering industrial users will be required to implement their water reduction program immediately 2 in addition residential users will be allotted 1000 gallons per month per person per connection if the user uses 1001 to 1250 gallons per month per person per connection a surcharge of 25% will be added to the monthly bill if the user uses 1251 to 1500 gallons per month per person per connection a surcharge of 75% will be added to the monthly water bill if the user uses 1501 or more gallons per month per person per connection a surcharge of 150% will be added to the monthly bill 3 commercial industrial and institutional facilities will be required to reduce their monthly water consumption by 25% of the previous 12 month water consumption average to maintain the current water rate for that month the average water use can be evaluated on an individual basis for facilities with seasonal demand fluctuations a 20% to 24% water use reduction from the previous 12 month water use average will require the town to impose a 25% surcharge on the monthly water bill a 0% to 9% water use reduction from the previous 12month water use average will require the town to impose a 50% surcharge on the monthly water bill an increase of 1% to 25% above the previous 12month water use average will result in

developers for residential business and industrial users 23 2018 s11 24 elizabethtown  building and land use regulations subdivision of land will be explained in the text of this chapter generally the great bulk of subdivision activity is for residential use and takes place in the growing corridors of existing communities b the streets blocks and lots are among the most permanent features of an urban community rarely can past development errors be corrected the town does not spend large sums of money correcting past errors while allowing similar errors to be made in new subdivisions that are located within the citys jurisdiction c land subdivision regulation is one of the most important tools for carrying out plans for the development of the town area land development plans calling for the location of future streets parks and schools can be incorporated into plans for new subdivisions it is customary to require the dedication without cost to the community of public street rightofway and open space land the reservation of sites for public buildings or for later public acquisition is also a frequent practice d the use of subdivision regulations also protects the community in other ways streets that are properly designed and adequately paved will require a minimum amount of maintenance requirements for installing essential utilities paving streets and providing other improvements will discourage the premature and excessive subdivision of land which would inevitably result in scattered development and increase the cost of governmental operation properly subdivided land stabilizes property values and thus strengthens the local tax base e the subdivision chapter will bring the developer the local decisionmaker and the homeowners to a common ground of understanding in an urban environment special note the developer should consult any locally adopted area thoroughfare plan and hazard mitigation plan reference to these plans by the developer will assist in proper street design and subdivision location passed 4300  15202 title this chapter shall be known and may be called as the subdivision regulations of the town of elizabethtown north

wide range of commercial uses for the community as a whole all uses within this district shall have an orderly management of parking and building development with safe access to all adjacent properties and roadways the bc district is the only commercial zoning district allowed within 1500 feet from each side of the rightofway along the nc highway 87 bypass within the zoning jurisdiction of the town of elizabethtown special zoning districts the special zoning district szd allows a large site to be developed with a mixture of land uses according to an approved overall site plan for example a large tract may be developed with a mix of singlefamily and multifamily housing with part of the site also devoted to commercial and office uses the szd district allows for greater flexibility in dimensional standards such as lot sizes and setbacks upon approval of an overall master plan for the entire development the district does not require a rigid separation of different land uses uses are limited to the uses identified in table of uses and activities all of the site specific standards and conditions including a site plan are incorporated into the zoning district regulations for the szd approval of the site plan will establish all zoning requirements for the subject property a szd district shall not be less than three 3 acres in area this negotiated approach to a legislative decision allows maximum flexibility to tailor regulations to a particular site and project but is also has great potential for abuse  both in terms of impacts on individual landowners seeking approval and their neighbors and on the public interests zoning is supposed to promote thus special restrictions have been placed on special zoning special zoning districts may only occur at the owners request and cannot be imposed without the owners agreement the individual conditions and sitespecific standards that can be imposed are limited to those that are needed to bring a project into compliance with town ordinances and adopted plans and to those addressing the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by use of the site the town must assure that all of the factors defining reasonable spot zoning are fully considered and that the public hearing record reflects that consideration special zoning provides important opportunities to carefully tailor regulations to address the interest of the landowner the neighbors and the public the town may use special zoning when it concludes that a particular project should be approved but that the standards in the comparable  6 article 6 zoning districts conventional zoning districts are insufficient to protect neighbors or public interests perhaps because the conventional zoning allows other uses not suitable for the site or dimensional standards inadequate to preserve the neighborhood special zoning often allows a developer to proceed with a project in a way that addresses sitespecific concerns of neighbors and the

nonconforming situations continuation of nonconforming situations and completion of nonconforming projects  nonconforming situations that were otherwise unlawful on the effective date of this be continued subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in of this nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of of this 2 nonconforming lots  when a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations other than the area or width requirements applicable to the district in which the lot is located such a use may be made as of right otherwise the nonconforming lot may be used only in accordance with authorization by the board of adjustment upon request of the property owner the board of adjustment shall authorize such use if it finds that 1 the proposed use is one permitted by the regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located  and 2 the property can be developed as proposed without any significant negative impact on the surrounding property or the public health safety or welfare in issuing the permit authorized by this paragraph the board of adjustment may allow deviations from applicable dimensional requirements such as setback lines and yard size minimums if it finds that no reasonable use of the property can be made without such deviations  whenever this a nonconforming lot and the owner of the nonconforming lot also owns land adjacent to it and a portion of this other land can be combined with the nonconforming lot to create a conforming lot without thereby creating other nonconformities the owner of the nonconforming lot or his successor in interest may not take advantage of the provisions of subsection  of this section extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations  except as specifically provided in this section it shall be unlawful for any person to engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation  2 article 9 nonconforming situations  subject to subsection  of this section a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that when the use was made nonconforming by this was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use however subject to of this article authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building  subject to of this article authorizing completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming except that a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the lot eg a quarry may be expanded to the boundaries of the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming if 10% or more of the earth products had already been removed at the effective date of this the volume intensity or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other paragraphs of this subsection occur  physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land are unlawful if they result in 1 an increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use  2 greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as yard requirements height limitations or density requirements  or 3 the enclosure of the previously unenclosed areas even though those areas were previously used in connection with the nonconforming activity an area is unenclosed unless at least 75% of the perimeter of the area is marked by a permanently constructed wall or fence  minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged major renovation  ie work estimated to cost more than 10% of the appraised value of the structure to be renovated and not required by the partial or total destruction of a structure see  may be done pursuant to authorization by the board of adjustment upon request of the owner the board of adjustment shall grant such authorization  3 article 9 nonconforming situations if it finds that the work will not result in a violation of any other sections of this particularly  or make the property more incompatible with the surrounding neighborhood  notwithstanding any structured used for singlefamily residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use may be replaced with a similar structure of the same size or larger size so long as the replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to yard size and setback requirements in particular a manufactured home may be replaced with a larger manufactured home and a singlewide manufactured home may be replaced with a doublewide this subsection is subject to the limitations stated in on abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations  a structure that is nonconforming in any respect or a structure that is used in a nonconforming manner may be reconstructed or replaced if partially or totally destroyed subject to the following restrictions 1 the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use may not be increased except that a larger singlefamily residential structure may be constructed in place of a smaller one and a larger manufactured home intended for residential use may replace a smaller one 2 the reconstructed building may not be more nonconforming with respect to dimensional restrictions such as yard requirements height limitations or density requirements and such dimensional nonconformities must be eliminated if that can reasonably be accomplished without unduly burdening the reconstruction process or limiting the right to continue the nonconforming use of such building 3 the reconstructed building may not enclose areas that were previously unenclosed even though those areas were used in connection with the nonconforming activity an area is unenclosed unless at least 75% or more of the perimeter area is marked by a permanently constructed wall or fence 4 except for singlefamily residential structures including manufactured homes if the estimated cost of the reconstruction work exceeds 10% of the appraised value of the structure the work may be done only after authorization by the board of adjustment upon request of the owner the board of adjustment shall grant such authorization if it finds that the work will be done in accordance with this subsection and that the reconstructed building will not make the property more incompatible with the surrounding property that it was before the destruction occurred  4 article 9 nonconforming situations change in kind of nonconforming use  a nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use thereafter the property may not revert to a nonconforming use  a nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use only if authorized by the board of adjustment the board of adjustment shall grant such authorization if it finds that the proposed use will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the permit is applied for if a nonconforming use is changed to any use other than a conforming use abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations  when a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes except as provided in subsection  of this section  the board of adjustment may authorize a nonconforming use that has been discontinued for more than 180 consecutive days to be reinstated if it finds that the nonconforming use has been discontinued for less than two 2 years and the discontinuance resulted from factors that for all practical purposes were beyond the control of the person maintaining the nonconforming use  for purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this subsection all of the buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole for example the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building or one space in a nonconforming manufactured home park for 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building or manufactured home park as a whole is continuously maintained but if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter and so if a manufactured home is used as a nonconforming use on a residential lot where a conforming residential structure also is located removal of that manufactured home for 180 days terminates the right to replace it  5 article 9 nonconforming situations  when a structure or operation made nonconforming by this vacated or discontinued at the effective date of this the 180day period for purposes of this subsection begins at the effective date of the 6 completion of nonconforming projects  all nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least 180 days before the effective date of this well as all nonconforming projects that are at least twenty five percent 25% completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date of this be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits so long as these permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired if a development is designed to be completed in stages this subsection shall apply only to the particular phase under construction  except as provided in subsection  and except to the extent that a developer has a vested right as set forth in all work on any nonconforming project shall cease on the effective date of this all permits previously issued for work on nonconforming projects shall be revoked unless the developer requests an appeal to the board of adjustment to overturn the zoning administrators decision an appeal shall stay any revocation the zoning administrator shall issue such a permit if heshe finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changes his position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the it existed before the effective date of this thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete his project as proposed in considering whether these findings may be made the zoning administrator shall be guided by the following as well as other relevant considerations 1 all expenditures made to obtain or pursuant to a building zoning sign or special or conditional use permit that was validly issued and that remains unrevoked shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this effective 2 except as provided in subdivision 1 no expenditures made more than 180 days before the effective date of this be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this effective an expenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure  6 article 9 nonconforming situations 3 to the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures for example a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditures to acquire a potential development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new classification as it was under the old 4 to the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of a conforming project a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made such expenditures 5 a person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if the person i had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the the proposed development site which could not be attributed to him or ii should have known of the proposed change in the even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting a development site the zoning administrator may still find that he acted in good faith if he did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the requirements of the proposed zoning administrator may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to avoid requirements of the proposed heshe determines that i at the time the expenditures were made it was not clear that the proposed prohibit the intended development and ii the developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures 7 in deciding whether a permit should be issued under this section the zoning administrator shall not be limited to either denying a permit altogether or issuing a permit to complete the project or phases sections or stages thereof as originally proposed or approved upon proper submission of plans by the applicant the zoning administrator may also issue a permit authorizing a development that is less nonconforming than the project as originally proposed or approved but that still does not comply with all the provisions of the the project nonconforming the zoning administrator shall not allow the nonconforming project to be constructed or completed in a fashion that is larger or more extensive than is necessary to allow the developer to recoup and obtain a reasonable rate of return on the expenditures he has made in connection with that nonconforming project  7 article 9 nonconforming situations  when it appears from the developers plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in phases stages segments or other discrete units the developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the developer can make the showing required under subsection  and obtain permits in addition to the matters and subject to the guidelines set forth in subdivisions 1 the zoning administrator shall in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project consider the following in addition to other relevant factors 1 whether any plans prepared or approved regarding incompleted phases constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying architectural or engineering work 2 whether any improvements such as streets or utilities have been installed in phases not yet completed 3 whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed in such a manner or location or on such a scale in anticipation of connection to or interrelationship with approved but incompleted phases that the investment in such utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if such approved but incompleted phases are constructed in conformity with existing regulations 4 the zoning administrator shall not consider any application for the permit authorized by subsection  that is submitted more than sixty 60 days after the effective date of this zoning administrator may waive this requirement for good cause shown but in no case may it extend the application deadline beyond one year authorization of nonconforming projects whenever an amendment to this effective after an application for a development permit is submitted but before the permit is issued and the effect of the amendment is to render the proposed development nonconforming in some respect then the applicant may choose to proceed with the development under the previous requirements or under the amended requirements  8 article 9 nonconforming situations nonconforming signs  subject to the remaining restrictions of this section nonconforming signs that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this article may be continued  no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming sign without limiting the generality of the foregoing no nonconforming sign may be enlarged or altered in such a manner as to aggravate the nonconforming condition  nor may illumination be added to any nonconforming sign  a nonconforming sign may not be moved or replaced except to bring the sign into complete conformity with this article  if a nonconforming sign is destroyed by natural causes it may not thereafter be repaired reconstructed or replaced except in conformity with all the provisions of this ordinance and the remnants of the former sign structure shall be cleared from the land for purposes of this section a nonconforming sign is destroyed if damaged to an extent that the cost of repairing the sign to its former stature or replacing it with an equivalent sign equals or exceeds the value tax value if listed for tax purposes of the sign damaged  the message of a nonconforming sign may be changed so long as this does not create any new nonconformity for example by creating an offpremises sign under circumstances where such a sign would not be allowed  subject to other provisions of this section nonconforming signs may be repaired and renovated so long as the cost of such work does not exceed within any 12month period
