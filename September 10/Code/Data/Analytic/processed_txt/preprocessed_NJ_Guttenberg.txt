#00209  1 the mayor and council of the town of guttenberg hereby find there has been a significant breakdown in the supervision normally provided by certain parents and guidance for juveniles under 17 years of age resulting in juveniles being involved in a wide range of unacceptable behavior including vandalism noisy and rowdy behavior breaking and entering public drinking and littering and harassment of residents the mayor and council further find that the offensive activities of the juveniles are not easily controlled by existing laws and ordinances because the activities are easily concealed whenever police officers are present and the establishment of reasonable curfew regulations will enable the community to better control the free and unobstructed access to the streets and public places by the majority of residents and will enable the police to act reasonably and fairly to prevent the violation of laws and ordinances by juveniles the mayor and council further find and have determined that a curfew meets a very real local need and that curfew ordinances in other communities have been a significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency a curfew in guttenberg is particularly appropriate in view of the high density of population in guttenberg and the mixed use of residential and commercial areas throughout the town the regulation of juveniles is an attempt to minimize danger to the juveniles and the  3123 guttenberg code  3131  community during the danger hours for nocturnal crime and mischief which could be accentuated because of the juveniles immaturity

with the statutory dictates of njsa d23 et seq and created a board of adjustment pursuant to the dictates of njsa d69 et seq  and the new jersey legislative branch has amended the municipal land use law known as njsa d1 et seq so as to allow municipalities with populations less than 10000 residents the option of creating a planning board and vesting the same powers of the board of adjustment in
