provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material b findings

statistics obtained from the us department of health and human services centers for disease control and prevention the village board finds that 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary and unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this chapter as adult theaters and adult cabarets engage in higher incidences of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented business especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purposes of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids acquired immunodeficiency syndrome caused by the hiv virus in the united states 600 in 1982  2200 in 198 4600 in 1984  8555 in 198 and 253448  8 the state of wisconsin division of health indicated that on  there was 96 cases of aids reported in the state including 54 cases that resulted in death and that a tenfold increase in reported cases was expected between 1986 and 1991  1601 slinger code  1601  9 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 198 and 45200  10 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 11 in his report of  the surgeon general of the united states has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 12 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 13 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 14 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adultoriented films 15 crime statistics show that all types of crimes especially sexrelated crimes occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented business are located 16 studies of the relationship between sexually oriented business and neighborhood property values have found a negative impact on both residential and commercial property values 17 there is an increase in the potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct 18 the consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises of sexually oriented businesses exacerbated the deleterious secondary effects of such businesses on the community in fact the supreme court has gone so far as to assert that common sense indicates that any form of nudity coupled with alcohol begets undesirable behavior bens bar 2003 wl 132 19 citations omitted 19 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect the

appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the village it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22 in the prevention of the spread of communicable

39816 general provisions  39816  sex offenders residency restrictions general references zoning  see ch 550  4010 preamble whereas the village board of the village of slinger washington county wisconsin deems it a priority to act in the interest of public safety within our community particularly in the interest of our children and whereas according to the us department of justice there are a record number of convicted sex offenders living in our communities186  and whereas all convicted child sex offenders have proven themselves to be dangerous187  and whereas research in this area has established sex offenders are rearrested for sex crimes four times more frequently than nonsex offenders188  and whereas the reduction of crime and criminal recidivism are inextricably linked to public safety within our community  and whereas the risks posed by sex offenders against children are nationally recognized in such landmark legislation as the 1994 jacob wetterling crimes against children and sexually violent offender registration act  1996 megans laws  and the 2006 adam walsh child protection and safety act  and these risks are also recognized by legislation in every state in the united states of america including wisconsin  and reasons for the appeal the village clerk shall schedule the appeal for consideration by the village board at a regular meeting as soon as reasonably practicable under the circumstances and shall notify the user of the time date and place of such meeting in writing by regular mail deposited in the mail no later than at least three days before the date of such meeting upon review of such appeal the village board may change such decision action or determination upon just and reasonable cause shown 186 note sex offender management

offenders released from prison in 1994  39816 slinger code  4010  whereas the village board finds that the data concerning child sex offenders is horrific and demonstrates the need for action including the following189  sex crimes are unfortunately fairly common in the united states  it is estimated that one in every five girls and one in every seven boys are sexually abused by the time they reach adulthood  children are particularly vulnerable approximately 67% of all victims of reported sexual assaults are under the age of 18 and more than half of these victims are under the age of 12  most sexual offenses are committed by someone the victim knows    or acquaintance  no single factor or combination of factors can fully explain why someone offends sexually though some factors may combine to increase peoples tendency to offend these factors are  physiological sociocultural developmental and situationalcircumstantial eg having easy access to victims   about 12% to 24% of sex offenders will reoffend whereas the village board also finds these statistics of the us department of justice to be shocking and a call to action190  approximately 18 million adolescents in the united states have been victims of sexual assault  an estimated 60% of perpetrators of sexual abuse are known to the child but are not family members eg family friends babysitters child care providers neighbors whereas the creation of sex offender residency restrictions and safety zones by municipal ordinance around locations where children regularly congregate is a reasonable step toward protecting our children and deterring recidivism by reducing the opportunity for new offenses within our community  and whereas the village board has reviewed many studies and reports concerning recidivism of sex offenders and the effectiveness of sex offender residency restrictions191 and has been fully advised in the matter  and 189 note center for sex offender management csom statistics csom is a collaborative effort of the us department of justice office of justice programs the national institute of corrections the state justice institute and the american probation and parole association and these quoted statistics are from its fact sheet what you need to know about sex offenders 190 note us department of justice national sex offender public website facts and statistics 191 note these include but are not limited to recidivism of sex offenders released from prison in 199 us department of justice office of justice programs copyright november 2003  the final report of the commission to improve community safety and sex offender accountability of the state of maine dated january 2004  sex offender recidivism prediction correctional service of canada dated   recidivism  4010 general provisions  4010  whereas the literature on the subject includes some studies that support the practice of imposing sex offender residency restrictions and others that are critical of the practice  and whereas the village board finds it to be significant that some of the key studies that have concluded that sex offender residency restrictions have limited effectiveness have added significant qualifications to that conclusion  eg in an evaluation of sex offender residency restrictions in michigan and missouri huebner et al 2013 the authors generally do not support sex offender residency restrictions but nevertheless find that following adoption of sex offender residency restrictions the rate of recidivism for technical violations significantly decreased for missouri sex offenders   id at 9 and the number of sex offense convictions did decline   in missouri id at 10  and whereas the village board recognizes the merits mentioned in some studies of individualized consideration of the risks and benefits of residency restrictions on an offenderbyoffender basis though this assessment of risks is not a perfect science and could give rise to equal protection or other enforcement concerns  and on the local level it is important to provide clear information to those who may want to locate in the village including a map of available residency locations  and the village board finds that this desire for uniformity and clarity outweighs the desire for individualized consideration at the village level in general  and whereas in review of the residency restrictions of communities throughout washington county and its environs the village board finds that many of such communities have an original domicile restriction which allows each community to take back its own while not adding an additional burden of more than its own sex offenders to its community  such burdens including neighborhood and citizen concerns and responses risks of recidivism and potential property value impacts192  and of sex offenders may 200 center for sex offender management  treating sex offenders wisconsin lawyer magazine october 1994  the impact of

are only one such impact stop it now a nonprofit organization devoted to sex offender research offers this advice to those concerned about sex offenders moving into a neighborhood among others create a family safety plan  attend notification meetings  notify the police of suspicious activity  and dont wait to take action for prevention at a minimum this heightened awareness and activity  4010 slinger code  4010  whereas if the village of slinger would not have an original domicile restriction the village would have open doors for nonresident sex offender residency when other communities have closed doors inviting a substantial increase in child sex offender placements with the related adverse impacts on the health safety and welfare of the village and its residents  and whereas the village board believes that for all but the most severe offenders this risk of adverse impact declines as time passes following the date of a designated offenders offense as the offender matures recovers and reintegrates with society over time  and if this results in the offender being removed from the state registration list the offender is thereby automatically removed from the village residency restrictions  but even if state registration is required once 10 years has passed since the date on which the person was released from prison or placed on parole probation extended supervision or other supervised release for the sex offense provided it is not a class a felony against a child the village board finds it is appropriate to remove the original domicile restriction and allow such reformed citizen to move into the village of slinger in compliance with this ordinance  and by opening this door the village board hopes that it is establishing a precedent for its surrounding communities to open their doors as well  and whereas the village board recognizes that it cannot eliminate all risk of child sex offender reoffense and it must balance all of the competing public policies but intends by these regulations to strike the legislative balance that is appropriate for the circumstances of the village of slinger  and whereas it is not the intent of this chapter to banish sex offenders from residing within the village of slinger and careful attention has been given to ensure that there are ample locations for sex offenders to reside within the village of slinger in compliance with the requirements of this chapter  4011 residency and safety restrictions for sex offenders the wisconsin statutes govern the punishment of individuals who commit sex crimes the wisconsin statutes also govern the release into the community of such individuals the village of slinger has no authority or intent to intervene in either area the village of slinger recognizes statutory residency restrictions and the limited exemptions enumerated in   wis stats for sex offenders released pursuant to  98008 wis stats  4012 purpose this chapter is a nonpunitive civil regulatory measure aimed at protecting the public health safety and welfare of the children and citizens of the village of slinger from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations close to their residences the village finds and declares that sex offenders who prey upon children are a serious threat to public safety burdens the families and neighbors where sex offenders are placed and collectively this burdens the village staff and resources for every designated offender placement  4010 general provisions  4012  and it is necessary for the village to enact reasonable measures to reduce the opportunity and minimize the risk of reoffense by protecting children where they congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law near schools and other places children frequent  4013 definitions as used in this chapter the following terms shall have the meanings indicated prohibited activity  distributing candy or other items to
