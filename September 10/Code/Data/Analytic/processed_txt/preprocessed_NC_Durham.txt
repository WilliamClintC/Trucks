assistance projects for which the city has developed project scopes and estimates of probable cost prior to  may be completed under the terms of the repealed by the enactment of this ordinance purpose and definitions a purpose this division establishes the conditions under which funds from the stormwater utility will be used for work on drainage system components located outside the cityowned drainage system or within cityowned rightsofway drainage system components located within cityowned rightsofway play an essential function in carrying stormwater and the public impact when such components malfunction is generally greater than when such components are located outside the rightsofway therefore the first priority use of stormwater utility funds is for maintenance of and improvements to drainage system components within cityowned rightsofway stormwater utility funds may also be used to fund drainage system construction improvement repair or maintenance on property outside of city rightsofway the city has an interest in helping to assure that components of the drainage system that have an impact on the overall system are maintained andor improved whether located inside or outside city rightsofway such components are generally those that carry in whole or in part runoff from publicly maintained streets the intent of this section is not to transfer responsibility or liability to the city for drainage system components on property not owned by the city that carry such runoff rather it is to establish criteria and priorities to be used when making available stormwater utility funds for work on drainage system components located outside of cityowned rightsofway no action or inaction of the city pursuant to this section shall impose upon the city its agents officers or employees any responsibility or liability of any kind past or future relating to any person or property no action by the city including but not limited to funding of work on drainage system components not owned by the city shall be considered as a taking or appropriation of or assumption of responsibility for any stream drain ditch or other drainage system feature that is outside cityowned property or rightofway city participation in work on drainage system components outside of the rightofway is limited to the extent to which funds are available for such purpose and

that do not require construction of scms because their impervious percentage is less than that described in the paragraph above must treat tss from stormwater runoff that is conveyed in nonvegetated conveyances such as stormwater pipes but excluding road and driveway crossings 2 overtreatment to address untreatable areas where treatment for tss is not reasonably practicable as determined by the department such as when impervious areas include offsite transportation improvements or small noncontiguous areas at the edge of a project additional reductions of tss may be required in treatable areas such as overtreatment in other project areas or treatment of offsite runon f calculations for nutrient loading and tss removal pollutant loading calculations shall be made using city stormwater

while striving to maintain the overall character of neighborhoods and commercial areas of durham development standards established in this based on durhams planning tiers as established in the comprehensive plan standards in this section are specific to each district and are above and beyond the general standards for all districts enumerated in design standards additional requirements for subdivisions separate standards are established to regulate residential and nonresidential development in each tier and for certain nonresidential districts this approach to district and tier development standards implements the comprehensive plan and has several public benefits a it allows for development that is more sensitive to the environment and allows for the preservation of open and natural areas b it promotes quality site layout and energyefficient development c it promotes affordable and lifecycle housing d it promotes development intensities that match existing and proposed infrastructure investments e it promotes infill development that is consistent in character and scale with established neighborhoods f it promotes compact land development that supports alternate transportation such as bicycling walking mass transit g it promotes marketbased development decisions while protecting shared public interests  flexible development tools by plan tier the
