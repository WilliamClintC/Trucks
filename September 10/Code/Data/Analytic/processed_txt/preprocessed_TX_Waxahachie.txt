discharges to the extent possible until such time as the reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided b upset in an action brought in federal court it is an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards that the noncompliance was caused by upset as defined in the following subsections of this section 1 for the purposes of this section upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user an upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation 2 an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection b3 below are met 3 a user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that a an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  b the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner

this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails c prohibited discharge standards a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 3353a1 of this article or the specific prohibitions in subsection 3353a2cr of this article if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city of waxahachie was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements note the references in subsection c should refer only to specific prohibitions actually listed in the ordinance also note that pursuant

if the oral report has been received within twentyfour 24 hours 4 a bypass is prohibited and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless 1 bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  2 there was no feasible alternative to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and 3 the user submitted notices as required under subsection d3 of this section b the director

methods findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city of waxahachie are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly floodcontrol projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this ordinance uses the following methods 1 restricts or prohibits uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 requires that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controls the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 controls filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will

volume of approved but unbuilt developments holding valid unexpired building permits at level of service c or above 5 effect of adequacy determination if the adequacy determination for roadways and intersections indicates that the proposed development would cause a reduction in the level of service for any roadway or intersection within the study area identified in subsection 31f1 herein that would cause the roadway to fall below the level of service required hereto the proposed development shall be denied unless the developer agrees to one of the following conditions a the deferral of building permits until the improvements necessary to upgrade the substandard facilities are constructed  b a reduction in the density or intensity of development  c the dedication or construction of facilities needed to achieve the level of service required herein  or d any combination of techniques identified herein that would ensure that development will not occur unless the levels of service
