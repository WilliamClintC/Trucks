buildings footnotes  9  editors note adopted  added new provisions to ch 5 of the art ii  521535 as other provisions existed within the art ii of ch 5 the provisions of 35 have been redesignated as art ix  52515265 at the editors discretion title this article shall be known as the city smokefree air ordinance  642003 finding and intent a the city board of commissioners does hereby find that 1 numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing secondhand smoke also known as environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers including heart disease stroke respiratory disease and lung cancer the national cancer institute determined in 1999 monograph #10 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of 65000 americans annually 2 the public health services national toxicology program has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen us dhhs 200 citing cal epa 1997 3 secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired respiratory function including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma respiratory infections sudden infant death syndrome developmental abnormalities and cancer 4 the americans with disabilities act which requires that disabled persons have access to public places and workplaces deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability 5 the us surgeon general has determined that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce but does not eliminate the exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke the environmental protection agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels by high rates of ventilation air cleaners which are only capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke 6 a significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace employees who work in smokefilled offices suffer a 25 to 50 percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function 7 smokefilled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease lower productivity higher cleaning and maintenance costs increased health insurance rates and increased liability claims for disease related to exposure to secondhand smoke b accordingly the city board of commissioners finds and declares that the purposes of this article are 1 to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in all public facilities in the city  and 2 to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smokefree air and to recognize that the need to breathe smokefree air shall have priority over the desire to smoke

of fact purpose and objectives statutory authorization of the constitution of the state of georgia and ocga  36120a have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the board of commissioners of the city of brunswick georgia does ordain as follows 111 962006   12202017 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of brunswick georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities 112 962006   12202017 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  b restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  c control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion  and d prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  e control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters 113 962006   12202017 objectives the objectives of this chapter are a to protect human life and health  b to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  c to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  d to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  e to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  f to minimize prolonged business interruptions and  g to insure that

article i  general provisions findings of fact it is hereby determined that a land development projects and associated changes in the landscape alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition  b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants  and c stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from existing and future development sites therefore the

condition along this section of us 17 a parkway is a wide scenic road planted with trees this corridor is deemed by the city commission to be important because so many visitors get their first impression of brunswick while driving along us 17 the scenic vistas of the marsh are inherently and economically valuable to the public and visual clutter impedes aesthetically and economically

on the communitys transportation network by development is an important dimension of assessing the overall impacts of development proposals all development generates traffic and it may generate enough traffic to create congestion and thus require the community to invest more capital funds into the transportation network in the form of new roads traffic signals and intersection improvements traffic congestion results in a number of problems including economic costs due to delayed travel times air pollution and accidents a traffic impact analysis is a mechanism for the city to foresee the demands a development proposal will place on the transportation network exh a 3212018 objectives the city finds that requiring a traffic impact analysis for proposed developments that meet certain thresholds will help to achieve the following objectives a forecast additional traffic associated with new development based on accepted practices b determine the improvements that are necessary to accommodate the new development c allow the city to assess the impacts that a proposed development may have and assist the city in making decisions regarding development proposals d help to ensure safe and reasonable traffic conditions on streets after the development is complete e reduce the negative impacts created by developments by helping to ensure that the transportation network can accommodate the development f protect the substantial public investment in the street system g provide information relevant to citywide comprehensive planning transportation planning transit planning and the provision of programs and facilities for traffic safety road improvements transportation demand management pedestrian access and other transportation system considerations exh a 3212018 definitions

street or highway level of service relates to such factors as highway width number of lanes percentage of trucks total traffic volume turning movements lateral clearances grades sight distance capacity in relation to volume travel speed and other factors which affect the quality of flow level of service is typically summarized by letter grades described as follows level a is a condition

volumes where speed and maneuvering are restricted to a limited degree by the amount of traffic level d is a condition with heavy traffic operating at tolerable speeds although temporary slowdowns in flow may occur level e is a condition of very heavy flow and relatively low speeds under level e the traffic is unstable and short stoppage may occur level f is a condition of extremely heavy flow

standards in a landmark zoning decision the supreme court of georgia wrote as the individuals right to the unfettered use of his property confronts the police power under which zoning is done the balance the law strikes is that a zoning classification may only be justified if it bears a substantial relation to the public health safety morality or general welfare lacking such justification the zoning may be set aside as arbitrary or unreasonable   as these critical interests are balanced if the zoning regulation results in relatively little gain or benefit to the public while inflicting serious injury or loss on the owner such regulation is confiscatory and void   moreover we specifically rule that for such unlawful confiscation to occur requiring that the zoning be voided it is not necessary that the property be totally useless for the purposes classified   it suffices to void it that the damage to the owner is significant and is not justified by the benefit to the public barrett v hamby 235 ga 262 265  219 se2d 399 1975 the foregoing means that a zoning classification to be valid must be supported by reasons related to the public health safety morality or general welfare specific criteria for zoning decisions do not exist but the reasons upon which such decisions are based must be identifiable and articulable in order to avoid the fatal defect of arbitrariness in a later decision the court suggested a number of factors which should be considered in determining the validity of a zoning classification the validity of each zoning ordinance must be determined on the facts applicable to the particular case but certain general lines of inquiry have been regarded as relevant to wit 1 existing uses and zoning of nearby property  2 the extent to which property values are diminished by the particular zoning restrictions  3 the extent to which the destruction of property values of the plaintiffs promotes the health safety morals or general welfare of the public  4 the relative gain to the public as compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual property owner  5 the suitability of the subject property for the zoned purposes  and 6 the length of time the property has been vacant as zoned considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the property guhl v holcomb bridge road corp 238 ga 322 323  232 se2d 830 1977 the current georgia statutory law ocga  36665b expressly mandates that each local government exercising zoning power establish and consider such factors in the form of substantive standards for zoning decisions that subsection provides each local government shall adopt standards governing the exercise of the zoning power and such standards may include any factors which the local government finds relevant in balancing the interest in promoting the public health safety morality or general welfare against the right to the unrestricted use of property such standards shall be printed and copies thereof shall be available for distribution to the general public in keeping with the foregoing statutory requirement the city of brunswick has adopted the following substantive standards to govern its zoning decisions a a proposed zoning classification or conditional use request should be compatible with existing uses and zoning of adjacent and nearby property and spot zoning should almost always be rejected relevant questions 1 would the proposed rezoning create an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts 2 is the proposed rezoning a logical extension of a zoning boundary which would improve the pattern of uses in the general area b a proposed zoning classification should not destabilize the surrounding neighborhood relevant questions 1 is the proposed zoning classification one which would promote integrity of the neighborhood and preserve its general character 2 would the proposed rezoning precipitate similar rezoning requests which would generate or accelerate adverse land use changes in the neighborhood c a proposed zoning classification should maximize the economic value of the subject property without depreciating the value of adjacent and nearby property relevant questions 1 to what extent does the existing zoning classification depress the value of the subject property 2 to what extent would the proposed zoning classification result in appreciation of the value of the property 3 what effect does the existing zoning classification have on the values of adjacent and nearby property 4 what effect would the proposed zoning classification have on the values of adjacent and nearby property d a proposed zoning classification should not have an adverse effect on traffic flow traffic safety or population density relevant questions 1 is there adequate public or private parking for the proposed use and other uses permitted within the classification 2 would such uses create any problem of traffic congestion in the area 3 would such uses create any traffic safety problem with regard to ingress and egress visibility or otherwise 4 would such uses necessitate changes in streets or sidewalks or traffic signage or signalization 5 would such uses contribute to an undesirable level of population density 6 would such uses substantially conflict with existing density patterns in the neighborhood e a proposed zoning classification should not have adverse environmental impact relevant questions 1 would the proposed use or other uses permitted within the classification create noise dust smoke or odors 2 would such uses affect air quality or water quality and quantity 3 would such uses create problems with drainage or soil erosion and sedimentation 4 would such uses aggravate problems with flood damage control 5 would such uses aggravate waste disposal problems f a proposed zoning classification should not have adverse aesthetic effects relevant questions 1 would the proposed rezoning lead to removal of existing vegetation 2 would the proposed use incorporate new planting 3 would the proposed use necessitate unattractive structures or result in removal or alteration of historic structures 4 would the proposed use be visually compatible with the surrounding neighborhood 5 would the proposed use include machinery or work visible from the street or neighboring property 6 would the proposed use be adequately separated from conflicting uses by an appropriate buffer g a rezoning should not result in costs to the public disproportionate to tax revenues generated by the proposed use relevant questions 1 would the rezoning increase the cost of government in providing public utilities schools streets police and fire protection etc 2 what additional public facilities would be required 3 to what extent would such increased costs be offset by increased tax revenues h the subject property should be suitable for the zoned purposes relevant questions 1 is the property suitable for uses within the existing zoning classification 2 has the property been vacant as zoned and if so for what period or periods of time 3 are there substantial reasons why the property cannot be economically used in accordance with existing zoning 4 would the proposed rezoning benefit the general public in any way 5 would the proposed rezoning conform to or diverge from the comprehensive land use plan    it is obvious that the foregoing standards are very general not at all specific and that the public and private interests cannot be balanced with mathematical certainty in a zoning decision moreover particular zoning issues which may arise considered in context may suggest concerns in addition to the foregoing standards and further questions which will need to be addressed by the commission it can only be said that any zoning decision to be lawful must be based on a relative gain to the public as compared to the hardship imposed upon private parties such decisions must never be based simply upon the numbers of supporters or opponents or other political factors without consideration of the standards hearing policies the georgia statutory law ocga  36665a provides local governments shall
