35027 water sports  35027  that such practical difficulty or undue hardship exists may permit the property owner or developer to contribute to a trust fund administered by the borough of south river in lieu of providing onsite parking in accordance with borough of south river requirements this shall be known and is hereby established as the payment in exchange for parking pep program and the contribution fee shall be known as the pep contribution 2 purpose and council findings a the borough desires to have sufficient and conveniently located parking to serve all residents and businesses in the vicinity of the main street corridor b the borough desires that onsite parking requirements not be an inhibitor to economic development or the revitalization of existing properties and buildings c the borough recognizes that many parcels in the vicinity of the main street corridor are narrow or irregular in shape and contain existing buildings or pavement which cover most of the lot area of the property d the borough recognizes that some irregular parcels are unlikely to be developed or redeveloped because of the space requirements for onsite parking including access aisles street connections and driveways and such properties could become more practical for redevelopment if parking could be relocated off of these sites and into one or more central parking facilities e development applications which do not have sufficient onsite parking have historically relied on shared parking arrangements which have created scattered parking lots throughout the area or have relied on the purchase of a finite number of parking permits from the municipal parking utility which will one day reach maximum capacity f the borough has a number of municipal parking areas which are in need of capital improvement reorganization and consideration for expansion g the capital costs of constructing new parking facilities including land acquisition will represent a substantial financial cost to the borough in the future h in lieu of requiring the construction of parking spaces on site both developers and the borough would benefit from a mechanism wherein required parking spaces could in appropriate locations be provided via a contribution to a capital fund and wherein such contributions would be  35027 south river code  35027  combined to pay the costs of constructing municipal parking facilities under the coordination of the borough of south river i construction of additional offstreet parking utilities by the borough of south river parking utility will serve new

findings 1 the borough recognizes that the federal government fta and fcc regulates wireless communications and issues licenses for wireless communications and that the fcc requires the license holders to provide coverage within the areas so licensed 2 the fta expressly preserves the zoning authority of the borough to regulate the placement construction and modification of personal wireless service facilities subject to the provisions noted at c7b of the federal telecommunications act of  3 the fta does not abrogate local zoning authority in favor of the commercial desire to offer optimal service to all current and potential customers and the providers of the personal wireless services must bear the burden of proving that any proposed service facility is the least intrusive means of filling a significant gap in wireless communications services in the area 4 it is in the public interest to minimize the number of wireless communications towers within the borough and to preserve the nature and character of the local community 5 it is in the public interest that to the extent possible any new facilities for wireless communications be placed on existing towers without the construction of new towers 6 it is in the public interest that wireless communications carriers colocate their facilities with each other 7 the overall objective of this section is to allow the provision of wireless communications services while at the same time limiting the number of antennas and supporting towers to the fewest possible and only in those locations which do not negatively impact 193 editors note see 47 usc  332c7b  35028 water sports  35029  the prevailing character of the borough and the quality of life enjoyed by the residents d specific goals 1 to minimize the total
