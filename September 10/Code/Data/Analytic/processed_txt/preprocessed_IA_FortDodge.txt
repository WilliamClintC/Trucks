is intended to provide flexible land use and design regulations use of performance criteria so that smalltolarge scale neighborhoods or portions thereof may be developed with a variety of residential types and nonresidential uses may contain both individual building sites and common property which are planned and developed as a unit such a planned development is to be designed and organized so as to be capable of satisfactory use and operation as a separate entity without necessarily needing the participation of other building sites or other common property in order to function as a neighborhood planned development specifically encourages innovations so that the growing demands of housing may be met by greater variety in type design and siting of dwellings and by the conservation and more efficient use of land this district recognizes that the standard zoning function use and bulk and the subdivision function platting and design are appropriate for the regulation of land use

provisions of this section are intended to regulate and guide the location of new communication towers antennas and related accessory structures it is the desire of the city of fort dodge to encourage the development of an aesthetically pleasing local environment it is also the intent of the city to encourage the expansion of wireless technology as it provides a valuable service to city residents and businesses it is not the citys goal to unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services  and to not have the effect of prohibiting either directly or indirectly the provisions of personal wireless services it is the citys goal to encourage wireless providers to construct new facilities disguised of camouflage design as defined in this is the intent of these regulations to achieve the following objectives 1 to minimize the adverse visual effects of communication structures design siting locating and screening  2 to locate and engineer communications
