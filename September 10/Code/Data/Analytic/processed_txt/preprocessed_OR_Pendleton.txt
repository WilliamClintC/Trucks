example a step 1 determine the location of the sign note to achieve the maximum projection the sign should be located in the middle of the business frontage step 2 calculate the allowable projection by measuring in feet the distance from the sign location to the nearest corner of the business which may be the building and multiplying it by 3 in the diagram above it would be 20 x 3   60 or 5 feet note this projection is equal to the maximum allowable projection over the public right of way if the building was set back from the property line and the building business frontage is greater than 40 feet a larger projection would be permissible  2775  2226 step 3 determine the upper height of the sign in this example assume the maximum height is available as shown but beware it could be less thus a 10foot vertical dimension the difference between the upper and lower limits is available for a sign step 4 calculate the allowable sign face area by multiplying the projection dimension step 2 and the vertical dimension step 3 in this example it would be 10 x 5   50 square feet example b  how to calculate the area of a wall sign use diagram shown with example a step 1 calculate the allowable

franchise to micro cable communications corp doing business as pendleton cable company its successors and assigns to build construct operate and maintain a cable television system in the city of pendleton umatilla county oregon and setting forth conditions accompanying the granting of this franchise  establishing an effective date of the first day of november 1984  and repealing ordinances no 2871 and 3090 city of pendleton ordains as follows this be known and may be cited as the pendleton cable company franchise  this passed after a full open and public hearing upon prior notice and opportunity of all interested parties to be heard and upon careful consideration of micro cable communications corp doing business as pendleton cable companys qualifications including its legal character financial and technical qualifications and the adequacy and feasibility of its construction arrangements definitions for the purpose of this when not inconsistent with the context words used herein in the present tense include the future  words in plural include the singular and vice versa the word shall is always mandatory the captions supplied herein for each section are for convenience only said captions have no force of law are not part of the section and are not to be used in construing the language of the section the following terms and phrases as used herein shall be given the meaning set forth below amplifiers are devices used to boost or strengthen the electronic signal which is being transmitted cable to subscribers television sets they are generally spaced at certain intervals along the cable to rebuild the strength of the signal which becomes weakened as it travels cable examples of often used amplifiers are a bridge amplifiers or bridgers these are connected to the main trunk cable and generally used as a bridge to take the signal off the trunk line and direct it into the feeder or distribution cables branching off the trunk cable to subscribers residences  b cascade amplifiers these amplifiers are connected directly to the trunk cable in a series they are spaced at certain optimum intervals to repeatedly strengthen the television signal as it travels along the cable  and c line extender amplifier or distribution amplifier as the terms imply such amplifiers are used in the feeder or distribution system to give one final boost to the television signal before it reaches the subscribers receiver attenuation this is the term used to describe the weakening in the strength of the television signal as it passes cable system for example as the signal passes part of the system such as the coaxial cable amplifiers or taps it meets resistance and loses a measurable part of its strength this is known as attenuation bandwidth this term describes the electromagnetic frequency spectrum for a particular use or capacity for example a single television channel has a designated bandwidth of 6 megahertz 6 million cycles per second a cable system with a bandwidth capacity of 300 megahertz mhz would seemingly carry 50 channels 300 mhz divided by 6 mhz per channel but in reality such a system usually carries approximately 35 channels because of spacing between channels broadband is a companion term to bandwidth broadband is generally used to describe a system or equipment with a wide bandwidth a modern broadband system today has the capacity to carry as much as 440 mhz of the electromagnetic frequency spectrum on a single cable and some systems proposed for large metropolitan areas may have several cables with this capacity cable services this is a general term which describes the various programming and other offerings to subscribers by cable companies below is a description of some of the cable services currently offered on cable systems a basic services this is the term used to describe certain cable services provided for a monthly subscription charge this service shall include the carriage of broadcast signals and fcc mandated nonbroadcast services it encompasses programming not considered as ancillary or auxiliary services which include but are not limited to advertising leased channels and programming supplied on a per program or event basis if any  3311docx  28 b pay or premium services these services are offered to the subscriber for a per month or per view charge in addition to the regular monthly basic service charge 1 1129 c local origination services this cable service is offered by the cable company which maintains sole control of the content of the programming the company may have a studio at its headend or the local operator may go to a site such as a city hall school or the location of a special event to do the program with mobile equipment this service should not be confused with public access programming which is controlled by the general public or a public agency rather than by the cable company d public access services these services are carried on channel space made available to the general public local governments educational or other public institutions for their programming this city requires such services franchise negotiation or renewal process cable systems with at least twenty channel capacity shall set aside a minimum of ten 10% percent of its channels for public access programming e leased channel services these are channels leased by the cable company to persons or organizations for their use for a fee cable systems with at least twenty 20 channel capacity shall set aside a minimum of ten 10% percent of its channels for lease by other persons on a nondiscriminatory basis provided however eighty 80% percent of that channel or channels can be programmed by lessee a typical lease channel service is professional sports programming in the home town state or region of a team f interactive services these services are available only where the cable system has a twoway or bidirectional capability however the telephone system can be used in conjunction with the cable services to create a type of twoway service the following are examples of current interactive services 1 pay per view services with this service the subscriber has the ability to order the viewing of a certain event such as a first run movie or major sporting event as opposed to monthly pay services such as hbo which offer preselected programming at scheduled times 2 alarm system services these are fire police medical alert or other alarm services generally monitored at a central location for residences or businesses 3 teleservices these may be home shopping banking information gathering or other transactional services which allow the subscriber to order information gathering or other transactional services which allow the subscriber to order information goods or services from home there are several kinds of teleservices which involve varying degrees of control by the subscriber whether by electronic keyboard or decoder teletext or by access to a central computer use of home terminals telephone lines or some other means of access videotex 4 institutional services these services are usually an interactive loop tying together private businesses or public institutions to allow television communication with branch offices or agencies there are several applications of these services such as teleconferencing training programs and interagency communications such as automated library circulation systems and discrete police communications however by interconnecting institutional service loops with the residential subscriber system at the headend it is possible to deliver institutional programming to the residential subscriber as well 5 utility related services examples include utility meter reading and monitoring and controlling of utility operations centralized traffic signal control override capability to facilitate emergency vehicle travel for fires police or other emergencies cable terminology in addition to the types of amplifiers described above a cable television distribution system contains several types of equipment and cables which make up the system some of the more commonly referred to components are as follows a trunk cable the major distribution cable of the system from which emanate the service branches of the system the trunk cable is either lashed to supporting wires called strand on utility poles leased from the local telephone or power company or it is placed underground in conduit or directly buried in generally the same location as underground telephone and power lines cable companies like the telephone industry have begun to use fiber optic cable as an alternative when feasible to underground coaxial cable 1 coaxial cable such cable is called coaxial because it consists of two conductors one inside the other and having a common axle the inner wire is generally copper or coppersheathed aluminum surrounding this inner wire is a polyethylene or plastic insulating foam layer which is encased by a jacket of seamless aluminum or braided copper wire covered by a durable plastic sheathing an electromagnetic field is set up between the inner wire and the surrounding jacket which retains the signals within it thus the cable can carry a large number of signals with a minimum of leakage  3311docx  38 2 fiberoptic cable this alternative to coaxial cable consists of very thin glass fibers which transmit light signals with very little distortion and attenuation these light signals can carry information process called modulation which ends up as television signals the reduction in cable size and signal loss gives fiber optic cable a potential channel capacity greatly in excess of conventional coaxial cable 1 1129 b feeder or distribution cables these are the intermediate cable lines generally running along neighborhood streets which provide the connection between the main trunk cable and the final house lines that lead into a subscribers residence usually a bridger amplifier feeds the signal to these lines c drop cable or lines these are the individual residence cables connected to the feeder lines by a device called a tap or drop they provide the signal to the subscribers television set channel channel capacity a channel is a single path or section of the electromagnetic spectrum with a fcc assigned bandwidth of 6 mhz it carries a television signal which is in turn composed of an audio voice signal and a video visual signal channel capacity is a measurement of the maximum number of 6 mhz channels which can be simultaneously carried on a cable television system a cable system with a 35 channel capacity could not carry more channels without an upgrading or redesign of the system which often will require a new system to be built however some existing systems have a larger capacity than there are actual channels activated and the cable operator could increase the number of channels used without a complete rebuild of the system character generator a character generator is a video source for the purpose of providing data or characters generated for the use of public access information city is the city of pendleton an oregon municipal corporation city council is the city council of the city of pendleton city manager shall mean the city manager of the city of pendleton or his authorized representative converter is a device used to change the frequency of a signal the most familiar converter is the settop converter this changes the signals sent cable to meet the preselected channels on the subscribers television set in order that it can receive more channels of programming so called cableready television sets have a oneway converter function built into them and can receive many channels of programming some over 100 without the need for a settop converter however since modern settop converters have other functions such as being twoway and addressable a settop converter may be necessary to use all available cable services in some systems even if the subscribers television set is cable ready earth station this term describes a facility which contains one or more antennas and associated electronic equipment to receive signals from satellites the typical earth station antenna is dishshaped and is pointed at a satellite positioned in a geostationary orbit above the earth geostationary means that it stays in the same position above a certain part of the earth such satellites transmit signals to earth stations in the wide geographical area footprint it covers federal communications commission or fcc is the present federal agency of that name as constituted by the communications act of 193 or any successor agency created by the united states of congress grantee is micro cable communications corp doing business as pendleton cable company a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of oregon and it is the grantee of rights under this franchise gross monthly service revenue shall include only payments made by subscribers for monthly service of said system and excluded from the aforesaid shall be refunds or charges made on amounts received by the grantee for installations converter rental in subscribers homes offices or businesses or for any other act or service headend  hub the headend is the main electronic control center of a cable system it is usually located at or near the earth station or other antenna site of the system incoming signals are received amplified filtered modulated and converted as necessary and retransmitted trunk feeder and distribution cable system to subscribers a hub is generally an operational center which is subservient to the headend but from which main spokes of the system originate when a system covers a wide area if the system is large enough and requires antennas at each hub to receive signals a headend and a hub may be virtually indistinguishable interconnection generally interconnection is the linking of different cable systems by connecting the headends of the systems in a manner that subscribers of adjacent or nearby systems can receive the same programming simultaneously the interconnection can be accomplished by microwave relay by coaxial cable by fiber optic cable or otherwise if the interconnection of facilities is done on a fairly large scale such as by satellite interconnection it then is referred to or is known as a network person is any individual firm partnership association corporation company or organization of any kind regular subscriber services shall include the carriage of broadcast signals and cc mandated nonbroadcast services but shall not include ancillary or auxiliary services which include but are not limited to advertising leased channels and programming supplied on a per program or per channel charge basis if any  3311docx  48 signals a general term for denoting an electromagnetic pulse communicated or transmitted in some manner variations of which are set forth below a broadcast signal it is the transmitting of electromagnetic signals air in a multidirectional pattern to receivers tuned to the specific frequency transmitted b cablecast signal this is generally programming which originates on a cable system such as local origination programming or public access programming 1 1129 c closed circuit or discrete signals these are signals transmitted to private subscribers directly without access in any manner by nonsubscribers d distant signals they are television signals which originate at a point too far away to be picked up by ordinary home reception equipment as well as signals outside a broadcasters license area e downstream  upstream signals a downstream signal is one that travels from the headend or studio to the subscribers residence an upstream signal is one that originates with the subscriber and travels to the headend studio or hub these designations have emerged with the reality of twoway or bidirectional systems grant of

no formal document that has enumerated the duties and responsibilities of the pendleton police department these duties and responsibilities have been deduced and taken from the oregon revised statutes and from common law traditions this lack of documentation has become an issue during the accreditation process for the pendleton police department  and whereas the city council finds that in order to ensure the successful completion of the accreditation process and the benefits that will accrue to the city it is appropriate to formally establish the existence of the pendleton police department and to enumerate the authority and responsibilities of the chief of police and the officers assigned to the department now therefore the city of pendleton ordains as follows purpose the city of pendleton

regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its residents  and whereas flood hazard areas of the city of pendleton and those lands within its urban growth boundary are subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare  and whereas these flood losses are caused by structures in flood hazard areas which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and whereas the city of pendleton has the primary responsibility for planning adoption and enforcement of land use regulations to accomplish proper floodplain management whereas it is appropriate to adopt this l  protect human life health and property  2 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities including but not limited to water purification and sewage treatment plants water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in flood hazard areas  3 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas  4 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  5 minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  6 minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce access and public service during times of flood  7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  8 ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions and  9 manage the alteration of flood hazard areas stream channels and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain whereas in order to accomplish its purpose this ordinance includes methods and provisions to 1 require that development that is vulnerable to floods including structures and facilities necessary for the general health safety and welfare of citizens be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  2 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  3 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion  4 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazards to other lands  5 preserve and restore natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which carry and store flood waters and  6 coordinate with and
