of illinois written by wallace rappe aia and edited by emily j harris many of these suggestions can apply to gilmer main street b oversized projecting and crowded signs compete with each other and produce confusion guide all signage decisions by remembering that the building itself is the best sign a sensitively rehabilitated wellmaintained building is the best advertisement for a businesss attention to detail and the quality of its products and services the following ground rules for signage will create positive images for individual businesses enhance the visual harmony of the shopping district and create an environment that attracts customers they may also dramatically cut signage costs 1 use flat signs in consistent places place signs on the buildings sign frieze which is the horizontal flat bank above the store windows original signs either on flat signboards or made of individual letters attached to the sign frieze were designed as an integral part of the building limit signs on other areas of the building 2 remove most projecting signs signs that hang over the sidewalk can be counterproductive to business because they often obscure individual buildings and interrupt the visual harmony of the street if projecting signs are to be used it is essential that they be small in scale and that they be coordinated with surrounding buildings and signs 3 limit the information on signs the shortest message on a sign has the most impact on pedestrians the name of the business and the street number are essential symbols or cutouts of familiar objects such as a pharmacists mortar and pestle can communicate a great deal of information without lettering at all 4 limit the size of the sign do not allow signs to conceal any of the buildings ornamental or architectural features adjust the size of the message to the distance that the shopper is from the store 5 use materials and colors that are compatible with the building and the streetscape the simple signs that were originally used on these buildings serve as the best example for new signs individual letters made of wood metal or some types of plastic that can be mounted directly on the frieze are always appropriate the number of colors used should be limited contrasting the lettering with its background is more important for legibility than using bright colors 6 use lighting judiciously while flashing signs or moving signs should be avoided lighted signs do identify businesses at night and can encourage evening windowshopping 7 preserve original and historic signs many older buildings display the names of their original owners on the upper part of the building or above doorways at the street level these should be preserved as part of the neighborhoods history and character app a
