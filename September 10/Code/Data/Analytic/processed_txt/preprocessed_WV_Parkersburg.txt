134811 avery historic district design guidelines aintroduction to guidelines 1these design guidelines are intended to provide assistance to property owners and contractors looking to do work on existing buildings or new construction within the avery historic district the guidelines are not to be considered unyielding rules but rather strong suggestions of how construction and repair work should be done in order to preserve the character of the historic architecture found in the district the avery historic district architectural review board arb will use these design guidelines as a resource guiding their decisions on whether or not to approve proposals it is important to note that the guidelines will not require property owners to make improvements to existing structures within the district the intent of the guidelines is to generate solutions that meet the needs of the property owner and protect the preservation interests of the avery historic district in cases of economic hardship the arb can modify guidelines to facilitate a positive outcome for both the applicant and the historic district bcharacteristics of the avery historic district 1in 198 the avery historic district was listed on the national register of historic places and is considered parkersburgs first suburb the district is a primarily residential neighborhood and is comprised of 12 distinct styles of historical architecture those styles are national style gothic revival italianate queen anne romanesque revival folk victorian classical revival colonial revival tudor revival craftsman international style and victorian eclectic these were all highly prevalent styles throughout the united states during the time period when the avery historic district was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries however there are very few true examples of these styles within the district instead most of the buildings in the district demonstrate the creative merging of elements comprising of multiple different architectural styles cdesign guidelines 1the design guidelines listed herein will apply uniformly to all the known architectural styles described above in the avery historic district except in cases where abiding by the guidelines would cause undue economic hardship aoriginal building materials and architectural details should not be covered up bhistoric materials and distinguishing features should not be removed attempt to preserve as much original architecture as possible calways try to repair rather than replace materials or distinguishing features whenever feasible dwhen it is necessary to replace attempt to replicate the original building material or distinguishing feature as closely as possible ein cases where replication of original materials or features is not feasible replacements should be congruent with the character of the structure fduring the restoration process look for clues as to the appearance of the original structure oftentimes original details have simply been covered up by later work for example original siding is frequently covered with vinyl siding on historic homes gwhen original details cannot be identified for reference rehabilitation efforts should be simplistic and focused on making sure the new work is in character with the existing structure hrestoration work should not make the building look older than the time period in which it was built if a determination of age cannot be made from the building look to surrounding buildings in the historic district for reference iin order to help preserve the historic character of the building the size of original doorways and windows should not be changed jany historic walls and fencing should be preserved or replaced inkind kthe architecture of the original roofline including features such as chimneys should not be altered in cases where replacing the roof in kind is not economically feasible the applicant should work with the arb to come to some reasonable accommodation for example instead of replacing an old slate roof with a new slate roof the applicant could replace it with a new shingle roof that is designed to look like slate levery effort should be made to retain and preserve original ornamentation as these details often help differentiate buildings in the historic district mexterior accessories such as light fixtures should be compatible with the overall character of the property nwhen doing brick work proper mortar joints should be utilized oif a structure was painted paint it again when doing restoration work the color of paint used should highlight the ornamentation of the building psurface cleaning should be done gently and should not utilize methods such as sandblasting ideally cleaning and paint removal should be avoided if possible qdo not assume that later additions to buildings are not historically significant because they are not original these additions may be significant as examples of their own architectural style rin cases of new construction design work and materials should be consistent with the architectural styles listed herein for examples of defining features that should be replicated by design and materials in new construction refer to the brief descriptions of each style in the avery historic district architectural reference guide snew construction should be sited to match surrounding setbacks  and it should be scaled in both size and height to match the existing buildings in the historic district tany additions should be considered as new construction ddemolitions 1demolitions should only be approved when the owner can prove that the building cannot be reused and that there is no economic benefit to be realized from salvaging all or part of the building 2demolitions should be approved in cases where there is an insignificant building or addition that does not contribute any historical value to the district  and where that demolition will not have any adverse impacts on the surrounding districts historic character passed 92419 article 1349 business districts 134901purpose of district classification 134902b1 neighborhood business district uses

president a resident whose primary occupancy is within the central business district and two 2 members of the downtown business community the planning director and director shall serve as nonvoting staff members concept to encourage desirable development the city of parkersburg shall adopt the downtown facade and design process provides for a casebycase review of design aspects of new development and redevelopment before a building permit is issued the review process applications for design review may be obtained in the new businesszoning division office an application for review must be accompanied by a set of submittals including the following as applicable 1 a zoning application including information on existing and proposed land uses and signage plan if applicable in accordance with  a narrative description of the proposed design or change in design use of materials and colors finish grade line landscaping and orientation of the structure to adjacent properties also include color and material samples artist or architectural renderingsconceptual designs are encouraged though not required 3 an offstreet parking plan drawn to scale showing the location extent nature character dimensions of parking and loading facilities include handicap facilities ingressegress routes total square footage and landscaping also indicate details of lighting drainage and surfacing public or private proposals for construction reconstruction remodeling alterations maintenance repairs or demolition of structures and lands within the subject areas will be classified as either major or minor projects a minor project is one that is defined as such by the facade will be reviewed administratively by the planning and minor projects are those which will not significantly affect the character use and development of surrounding properties major projects are reviewed by the facade committee an application for review by the facade committee must be filed prior to the onset of any work and accompanied by an adequate set of submittals include any presentation material that is essential to the understanding of the proposal and its relationship to its environment upon receipt of an application and submittals adequately describing the project an administrative hearing on the proposal will be scheduled within 5 days excluding weekends approval by the planning division or facade committee will result in issuance of a certificate of appropriateness and subsequently a certificate of zoning compliance after the certificates are secured building and demolition permits may be issued by the division all repair maintenance and demolition work must be completed within 90 days of approval appeals must be filed with the planning division within 45 days of final decision project designers are strongly encouraged to request an early briefing with the planning division staff prior to formal application for a hearing such meetings provide an opportunity for informal discussion of the specific circumstances of the project and how the guidelines might affect its development about the guidelines the guidelines in this document are to be used to implement the goals for downtown improvement and design they are intended to aid project designers in understanding the principal expectations of the city and the concerns and objectives of downtown redevelopment the guidelines are not intended to be inflexible prescriptive requirements and therefore exceptions to them for appropriate proposals may be granted the facade committee while concerned that every project address itself to all applicable guidelines is also interested in encouraging creative solutions to design problems the guidelines are divided into three topic categories general principles special cases and historic preservation they represent the most significant factors affecting the appearance of the downtown area historic preservation has been addressed as a major issue area because of the number of buildings on the national register of historic places as well as the juliaann square and george avery historic districts the guidelines herein focus on relation of buildings space and people they are used to coordinate and enhance the diversity of activities taking place in the downtown area many ways of meeting a particular guideline exist and since it is not the intent to prescribe any specific solution the guidelines encourage a diversity of imaginative solutions to issues raised by this document this set of guidelines is not to be allinclusive but subject to modification goals for downtown planning and design the following goals are proposed as general statements of objectives for planning and design review in parkersburgs downtown 1 enrich the character definition and form of downtown parkersburg 2 recognize and preserve the distinctive historical and architectural character of properties that reflect an earlier period of parkersburgs
