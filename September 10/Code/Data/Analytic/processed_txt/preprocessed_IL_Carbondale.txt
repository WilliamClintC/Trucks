with a nonresidential land use district and is vacant  b the adjacent property has an existing required landscaped buffer  or c the adjacent property has existing vegetation sufficient in size types of plantings and location that serve in the same capacity as a required buffer 2 for projects that propose to retain an undisturbed open space area between the extent of the development and the property line if the director of development services finds that such area will substantially serve the purpose of a buffer the director of development services may give credit to the owner or owners designee for part or all of the undisturbed open space toward the buffer requirements of this section this exemption does not apply to industrial extractive or outdoor recreation uses additionally the plan must show the undisturbed area has an existing mixture of grass trees and shrubs and other vegetation that would serve in the same capacity as the required buffer 3 for projects that are required to provide a buffer to adjacent residentially designated property that is currently vacant the owner or owners designee may plant the required buffer at the proper density and configuration all plants utilized shall be of a type that the growth will reach the required height criteria within a three 3 year period from the time of planting 4 alternative designs for required buffers may be approved by

shall receive zero points d adjustment of number of sides missing sidewalks the points from subsections b1a b1b and b1c above shall be added together for each street segment and then multiplied by the number of sides of the street segment missing sidewalks e rank order to be established all the street segments with three 3 or more points as a result of the procedure in subsection a1a a1b a1c and

conditions the director shall determine these sections to have priority comparable to that of the street sections rated highest under the new construction property criteria established above c other factors in proposing sidewalk construction programs the director shall primarily consider the ranking developed from subsection b above however the director shall also take into consideration other factors including but not limited to 1 absence of curbs and gutters and storm sewers 2 accident rate 3 pedestrian traffic volumes 4 available right of way 5 existence of steep grades or high banks in the event that a physical problem such as absence of curbs and gutters and storm sewers available right of way andor existence of steep grades or high banks set forth above precludes prompt
