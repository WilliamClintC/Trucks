degradation fee pavement degradation fee  purposes a excavations in paved streets degrade and shorten the expected life of the surface of the street in and within at least two feet of the perimeter of the area of excavation this degradation increases the frequency and cost to the public for necessary resurfacing maintenance and repair such pavement degradation occurs regardless of how well the excavated area is restored as the cutting of the pavement and trenching in the streets permits water seepage into the street as well as weakening pavement support around the patch thereby accelerating the streets deterioration b the purposes of the pavement degradation fee are to 1 offset the substantial cost incurred by the public due to the shortened life of the streets when they are excavated by establishing a pavement degradation fee that approximates the depreciated cost per square foot of a single roadway reconstruction and resurfacing  2 provide an incentive to persons or entities making excavations to install maintain and repair underground facilities without making unnecessary or excessive excavations  3 provide an incentive to persons or entities making excavations to minimize the number of excavations being made wherever feasible and use alternative means of construction such as directional boring  and 4 provide an incentive to persons or entities making excavations when feasible to make such excavations in streets that are closer to the end of their useful life c the pavement degradation fee is not intended to 1 impose financial hardship on property owners needing to excavate streets in order to make emergency repairs to buried utilities  2 alter or impair the existing rights of persons or entities holding franchise agreements for use of the public rightsofway for

commercial zoning districts purpose statements a purpose of the nr neighborhood retail business district the nr district is established to promote the continuation of existing commercial centers that provide goods and services primarily for the convenience of the residents of the surrounding neighborhood in addition the district is designed to accommodate limited multifamily housing opportunities in a smallscale mixeduse neighborhood environment the development standards and range of allowable uses for the nr district are designed to maintain a relatively smallscale pedestrianoriented environment with the character of neighborhood commercial districts b purpose of the nr1 linden square neighborhood business district the nr1 linden square district is centered at the intersection of linden avenue and 4th street to promote commercial and multifamily housing primarily for the benefit of district residents and the surrounding neighborhood in a smallscale mixeduse neighborhood environment the development standards and range of allowable uses are designed to maintain a relatively smallscale pedestrianoriented environment that capitalizes on the synergies with the public transportation and tourist activities afforded by the linden cta station bahai house of worship and wilmette harbor c purpose of the gc1 general commercial district the gc1 district is established to provide a location for highervolume and higher intensity commercial uses which provide employment and revenues for the village due to the higher volume of such establishments and the traffic they typically generate the gc1 district is intended to be located along arterial streets and rail lines and generally confined to existing commercial areas to ensure that the traffic generated by such uses does not impact nearby residential neighborhoods and that the uses themselves create less of an impact on residential areas than they would in other locations in the village the development standards for the gc1 district are designed to buffer the gc1 district from nearby residential properties and to maintain the general appearance of major thoroughfares village d purpose of the gc2 heavy commercial district the gc2 district is established to provide a location for commercial uses which do not involve a high level of retail customer traffic or a large number of employees but represent relatively intensive use of land such as establishments involving manufacturing heavy equipment and the processing distribution and storage of goods and equipment the gc2 district is intended to be located only on properties which abut the railroad rightofway and which are not well suited for other commercial or residential uses in order to provide a buffer between the railroad rightofway and nearby residential areas the development standards for the gc2 district are designed to buffer the gc2 district from nearby residential properties and to maintain and improve the general appearance of such areas e purpose of the or officeresearch district the or district is established to promote and accommodate unified development projects for offices research facilities and
