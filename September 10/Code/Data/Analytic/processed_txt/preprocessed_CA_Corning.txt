provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the

tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific

following findings a on city streets sidewalks and intersections the activity of soliciting employment business or contributions from occupants of vehicles is hazardous because it distracts drivers from their primary duty to watch traffic and be alert for potential hazards in the roadway to observe all traffic control signals signs or warnings and to be prepared to move citys streets and intersections b in public and private parking lots and parking structures the activity of soliciting employment business or contributions from occupants of vehicles is hazardous because it distracts drivers from their primary duty to watch other vehicles or pedestrians and to move lot or structure with safety c the practice of soliciting employment business or contributions from within a public street highway or parking facility subjects the solicitor pedestrians and vehicles to an unacceptable level of danger by distracting drivers from their primary duty to watch traffic and results in the delay and obstruction of the publics free flow of travel and results in congestion and blockage of the streets parking lot driveways and sidewalks when such persons approach the vehicles to negotiate with the occupants d distracted drivers are more prone to be involved in automobile accidents  and accidents on the public streets constitute a substantial traffic safety problem e the cumulative impact of this type of activity on the streets highways sidewalks and parking facilities on a daily basis creates a potential safety hazard which poses a significant and substantial risk to the interest of the public in the free flow of travel f solicitation within parking lots and structures is of particular concern because it presents a potentially threatening environment for people traveling to or from their vehicle and provides a greater opportunity for someone desiring to conceal his or her presence from the unsuspecting g people exiting or entering a vehicle are in a very vulnerable position when approached by a solicitor and are exposed to reasonable fear for safety and the possibility of a carjacking robbery or other person or property crime h soliciting in a manner that is confrontational and involves conduct that is perceived by the person being solicited as harassing coercing or intimidating or which obstructs the free passage of that individual is detrimental to the quality of life and economic vitality of the community i soliciting at times and places where individuals feel particularly vulnerable such as during times of darkness or in the vicinity of automatic teller machines causes the person being solicited to feel unsafe which in turn leads to people who would be engaged in legitimate activities tending to avoid certain areas resulting in a decline in business and community life and a possible increase in crime  10272009   definitions the following words and phrases whenever used in this chapter shall be construed as defined in this

council does find that there is substantial new construction of residential and commercial structures in the city which has resulted in serious deficiencies in the drainage of surface water and stormwater from the city area the entire city shall for the purposes of this chapter be considered as one drainage area the ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted pursuant to the provisions of of the government the state of california b the city of corning is located in the county of tehama which has not adopted a countywide general drainage plan and there is no district in the county in which the city is included which has a districtwide general drainage plan  1979   drainage plan generallycosts the city has adopted a drainage plan for the city which plan was adopted by resolution of the city council on  the estimated total cost of constructing the drainage facilities required by the plan is one million eight hundred fifty thousand dollars based on a 1978 engineering news record

is actually undertaken a map showing the drainage area and the location of the drainage facilities is attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter as exhibit a    construction of facilitiesschedule of fees the city council has made findings that the estimated costs of the drainage plan as set forth in are as accurate as possible and that the subdivision and development of property in the city will require construction of the facilities described in the drainage plan the schedule of fees which the city council has adopted by resolution are fairly apportioned within the area of the city on the basis of benefits conferred on property proposed for subdivision or on the need for such facilities created by the proposed subdivision and development of other property within the city    relation to existing facilities the drainage facilities planned are in addition to existing facilities serving the area at the time of the adoption of the drainage plan for the city    drainage feesgenerally the drainage fees provided for in this chapter are in addition to any other fees which might be levied by the city for new construction of either residential or commercial property the drainage fees shall be applied only to lands which are subdivided as shown on a tentative or parcel map filed thirty days or more after  or to developments of real property as used in

or developer the acreage fee which is fixed from time to time by resolution if the city elects to take this option the subdivider or developer is not obligated to provide any offsite drainage work  b to require the subdivider or developer to do offsite drainage works in accordance with city specifications and standards whereby the subdivider or developer would connect the subdivision or development to a natural drain or storm drain subject to the approval of the city engineer the cost to the subdivider or developer of installing the offsite drainage works shall be credited against an amount equal to what the acreage fee would have been and if the cost thereof is less than what the acreage fee would have been the subdivider or developer shall pay to the city the difference between his cost and the acreage fee  traffic mitigation feesstreet bridges and signalization funding and purpose the city council does find that corning is facing considerable growth and such growth will

determined that the simple method of calculating mitigation fees on the basis of equivalent dwelling units edu makes it possible for both builders and the city to quickly calculate costs while ensuring that the costs of infrastructure are spread evenly among all those who wish to build f the initial traffic mitigation fee for streets bridges and traffic signalization shall be set at five

subject matter see the the table and disposition list for full disposition   statutory authorization the legislature of the state of california has in government  and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the city of corning does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations  5282013   findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city of corning are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses  5282013   statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone mudslide ie mudflow or flood related erosion areas these regulations are designed to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruptions  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  g ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  5282013   methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes regulations to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas  5282013   definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them

extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris potential projectiles and erosion potential the following provisions apply a until a regulatory floodway is adopted no new construction substantial development or other development including fill shall be permitted within zones a130 and ae unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed

substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of   5282013   nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  5282013   conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the tehama county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  5282013   appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of the factors of the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of

  purpose a the federal emergency management agency fema requires that floodhazard regulations be adopted by all agencies participating in the national flood insurance program which was established by congress for the purpose of minimizing flood losses by providing federally subsidized flood insurance for existing structures and reduced premiums for new structures to participate in the program the city must adopt and enforce floodplainmanagement measures to reduce the risk of flood losses it is the purpose of the fp combining district to implement this federal mandate to carry out the citys general plan policies regarding development in floodplain areas and to provide landuse regulations in areas with properties situated within the designated floodplains of rivers creeks streams and watercourses in order to 1 protect public health safety and welfare  2 minimize public and private losses as a product of floods or construction in floodhazard areas  3 require that uses vulnerable to floods be protected against flood damage by incorporating floodproof construction standards in their design or be developed outside floodprone areas at the time of their initial construction  4 protect riparian corridors along waterways by reducing alterations to the natural floodplain and stream channels which help accommodate floodwaters by encouraging sensitive development adjacent to and within floodplains  5 prohibit filling grading dredging or development which may individually or cumulatively cause flood damage or danger to life or property  6 prevent stream erosion which may adversely affect the fisheries of streams and the river or cause loss of property  7 prevent the construction of flood barriers which may unnaturally direct floodwaters or raise flood levels thereby increasing flood hazards in other areas  8 protect areas of pleasing appearance to the community and visitors  enhance the natural environment provision of open space  break up the monotony of

along the sacramento river and area creeks from erosion loss of vegetation degradation of water quality and a loss of thermal cooling  13 ensure that adequate capacity for future urban runoff is reserved  14 ensure that as a product of any encroachment into the floodplain flood levels are not significantly raised on other properties resulting in a need for further encroachment to protect the property  15 ensure that stream velocities are not significantly increased which could cause erosion above below or across from an area of encroachment or realignment  16 ensure that proposals to encroach into floodplains fully address the following issues a size of a stream major or minor b existing and future volume of water c existing and future changes in the velocity of water d impact on

watershed hydraulic engineering center model 1 hec1 the model is designed to stimulate the surface runoff response of a stream basin to precipitation by representing the basin as an interconnected system of hydrologic and hydraulic components each component models an aspect of the precipitationrunoff process within a portion of the basin commonly referred to as a subbasin a component may represent a surfacerunoff entity a stream channel or a reservoir representation of a component requires a set of parameters which specify the particular characteristics of the component and mathematical relations which describe the physical processes the result of the modeling process is the computation of stream flow by hydrographs at desired locations in the stream basin the model can be used in making flood predictions from rainfall runoff for any state of upstream urbanization in so doing the model considers time of concentration and detention characteristics of the tributary area the model can also be used to estimate the velocity of surface water but cannot be used to determine backwatercurve elevations a hydraulic computer program hec2 is generally used in conjunction with hec1 to obtain backwater curves or surfacewater profiles the model can be used to develop dischargefrequency curve and associated levels of confidence analysis of rainfall and runoff parameter input hydraulic engineer center model 2 hec2 this model is intended for calculating watersurface profiles for steady gradually varied flow in natural or manmade channels both subcritical and supercritical flow profiles can be calculated the effects of various obstructions such as bridges culverts weirs and structures in the floodplain may be considered in the computations the computational procedure is based on the solution of the onedimensional energy equation with energy loss due to friction evaluated with mannings equation the computational procedure is generally known as the standard step method the program is also designed for application in floodplain management and floodinsurance studies to evaluate floodway encroachments and the designate floodhazard zones also capabilities are available for assessing the effects of channel improvements and levees on watersurface profiles hydraulic engineering center water resources council model cpd13 this model is used in
