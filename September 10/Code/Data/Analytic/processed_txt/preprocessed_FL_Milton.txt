newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence available the aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts see eg findings of the us department of health and human services centers for disease control and prevention 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities see eg final report of the attorney generals commission on pornography 1986 at 377 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids including semen and urine are found in

increases the likelihood of drug dealing and drug use see eg kev inc v  kitsap county 793 f2d 105 1056 9th cir1986 18 the findings noted in subsections b1 b17 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns 19 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 20 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 21 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments 22 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity 23 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 24 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexuallyrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this article 25 the barring of such individuals from the operation of or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of ten years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 26 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by the enactment of this article i 682004 classifications sexually oriented

action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in division 1 subdivision iii of this article if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements  392010 bypass a 1 bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an users treatment facility 2 severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b an user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections c and d of this section c 1 if the user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the wwf at least ten days before the date of the bypass is possible 2 an user shall submit oral notice of any unanticipated bypass that exceeds

becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the wwf may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours d 1 bypass is prohibited and the wwf may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternative to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the industrial user submitted notices as required under paragraph c of this section 2 the wwf may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the wwf determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection d1 of this section  392010 secs 4838548390

proposed development projects with the city comprehensive plan in addition to meeting the concurrency requirements 2 intent it is the intent of this section to ensure the availability of facilities and services necessary to serve the proposed development at the adopted level of service standard concurrent with the impacts of the development it is further the intent to ensure that a concurrency determination is made by the city prior to the issuance of a development order b consistency with comprehensive plan 1 presumption a development proposal shall be presumed to be consistent with the city comprehensive plan if the proposal is found to meet all the requirements of these regulations excepting those aspects of the development addressed by the comprehensive plan but not covered by these regulations 2 challenging the consistency of a development proposal any public official or citizen may question the consistency of a development proposal with the comprehensive plan if a question of consistency is raised the planning and development department shall make a determination of consistency the determination will be made prior to the final approval of the development plan by the city the determination shall be supported with written findings 3 no presumption in favor of concurrency notwithstanding the presumption created in subsection a of this section all applications for development approval within the city shall demonstrate that specified public facilities will be available at the prescribed levels of service concurrent with the impact of the development on those facilities a a determination of compliance with concurrency requirements shall be procedures described in 43c c concurrency management system 1 generally the following method of ensuring concurrency shall be known as the concurrency management system cms for the city of milton the cms is based upon the city comprehensive plan especially the capital improvements element and the adopted level of service standards the system is designed to ensure that the issuance of a development order city development permit or building permit by the city or county building official will not result in a degradation of the adopted levels of service for specified public facilities and services the cms also includes an annual monitoring system for the determination of the availability of adequate capacity of public facilities and services to meet the adopted level of service standards 2 adopted levels of service shall not be degraded a general rule the general rule regarding concurrency is as follows i all applications for development approval shall demonstrate that the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service in the city the adopted levels of service imply that sufficient treatment collection and distribution systems must be available and must be adequate to accommodate the additional demands imposed by the proposed development any new collection and distribution lines shall be sized in accordance with the requirements contained in the city public works manual  and ii the latest point at which concurrency is determined is prior to the final development order approval by the appropriate development approval authority in the case of new subdivisions the latest point at which concurrency is determined is prior to preliminary plat approval b exception notwithstanding subsection 2a of this section the adopted levels of service may be degraded during the actual construction of new facilities if upon completion of the new facilities the adopted levels of service will be met unless otherwise prohibited by local state or federal requirements 3 determination of available capacity for purposes of these regulations the available capacity of a facility shall be determined by a adding together i the total capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service  and ii the total capacity of new facilities if any that will become available on or before the date of occupancy of the development the capacity of new facilities may be counted only if one or more of the following is shown 1 necessary facilities are in place or are under construction at the time the development order or permit is issued  2 the development order is issued contingent upon the necessary facility andor service being in place when the impacts of development occur in the case of residential subdivisions the time at which the impacts of development occur may be considered to be up to three years from final plat approval  3 the necessary facilities are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement which ensures that the necessary facilities andor services will be in place when the impacts of the development occur or for roads and recreational facilities which ensures that the actual construction will commence within three years of the development orders issuance  and 4 the necessary facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for construction at the time of issuance of the development order or development permit for roads parks and recreational facilities the actual construction or provision of service must commence within three years of issuance of the development order or permit b subtracting from that number the sum of i the demand for the service or facility created by the existing development as documented in the city comprehensive plan or as updated based on related state agency data  and ii the demand for the service or facility created by the anticipated completion of other approved developments redevelopment or other development activity 4 action upon failure to show available capacity where available capacity cannot be shown the following methods may be used to maintain the adopted level of service a the project owner or developer may provide the necessary improvements to maintain the adopted level of service in such case the application shall include appropriate plans for improvements documentation that such improvements are designed to provide the capacity necessary to achieve or maintain the level of service and recordable instruments guaranteeing the construction consistent with the calculations of capacity mentioned in subsection 3a of this section b the proposed project may be altered such that the projected level of service is no less than the adopted level of service 5 burden of showing compliance on developer the burden of showing compliance with the level of service requirements shall be upon the developer in order to be approvable applications for development approval shall provide sufficient information to indicate that adequate facilities andor services are available at the adopted los standards at the time of development impact this information shall include but is not limited to the following a statements or letters of available capacity from local utility providers ie sanitary sewer and potable water  b

establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors to be known as the proportionate fairshare program as required by and in a manner consistent with fs  16 b findings 1 the council finds and determines that transportation capacity is a commodity that has a value to both the public and private sector and that the city proportionate fairshare program a provides a method by which the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors  b allows developers to proceed under certain conditions notwithstanding the failure of transportation concurrency by contributing their proportionate fairshare of the cost of a transportation facility  c contributes to the provision of adequate public facilities for future growth and promotes a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning thereby reducing the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of traffic congestion  d maximizes the use of public funds for adequate transportation facilities to serve future growth and may in certain circumstances allow the city to expedite transportation improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for transportation improvements in the capital improvements element  e is consistent with fs  16 and supports the following policies in the city comprehensive plan i transportation element goal 1 objectives 11 policies  the comprehensive plan as amended ii capital improvement element goal 1 objectives 11 policies  the comprehensive plan 2 the proportionate fairshare program shall apply to all developments in city that impact a road segment in the city concurrency management system

or to developments of regional impact dris using proportionate share under fs  12 or to developments exempted from concurrency c requirements 1 an applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fairshare contribution pursuant to the following requirements a the proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and this unified development the city fiveyear capital improvement program cip or an adopted long term concurrency management system includes transportation improvements that upon completion will accommodate the additional traffic generated by the proposed development 2 the city may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency proportionate fairshare program by contributing to an improvement that upon completion will accommodate the additional traffic generated by the proposed development but is not contained in the cip where one of the following apply a the city adopts by resolution or ordinance a commitment to add the improvement to the fiveyear cip no later than the next regular update to qualify for consideration under this section the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the city council and determined to be financially feasible pursuant to fs  16b1 consistent with the comprehensive plan and in compliance with the provisions of these regulations financial feasibility for this section means that additional contributions payments or funding sources are reasonably anticipated during a period not to exceed ten years to fully mitigate impacts on the transportation facilities b if the funds in the adopted city fiveyear cip are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the concurrency management system the city may still enter into a binding proportionate fairshare agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate share is calculated if the proportionate fairshare amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will in the opinion of the governmental entity or entities maintaining the transportation facilities significantly benefit the impacted transportation system to qualify for consideration under this section the proposed improvements must be contained in an adopted short or longrange plan or program of the local government mpo fdot andor transit agency proposed improvements not reflected in an adopted plan or improvement program but that would significantly reduce access problems on a major road such as new roads service roads or improved network development and connectivity may be considered at the citys discretion the improvements funded by the proportionate

the rightofway dedication for the proportionate fairshare payment credit for the dedication of the nonsite related rightofway shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 80 percent of the most recent assessed value by the county property appraiser or at the applicants option by the fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city the applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city if the estimated value of the rightofway dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the citys estimated total proportionate fairshare obligation for that development then the applicant must also pay the difference g

reservoirthis aggregate layer is immediately beneath the choke layer the base is typically 34 inches thick and consists of crushed stones typically 34 to 316 inch besides storing water this high infiltration rate layer provides a transition between the bedding and subbase layers c opengraded subbase reservoirthe stone sizes are larger than the base typically 212 to 34 inch stone like the base layer water is stored in the spaces among the stones the subbase layer thickness depends on water storage requirements and traffic loads a subbase layer may not be required in pedestrian or residential driveway applications d underdrain optionalin instances where pervious concrete is installed over lowinfiltration rate soils an underdrain facilitates water removal from the base and subbase the underdrain is perforated pipe that ties into an outlet structure supplemental storage can be achieved by using a system of perforated pipes in the aggregate layers e geotextile optionalthis can be used to separate the subbase from the subgrade and prevent the migration of soil into the aggregate subbase or base f subgradethe layer of soil immediately beneath the aggregate

be reduced below the minimum requirements of this the number of existing spaces is already less than the requirements of this it may not be further reduced 2 if a building permit was lawfully issued prior to the effective date of this if substantial construction has begun within 180 days of the issuance of a permit the number of offstreet vehicle bicycle and loading spaces is that required by building permit and supersedes the requirements of this change in use when the existing use of a structure or land is changed to a new use parking and bicycle spaces must be provided as required for the new use except as described below 1 no additional vehicle and bicycle parking spaces are required if the change in use would result in an increase of spaces of less than 10% this also applies to a simultaneous change in use of a group of uses on the same lot which together result in a need for an increase in vehicle and bicycle parking spaces of 10% or less the 10% increase is calculated by dividing the number of additional spaces required by the number of spaces required before the increase 2 a change in use is eligible for a parking exemption per 3 a change in use is eligible for shared parking per c change in intensity of use whenever the intensity of a use is increased based on an increase in the number of dwelling units floor area seating capacity or other unit of measurement used to calculate the required number of vehicle and bicycle parking spaces additional spaces must be provided for that increase except as described below 1 whenever there is an increase in the intensity of a use that creates a need for additional vehicle and bicycle parking spaces of 10% or more the additional spaces are required no additional vehicle and bicycle parking spaces are required if the increase in intensity would result in an increase of spaces of less than 10% this also applies to a simultaneous increase in intensity of a group of uses on the same lot which together result in a need for an increase in vehicle and bicycle parking spaces of 10% or more the 10% increase is calculated by dividing the number of additional spaces required by the number of spaces required before the increase 2 an increase in the intensity of a use which does not qualify for an exemption under item 1 above is eligible for a parking exemption per 3 an increase in the intensity of a use which does not qualify for an exemption under item 1 above is eligible for shared parking per d provision of additional spaces and parking maximums 1 the establishment of additional offstreet

goods in offstreet parking areas is prohibited unless otherwise permitted by this general requirements 1 where multiple uses with different parking requirements occupy the same structure or lot the required vehicle and bicycle parking and loading spaces is the sum of the requirements for each use computed separately unless otherwise permitted by this 2 space allocated to any offstreet loading space may not be used to satisfy the requirement for any offstreet vehicle or bicycle parking space or access aisle or portion thereof conversely the area allocated to any offstreet vehicle or bicycle parking space may not be used to satisfy the replacement for any offstreet loading space or portion thereof 3 a fraction of less than onehalf is disregarded and a fraction of onehalf or more is counted as one parking or loading space 4 for uses where patrons or spectators occupy benches pews or open floor areas used for service each 48 linear inches of benches pews or permanent seating areas

certain uses listed within table  are required to provide bicycle parking spaces when located within all residential districts and within the rc1 dcm and sscrc zoning districts required bicycle spaces should be designed as shortterm spaces which are areas where bicycles will be left for short stops requiring a high degree of convenience 8 in situations where the city has previously provided bicycle parking within 250 linear feet in any direction provided there is pedestrian access the use requiring bicycle spaces may provide in lieu of the required bicycle spaces other pedestrian friendly or open space amenities with approval from the planning department 9 where bicycle parking space requirements indicate over 10000 square feet gfa or other number threshold this means that bicycle spaces are required only for structures over a certain gross floor area in these cases bicycle parking space requirements are calculated on the basis of the entire gross floor area 10 motorcycle and scooter parking may be substituted for up to five automobile spaces or 5% of the required parking spaces whichever is less for every four motorcycle parking spaces provided the automobile parking requirement is reduced by one space 142  required number offstreet vehicle and bicycle parking spaces any use not identified in table  shall be required to meet the vehicle parking and bicycle space standards of

is allowed within the district in which it is approved appendix a  city boundary map appendix b  the city of milton bioretention and conveyance systems design guidelines the following design guidelines are intended to present developers within the city of milton information regarding the existence and potential of various alternative onsite stormwater management techniques these guidelines are based on information found in the florida field guide to low impact development created by the university of florida ifas extension this guide provides a broad stroke of information on two commonly used methods of onsite stormwater treatment systems definitions objectives and considerations for these methods are outlined in the following passages installation and maintenance of these items shall be based on manufacturer and engineering specifications a bioretention areas description bioretention basins or areas often referred to as rain gardens are typically shallow planted depressions which are designed to retain or detain stormwater onsite before it is either infiltrated or discharged downstream rain gardens typically refer to bioretention basins which are smaller in scope and scale often times utilized on individual residential lots and small nonresidential developments bioretention basins on the other hand are larger areas designed to handle more intense developments such as multifamily and larger nonresidential sites as common areas objective bioretention basins regardless of size retain filter and treat stormwater runoff using the basin dimensions soil types and conditioning depending upon design bioretention basins can provide retention or detention of runoff to trap and remove suspended solids and also filter or absorb pollutants as part of infiltration or prior to discharge into the citys stormwater system applications generally speaking bioretention basins should be limited to the following types of developments size and design shall be dependent upon development size and type as well as the desired outcome of the basin residential yards including multifamily development  commercial development  parking lot islands  and roadways benefits 1 water protection  bioretention basins can remove pollutants plant uptake and absorption 2 runoff reduction  bioretention basins are designed to capture and retain stormwater onsite reducing the need for larger holding ponds and stormwater transmission offsite 3 improved aesthetics  bioretention basins and rain gardens improve the aesthetic value of development and help to reduce irrigation costs site and design considerations 1 inflow and outflow characteristics of the site must be considered as well as the basins place in the overall landscape design and treatment system 2 generally these areas are utilized to encourage and increase infiltration location of the system in relation to other site components and soils should always be considered for instance bioretention basins should not be placed where ponding historically occurred on site nor should a basin be placed over a septic tank 3 infiltration systems must be designed with soil types and water table depths in mind underdrains may need to be incorporated where soil conductivity is low 4 basin slope should be a maximum of  ponding depths should not exceed 12 inches and ponding duration should not exceed 24 hours after a storm event 5 safety concerns and mosquito mitigation should also be considered when designing a bioretention system b bioswales description a bioswale is a vegetated swale or depression used to partially treat water quality to retain and move stormwater runoff and to attenuate flooding potential bioswales are similar to bioretention basins in structure but are typically more linear in design objective bioswales are designed to function as openchannels or drainage ways which either convey or hold stormwater runoff they can be used in conjunction with and as an enhancement of traditional stormwater systems or as a standalone alternative bioswales can be designed for transmission or for storage and infiltration applications 1 bioswales can be used on a larger scale than bioretention basins and rain gardens they are typically utilized in parking lot islands and medians as roadside and even highway median systems one of the most appropriate applications are within landscape buffer yards 2 there are typically two types of swales utilized by development wet swales and dry swales 3 wet swales use storage time and vegetation to reduce flow and trap pollutants and increase water quality dry swales are designed to facilitate infiltration of stormwater there by treating both the quantity and quality of stormwater runoff as well both designs are typically aspects of larger stormwater treatment systems and work best in conjunction with bioretention basins and other infiltration areas benefits the benefits of bioswales are similar to bioretention basins they mitigate against flooding or transmission of stormwater runoff improve water quality absorption and infiltration and can be integrated into landscape designs as aesthetically pleasing components often times if designed properly with xeriscaping or other techniques landscaping irrigation costs can be substantially lower than normal systems which require scheduled watering site and design considerations again there are a lot of similarities in the siting and design considerations between bioswales and bioretention basins soil types water table depth and service area size all need to be considered as well as the amount of impervious surface area and the slope of the area being served 1 bioswales should be used in areas that are not overly flat or in areas which are too steep 2 as a rule of thumb when designing a bioswale or system of bioswales areas larger than ten acres with slopes greater than 5% should not be served by a bioswales alone but could certainly be utilized as a component of a larger stormwater system 3 soil composition is an important consideration when determining placement and design of bioswale systems as well as a bioswales place in the larger landscaped area and stormwater system 4 plant material selection is key to water quality treatment and to the effective life of a swale plants that are less water tolerant or nonnative species may not survive or may not treat the water as well as others appendix a  franchises and agreements article i  gulf power company ordinance no 115504 an ordinance to be entitled an
