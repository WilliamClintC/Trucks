statutory authorization the legislature of the state has in section  of the texas water  delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c statement of purpose it is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 1996 sec     89385 unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning

prior to construction a protective mulching all designated trees shall have a minimum of four inches 4 of mulch placed from the base of the tree to the designated trees drip line to reduce soil compaction b pruning if a lowhanging limb is broken during the course of construction the remaining portion of the limb may be cut the limb shall be cut either flush to the trunk on or at the next joint of the limb the wound shall then be sealed with pruning paint in no instance shall pruning involve a portion of the trunk or thirty percent 30% of the entire canopy without the administrative officials prior approval 3 improvements within critical root zone design constraints often dictate that designated trees slated for preservation have some encroachment on their critical root zone the following are the minimum design criteria allowed within the critical root zone of a designated tree development exceeding the criteria would put the designated tree at risk and therefore it will no longer be considered a preserved designated tree in such case replacement trees shall also be required a grade changes in the event that grade changes must be made around a designated tree or group of designated trees the following shall be implemented in order to maintain oxygen and water exchange within the designated trees critical root zone i a minimum of seventyfive percent 75% of the critical root zone must be preserved at natural grade with natural ground cover or landscaping for the tree to be considered a preserved designated tree ii no cut or fill greater than two inches 2 shall be located closer to the tree trunk than onehalf 12 of the radius of the critical root zone radius distance iii decrease grade provide retaining walls outside the drip line to mitigate cuts b boring of

trees shall be performed by hand or small equipment to minimize damage d trees most heavily impacted by construction activities should be watered deeply once a week during periods of hot and dry weather tree crowns should be sprayed with water periodically to reduce dust accumulation on the leaves e trenching for landscape irrigation shall be located as far from the existing tree drip line as possible and performed by hand or air spade f pruning to provide clearance for structures vehicular traffic and equipment shall take place before construction begins 1996 sec  approved replacement

digging please call 1800digtess to identify the location of any underground utilities b dig a hole twice as wide as and slightly shallower than the root ball roughen the sides and bottom of the hole with a pick or shovel so that roots can penetrate the soil c with a potted tree gently remove the tree from the container lay the tree on its side with the container end near the planting hole hit the bottom and sides of the container until the root ball is loosened if roots are growing in a circular pattern around the root ball slice roots on a couple of sides of the root ball with trees wrapped in burlap remove the string or wire that holds the burlap to the root crown it is unnecessary to completely remove the burlap plastic wraps must be completely removed gently separate circling roots on the root ball shorten exceptionally long roots and guide the shortened roots downward and outward root tips die quickly when exposed to light and air so dont waste time d place the root ball in the hole leave the top of the root ball where the roots end and the trunk begins 12 inch to 1 inch above the surrounding soil making sure not to cover it unless roots are exposed for bare root plants make a mound of soil in the middle of the hole and spread plant roots out evenly over the mound do not set trees too deep as you add soil to fill in around the tree lightly tamp the soil to collapse air pockets or add water to help settle the soil form a temporary water basin around the base of the tree to encourage water penetration and water thoroughly after planting a tree with a dry root ball cannot absorb water  if the root ball is extremely dry allow water to trickle into the soil by placing the hose at the trunk of the tree    107385 e mulch around the tree a 3footdiameter circle of mulch 4 deep is common f depending on the size of the tree and the site conditions staking may be beneficial staking supports the tree until the roots are well established to properly anchor it staking should allow for some movement of the tree after trees are established remove all support wires if these are not removed they can girdle the tree cutting into the trunk and eventually killing the tree 1996 sec  article 309 signs division 1 generally purpose the principal objectives and purpose of this article of the ordinances are to 1 provide a reasonable system for the control of signs
