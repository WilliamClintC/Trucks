city of muskegon downtown form based code i1 introduction form based codes fbc represent a paradigm shift in the way that we regulate the built environment this shift was necessary because the conventional usebased approach to zoning has been shown to be ineffective for regulating diverse urban mixeduse environments the city of muskegon is using form based coding to achieve the vision goals and outcomes for downtown that were established by previous planning endeavors conducted by the city and her citizens these plans include the 2003 imagine muskegon plan the 2008 downtown and lakeshore redevelopment plan and the 2015 city of muskegon parking strategy these plans and strategies envision a downtown that is a walkable mixeduse urban place with a diversity of housing choices vibrant retail restaurants and services and a mix of job opportunities the formal short definition of a formbased as follows form based codes foster predictable built results and a highquality public realm by using physical form rather than separation of uses as the organizing principle for the code these codes are adopted into city or county law as regulations not mere guidelines formbased codes are an alternative to conventional zoning  form based codes institute unlike conventional codes fbcs use the intended form and character of a place or context as the organizing principle or framework of the code rather than use and regulate a series of important elements not just to create a good individual building but rather a highquality urban place the naming conventions in fbcs reflect the intended physical form and hierarchy of different places so instead of a zone being labeled singlefamily residential it might be called neighborhood edge and instead of a zone being called commercial or mixed use it might be called main street the terms neighborhood and main street tie back to the intended physical form or place both of which may include a mix of uses and different building types that create vibrant walkable urbanism it is also important to note that while fbcs primarily regulate an intended physical form they also regulate use secondarily fbcs often allow a range of uses that are carefully chosen to maximize compatibility between uses and the intended physical form of the downtown the use tables are simplified and categorized by use type and clearly defined to allow a greater degree of administrative decisionmaking related to particular uses                                                                                      6th st 5th st pine st western ave clay ave

foundation for the muskegon form based code many plans have been completed during the last decade to reenvision downtown muskegon these plans provide the foundation for the muskegon form based the communitycreated plans provide a broad series of goals and help to paint a communitysupported vision for the future the fbc is intended as a tool to implement that vision imagine muskegon in 200 the city of muskegon completed the 2003 imagine muskegon plan with the intent of developing a conceptual design that reflected a broad range of community input and that sparked the imagination of the greater muskegon community this plan established a concept design that envisioned downtown as follows destination muskegon as a focal point for the region offering events services shops and dining not found elsewhere the area should be designed so that people are attracted to the downtown for its unique blend of entertainment dining and specialty stores diverse and inclusive downtown should be designed to accommodate various age groups socioeconomic backgrounds and cultural and racial heritages walkable infrastructure shall facilitate pedestrian activity along the waterfront and the ambiance of the lakefront views and the context of the heritage district should be central to this pedestrian activity streetscapes should reinforce walkability with outdoor amenities and landscape connected and multimodal provide interconnections so bicyclists joggers and walkers have attractive paths to enjoy provide for alternative transportation like trolleys so that more people can share the road with cars while cars are accommodated downtown they should not dominate the environment livable a mix of housing opportunities that provide choices to a wide range of people including highquality affordable apartments condominiums cottages and singlefamily homes distinctive new development should fit in to the historic context of downtown the pattern of development shall have identifiable centers and edges that respect historic and contextual block structures and street networks 1 2 3 4 5 6 imagine muskegon city of muskegon downtown form based code i3 2008 downtown and lakeshore redevelopment plan in 200 the city of muskegon completed the downtown and lakeshore redevelopment plan with the intent to advance the redevelopment and improvement of the downtown and lakeshore areas this plan established a clear goal vision and included a series of objectives and programs to implement and achieve that vision additionally the downtown and lakeshore redevelopment plan created a future land use plan that became the foundation for the context area map  of the fbc the plans vision in 202 downtown muskegon and its adjoining lakefront will be an attractive and vibrant community asset with a healthy and prosperous mix of retail office housing arts and cultural institutions and other land uses to serve the needs of permanent residents and visitors alike the character of downtown developments will reflect the unique culture and history of muskegon and will compliment existing facilities downtown will have an urban feel with convenient parking public transportation walkable streets and strong connections to neighborhoods selected objectives of the plan the downtown lakeshore will be redeveloped as a mixed use district including office retail housing and educationalresearch uses with frequent public access points and public open space downtown will have strong nonmotorized transportation facilities to connect destination points and provide linkages to neighborhoods including bike paths bike lanes and designated bike routes on low volume roads downtown will have a balanced transportation system that facilitates ease of movement with twoway streets mass transit and traffic calming features to enhance pedestrian circulation and provide strong visual and physical connections to adjoining neighborhoods context sensitive architecture will be used in the development of new facilities to reflect the character of existing buildings and the working waterfront selected programs implementation steps of the plan amend the zoning provide standards regulating architecture site utilization landscaping window coverage pedestrian amenities and building form so new buildings integrate well with existing structures implement a shared use parking system zoning requirements to increase the use of parking while potentially reducing the quantity of downtown surface parking required transform webster street and muskegon street into

d 2008 future land use map i4 downtown form based code city of muskegon introduction creating a solid foundation for the muskegon form based code muskegon parking strategy in 201 in anticipation of completion of this form based the city of muskegon commissioned a downtown parking study to implement a series of short mid and longterm policies to address the future of downtowns parking these policies provided an opportunity to proactively shape the future of downtown muskegon by 1 supporting commerce and economic development 2 creating and providing mobility choice 3 building quality of life and business vitality 4 reinforcing a wide range of lifestyle choices 5 optimizing access and opportunities and 6 promoting convenience turnover and predictability while being responsive to customers these six opportunities were based on the vision and goals of previously completed plans and led to a series of solutions that created tools that can be implemented in order to foster a more livable and vibrant downtown these solutions include management based solutions to provide effective means to gather and analyze downtown parking conditions as they evolve allowing the system to proactively respond to both short and longterm trends demand based solutions to diminish the demand for parking by reducing the number of total vehicle trips downtown which in turn reduces the parking required for those vehicles supply based solutions to adjust the amount of new parking supplied by establishing a marketbased approach to setting parking standards that is consistent with desired urban densities and character while also supporting alternative modes of transportation place based solutions to transform the public realm from a singlemode system to a multimode system that can improve the walkability of the downtown and create more mobility options and choice these tools make it easier for users to find parking opportunities which improve access to existing parking and ease perceived congestion of parking facilities time based solutions to encourage turnover in higher demand areas and shift users with longer term parking needs into offstreet facilities or more remote locations factors that can influence time based tools include the surrounding land use time of day and availability of supply price based solutions to shift demands and use patterns to reduce occupancy in high demand areas and create a market for offstreet parking 1 2 3 4 5 6 existing downtown parking and land use the graphics below depict the existing land area utilized in downtown
