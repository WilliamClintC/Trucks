area shall result in the acreage of the entire parcel not in tidal wetlands counting against the growth allocation unless the development concept outlined in item b below is used b in order to allow some flexibility in the use of growth allocation when development is only proposed on a portion of the property the following methodology may be used on a parcel proposed for the use of growth allocation a single development envelope may be specified and the acreage of the development envelope rather than the acreage of the entire parcel shall be deducted from the towns growth allocation if the development envelope meets the following criteria 1 the development envelope shall include individually owned lots required buffers impervious surfaces roads utilities storm water management measures onsite sewage disposal measures any acres subject to human use such as active recreation acres and any additional acreage needed to meet the development requirements of the criteria the required buffers refer to the minimum 100foot buffer and the 25 foot nontidal wetlands buffer 2 only one development envelope shall be established per parcel of land 3 if a development envelope is proposed in the rca a minimum of 20 acres must remain outside of the development envelope or the acreage of the entire parcel must be deducted if the original parcel in the rca is less than 20 acres then the acreage of the entire parcel must be deducted if there is a permanently protected resource conservation area an area protected by easement adjacent and contiguous to a residue that is less than 20 acres that will result in a minimum 20acre residue then the entire parcel does not have to be deducted 4 the minimum 20acre residue outside of the development envelope may be developed at an rca density unless some type of permanent protection exists that restricts development c for growth allocation areas proposed in the rca a 300foot naturally vegetated buffer is strongly encouraged and where is provided it shall not be deducted even if the buffer does not meet the 20acre minimum requirement zoning grandfathering 1 continuation of existing uses the town shall permit the continuation but not necessarily the intensification or expansion of any use in existence on the date of program approval unless the use has been abandoned for more than one year or is otherwise restricted by the

land not being part of a recorded or approved subdivision that was recorded as of  and land that was subdivided into recorded legally buildable lots where the subdivision received the towns final approval prior to  if at the time of development the land is brought into conformance with the critical area program insofar as possible including the consolidation or reconfiguration of lots not individually owned c it is on land that was subdivided into recorded legally buildable lots where the subdivision received the towns final approval between  and   and d it is on land that was subdivided into recorded legally buildable lots where the subdivision received the final approval after  and provided that either development of any such land conforms to the ida lda or rca

protection works means those structures or measures constructed or installed to prevent or minimize erosion of the shoreline in the critical area the use of structural devices to protect the shoreline from erosion can result in a significant disturbance to the aquatic environment and increase erosion downstream this section sets forth a plan for limiting the use of structural erosion control devices to only those areas where major erosion problems exist as an alternative to structural erosion controls the town encourages the use of nonstructural controls such as marsh creation maintenance of buffer zones and the establishment of natural barriers to prevent destruction of fragile vegetative shoreline the criteria set forth in this not intended to apply to those structures necessarily associated with waterdependent facilities as discussed in of this general policies in protecting shore areas from erosion the town shall follow these policies a encourage the protection of rapidly eroding portions of the shoreline in the critical area by public and private landowners  b where such measures can effectively and practically reduce or prevent shore erosion encourage the use of nonstructural shore protection measures in order to conserve and protect plant fish and wildlife habitat 3 standards for erosion protection the town shall consider the following standards when evaluating shore erosion control projects 1 structural control measures shall only be used in areas where appreciable erosion occurs and where nonstructural measures would not be practical or effective in controlling erosion zoning 2 where structural erosion control is required the measure that best provides for conservation of fish and plant habitat and which is practical and effective shall be used  3 nonstructural measures shall be utilized in areas of erosion where they would be a practical and effective method of erosion control  4 structural erosion measures shall not be encouraged in areas where no significant erosion occurs  5 if significant alterations in the characteristics of a shoreline occur the measure that best fits the change may be used for sites in that area e implementation the town shall require that each application for shore erosion protection demonstrate how it complies with the preceding standards f shoreline changes the town recognizes that storms and other natural events may change current shoreline erosion patterns as such an individual may request the use of a structural erosion control device in an area currently designated for nonstructural controls this request must be accompanied by documentation which identifies the specific location of the site to be protected and a description of the event or events which led to the change in the erosion pattern g process the town in reviewing any application for a permit for structural erosion control devices shall refer the application to the maryland department of the environment for field verification of the need for the structural erosion control as well as for recommendations on proposed erosion control mechanisms 1 any application made to the town for the installation of an erosion control device must at a minimum include the following information a photograph of erosion problem  b the specific location of the site on a usgs 75 topographic map  c soil

species for example relatively mature forested areas within the critical area of 100 acres or more or forest connected with these areas shall be conserved e existing riparian forests for example those relatively mature forest of at least 300 feet in width which occur adjacent to streams wetlands or the bay shoreline and which are documented breeding areas shall be conserved 4 process if a forest is to be developed a sitespecific field investigation shall be conducted to determine important sensitive species present and to make sure that appropriate protection measures are incorporated into the development plan the department of natural resources will make specific recommendations based on an evaluation of the site and the proposed development in general the following measures are recommended a minimize forest and woodlands disturbance from may of each year  b focus all development on the periphery of the forest or woodlands  c retain the forest canopy as well as shrub understory  zoning d retain snag and mature seed trees as dens for woodpeckers and as nests for bald eagles  e discourage the creation of small clearings and expansion of forest edge habitats  and f encourage reestablishment of native forests and woodlands 5 policies for the establishment or replacement of forest the following policies should be used for afforestation and reforestation a the

measures are required a the installation or introduction of concrete riprap or other artificial surfaces onto the bottom of natural streams shall be prohibited unless it can be demonstrated that water quality and fisheries habitat can be improved b channelization or other physical alterations which may change the course or circulation of a stream and thereby interfere with the movement of fish shall be prohibited c the town shall require each development activity that occurs within a watershed draining to anadromous fish propagation waters to fulfill the following objectives 1 minimize development activities or land disturbances within the watershed  2 maintain or if practicable improve water quality in affected streams or other water bodies  3 minimize to the extent possible the

as described in comar 11b5 shall be prohibited between march 1 and june 15 of each year reserved reserved zoning highway corridor overlay district purpose 1 the purpose of establishing this overlay district is to protect andor enhance the aesthetic and visual character of the town of perryville and to provide for and promote orderly growth of the same the highway corridor overlay district regulations are intended to supplement the regulations of the underlying zoning districts and to provide for the harmony and compatibility of development along the major highway corridors that serve as gateways to the community when other provisions of this more restrictive they shall apply all development within this district shall be subject to the procedures standards and guidelines specified in the following sections in addition to those standards pertaining to the particular base zoning district in which the development occurs in cases of conflict the more restrictive standards andor requirements shall apply in particular the purpose of the special overlay district is as follows a to encourage and better articulate positive visual experiences along the towns major existing and proposed highways b to provide for the continued safe and efficient use of these roadways c to maintain natural beauty and scenic cultural and positive visual character of the corridor particularly distinctive views vistas and visual continuity d minimize intersection and site access points these purposes will be accomplished of proposed developments within this overlay zoning district by the planning commission which shall review the location character and appearance of new development in a positive manner it is the purpose of such review to determine in a cooperative fashion with the applicant whether a proposed plan meets the guidelines and other standards of this zoning district 2 the highway corridor overlay zoning district shall include all lands within 500 feet of each side of the center line of the following rightsofway us 40 i95 and md 222 the approximate boundary of the overlay district shall be shown on the official zoning map and shall be shown as a surveyed line by the applicant on each property subject to review affected development 1 all development plan applications including applications for building permits site plan review and subdivision approval for development located in the highway corridor overlay district shall be reviewed by the planning commission for compliance with this changes subject to approval by the commission shall receive such approval before proceeding 2 in the case of applications for development plan approval on properties already developed for example an application for a building permit for an addition to an existing building shall be zoning required to comply with the provisions of this to the extent possible as determined by the planning commission for the purposes of this the term to the extent possible shall not preclude the planning commission from requiring existing pavement be removed to enable establishment of visual enhancement buffer yards that entrancesexits and site traffic circulation be modified to improve channelization of traffic and reduction andor consolidation of entrancesexits on major highways or removal andor replacement of existing signs and associated lighting 3 development activity permitted within the district a any alteration of existing conditions of the land uses or structures within the highway corridor overlay district requiring a permit from the town from the date of enactment of this section shall henceforth be done as provided for by this section or by other sections of this the overlay district regulations are supplementary to the permitted uses and requirements for the appropriate underlying zoning district as contained in of this development activity prohibited within the district uses prohibited in the underlying zoning district are also prohibited in the overlay district tree protection the following regulations supplement but do not supersede the forest conservation by the town of perryville on date adopted and as amended 1 development of land for different uses and intensity of uses will often times necessitate the removal of trees to accommodate roads parking buildings and facilities it is the expressed intent of this every effort be made design layout and construction of development projects to incorporate and save as many trees as possible 2 no person shall cut destroy move or remove any living diseasefree tree of any species having a trunk with a diameter of eight 8 inches or larger in conjunction with any development of land governed by this until such removal or destruction has been approved under the provisions of this diameter is measured 45 feet above the ground and is referred to as diameter at breast height dbh 3 no person shall cut or clear land of trees for the sole purpose of offering land for sale 4 the clearcutting of trees is prohibited the term clearcutting as used herein shall mean the cutting of more than 75 percent of the trees six inches in trunk diameter or larger clearcutting pursuant to an approved development plan shall require the planting of replacement trees as indicated in the detailed landscape plan accompanying the development application 5 a survey of all trees of applicable size shall be made and submitted in conjunction with the development site layout all trees proposed for removal shall be clearly noted zoning retention of andor creation of a minimum visual buffer along highway corridor rightofways 1 each approved application for development shall provide a minimum visual buffer between the rightofway line of the subject roadway and all proposed structures and parking areas the purpose of the minimum visual buffer is to soften the appearance of structures and parking lots from the road to screen vehicular headlight glare on and off site and to lessen spillover light from onsite lighting the buffer shall be continuous except as set forth in 2 below and be no less than the requirements for buffer yard b see attached sketch of buffer yard b contained in appendix b depth across the existing rightofway line or from the new rightof way line should the application under consideration be required to or voluntarily provide a dedication of or easement for proposed roadway purposes the minimum buffer yard depth shall not occur at the high activity areas of a project these areas include but are not limited to building entrances dropoffs and drivethrus to determine the average depth of the minimum visual buffer measurements shall be taken at intervals not greater than ten 10 feet perpendicular to the property line side buffer areas required by other sections of this deep narrow land areas shall not be used when calculating the minimum visual buffer where lagoons and drainage swales occur in the minimum visual buffer because of natural land forms or drainage patterns additional buffer depth and vegetation shall be required to augment the screening effect 2 the intent of the minimum visual buffer is to leave the naturally occurring buffer vegetation intact for its softening effect this buffer may be enhanced or created where such vegetation is insufficient or nonexistent with trees and shrubs of a variety of species appropriate to town character if the minimum visual buffer already has trees of protected size and species as noted herein their preservation is required where masses of native shrubs are present their preservation with minimum disturbance is strongly encouraged while complete screening of a project is not required sufficient plant material shall be installed to accomplish the softening effect required in 1 above in order to maintain the screening effect existing vegetation shall not be limbedup from the ground more than five 5 feet to the lowest branches however if understory planting is planned existing vegetation may with the approval of the zoning administrator be limbedup to a height that will provide adequate sunlight to those plants minimum height and caliper of new trees shall be consistent with provisions of the tree protection requirements in above minimum height of new shrubs used to create the minimum visual buffer shall be three feet these plantings shall be shown on a master landscape plan meeting the requirements of  the buffer management requirements of of the apply to the minimum visual buffer on properties located in the critical area exemptions from buffer requirements exemptions whether partial or total from the buffer yard provisions may be granted by the planning commission if it can be sufficiently demonstrated that such buffer yard will have a deleterious visual effect upon an existing situation or that preservation of existing trees andor other unique natural vegetative resource particular effort on the part of a developer in protecting the existing natural zoning environment warrants the relaxation of buffer yard requirements the following outlines those anticipated situations where the buffer yard requirement may be relaxed or removed 1 protection of existing visual environment in the following cases where the characteristics of the existing visual environment would be detracted from by the provision of a required buffer yard a views and vistas of existing buildings which exhibit a high degree of aesthetic value serving to heighten the visual experience serve as important points of spatial identification contain value as important historical resources b views and vistas of existing natural landscapetopographical features of a particular locale which correspond to certain high points affording panoramic views views to settlement clusters views of water valleys and other elements of the physical landscape c views and vistas to existing recreationalopen space areas whether natural or manmade which serve to contribute to the overall visual environment uses such as golfcourses local parks cemeteries d views and vistas to which give the observer an awareness of a locations inherent character related to views of farmland pastures water activities such as docks or other maritime activities specific to the area 2 protection of proposed visual environment in the following cases where a proposed development intended to further enhance or protect the existing visual environment would be visually affected by the required buffer yard a a proposed development which by virtue of the characteristics of its structures indicates innovation of design a unique relationship with the site represents a focal point establishes a particular identifying element for the locale b a proposed development which exhibits innovative or unique uses of site landscaping or which combines in the use of the site open recreational areas such as described above 3 retention of existing natural attributes of the site in this case significant steps must be taken by a developer to preserve significant tree stands topographic characteristics even in the event that such elements are in locations where they are not wholly visible the intent is to provide incentives to retain the features of the existing natural environment rather than encourage its destruction and then to remedy the situation with new plantings 4 management of existing and proposed resources in order to encourage management programs for visual natural resources so that the continuation of such resource is assured buffer yard requirements may be reduced or waived permitted activity in minimum visual buffer 1 no existing vegetation of any type size or origin shall be altered or removed unless it satisfies the tree protection requirements of zoning  within the minimum visual buffer there shall be no development clearing grading or construction activity except for the following a roadway andor driveway access to the portion of the site not in the minimum visual buffer provided that it is approximately perpendicular to rightofway b provision for water sanitary sewer storm drainage electrical telephone natural gas cable etc service lines provided they are approximately perpendicular to the rightofway in the event that utilities must be installed approximately parallel to the road rightof way an equal amount of buffer may be required to substitute for the area of vegetation removal permission for easement and rightofway disturbance and clearing for such services shall be more favorably considered when such activity is consolidated with vehicular access routes c pedestrian and bicycle paths designed to provide continuous connection along the road corridor provided that they can be constructed without materially reducing the screening and visual softening capacity of the vegetation buffer d lighting fixtures only for approved signs or if for safety reasons they cannot be placed outside the buffer and then only when electric utility lines serving these fixtures and necessary easements can be established and constructed without reducing the screening and visual softening capacity of the vegetation buffer e signs in accordance with the sign regulations in reasonable effort should be made to locate all signage outside of the buffer f clear sight distances at the permitted entrances and exits to any development as needed to provide for reasonable traffic safety in accordance with accepted traffic engineering practices architectural review 1 guidelines the compatible relationship of architecture along highway corridors is of public concern the intent of the architectural review is not to stifle innovative architectural design but to assure respect for and reduce incompatible and adverse impacts on the visual experience from the roadway to accomplish this the planning commission shall use the following guidelines in reviewing proposed structures site improvements signs and streetscape improvements a proposed development shall avoid excessive or unsightly grading indiscriminate earth moving or clearing of property and removal of trees and vegetation that could cause disruption of natural water courses or disfigure natural land forms b proposed development shall be located and configured in a visually harmonious manner with the terrain and vegetation of the parcel

consumption and environmental quality considerations such as heat loss heat gain air emission and runoff water quality g streetscape improvements and external changes 1 streetscape improvements include those architectural or functional facilities or structures that occur on site but are not part of the building and that encourage and facilitate human interaction with the environment examples include but are not limited to the following decorative light fixtures fountains sculpture benches and tables planters retaining walls pedestrian and bicycle paths bicycle parking structure trash receptacles and enclosures vendor areas bollards and fences these improvements shall be designed to be consistent with all guidelines listed above and shall be reviewed for aesthetic functionality and compatibility with the towns character 2 decorative lowlevel intensity nonconcealed source lighting that defines vehicular andor pedestrian ways may be acceptable if part of a lighting master plan it is strongly discouraged as general lighting for a development the master plan must show the relationship of the fixtures and the light patterns to each other to the project site to unit development and to the highway corridors 3 external changes to streetscape improvements and existing structures and sites subject to review by the planning commission shall be consistent with all guidelines and standards in this section external changes of a minor nature include external color and structural material changes parking lot additions and alterations relocation of accessory structures and similar minor changes as determined by the zoning administrator h signs permanent 1 applicants for new or replacement signs in the highway corridor overlay district shall apply to the planning commission for

use in a nonresidential zone or a nonconforming use in a residential zone is permissible with a zoning permit a specialexception permit shall nevertheless be required if the planning commission finds that the proposed use would have an extraordinary impact on neighboring properties or the general public in making this determination the planning commission shall consider among other factors whether the use is proposed for an undeveloped or previously developed lot whether the proposed use constitutes a change from one principal use classification to another whether the use is proposed for a site that poses peculiar traffic or other hazards or difficulties and whether the proposed use is substantially unique or is likely to have impacts that differ substantially from those presented by other uses that are permissible in the zoning district in question permissible uses and specific exclusions 1 the presumption established by this zoning that all legitimate uses of land in the town are provided for within at least one zoning district in the towns planning jurisdiction because the list of permissible uses set forth in the table of permissible uses cannot be all inclusive those uses that are listed shall be interpreted liberally to include other uses that have similar impacts to the listed uses 2 notwithstanding all uses that are not listed in the table of permissible uses even given the liberal interpretation mandated by are prohibited nor shall the table of permissible uses be interpreted to allow a use in one zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another specified use that is permissible in other zoning districts 3 no building or tract of land shall be devoted to any use other than a use permitted hereinafter in the zoning district

constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot or b is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use for example a swimming pooltennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential subdivision or multifamily development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal uses even though such facilities if developed apart from a residential development would require a specialexception permit 2 the following activities so long as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above are specifically regarded

in this article concerning the amount size location and nature of recreational facilities and open space to be provided in connection with residential developments are established by the town as standards that presumptively will result in the provision of that amount of recreational facilities and open space that is consistent with officially adopted town plans the town recognizes however that due to the particular nature of a tract of land or the nature of the facilities proposed for installation or other factors the underlying objectives of this article may be achieved even though the standards are not adhered to with mathematical precision therefore the permitissuing body is authorized to permit minor deviations from these standards whenever it determines that a the objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to them  and b because of peculiarities in the developers tract of land or the facilities proposed it would be unreasonable to require

compliance with this requirement shall be determined as follows 1 if the use is not a subdivision and is located on a lot that is served by an existing power line and the use can be served by a simple connection to such power line as opposed to a more complex distribution system such as would be required in an apartment complex or shopping center then no further certification is needed zoning  if the use is a subdivision or is not located on a lot served by an existing power line or a substantial internal distribution system will be necessary then the electric utility service provider must

screening shading landscaping and environmental standards buffers purpose 1 one of zonings most important functions is the division of land uses into districts which have similar character and contain compatible uses all uses permitted in any district have generally similar nuisance characteristics buffer yards will operate to minimize the negative impact of any future use on neighboring uses 2 the buffer yard is a combination of setback and a visual buffer or barrier and is a yard or area together with the planting required thereon both the amount of land and the type and amount of planting specified for each buffer yard requirement of this specified and are designed to ameliorate nuisances between adjacent zoning districts to ensure a desired character along public streets and roads the planting units required of buffer yards have been calculated to ensure that they do in fact function as buffers 3 buffer yards shall be required to separate different zoning districts from each other in order to eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as dirt litter noise glare of lights signs and unsightly buildings or parking areas or to provide spacing to reduce adverse impacts of noise odor or danger from fires or explosions mature woodlands are considered the best buffers and should be used whenever possible location of buffer yards buffer yards shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel extending to the lot or parcel boundary line buffer yards shall not be located on any portion of an existing or dedicated public or private street or rightofway buffer yards shall not be located within a yard required in a single family attached townhouse development or planned unit development determination of required buffer yard to determine the type of buffer yard required on a parcel or between two parcels or between a parcel and a street the following procedure shall be used 1 identify whether any portion or property line of the site constitutes a zoning district boundary if it does determine the zoning on both sides of the property 2 determine whether the land on the adjoining property is vacant or developed or whether a plat of the subdivision has been approved 3 classify any street adjacent to the proposed use as a local collector or arterial street zoning  determine the buffer yard required on each boundary or segment thereof of the subject parcel by referring to the tables of required buffer yards 5 determine if the proposed development is a use which has buffer yards required to separate that use from certain uses then determine the buffer yard required between such uses by referring to the tables of required buffer yards responsibility for buffer yards 1 when a proposed use adjoins a vacant parcel for which a buffer yard is required by the presence of a zoning boundary that use shall at the time of development provide onehalf of the buffer which is required by the tables of required buffer yards 2 the second use to develop shall at the time it develops provide all additional plant material andor land necessary to provide the total buffer yard required between those 2 uses if the adjoining use had developed without a buffer yard the second use will be responsible for installing the total buffer yard 3 existing plant material andor land located on the preexisting first developed land use which meets the requirements of this be counted as contributing to the total buffer yard required between it and the second adjacent land use to develop tables of required buffer yards required bufferyards between

the required buffer yard will obstruct the view of a driver or that the buffer yard is incompatible with the existing streetscape ownership of buffer yards buffer yards may remain in the ownership of the original developer and assigns of a land use or they may be subjected to deed restrictions and subsequently be freely conveyed or they may be transferred to any consenting grantees such as adjoining landowners the town of perryville or a homeowners association provided that any such conveyance adequately guarantees the protection of the buffer yards for the purposes of this ownership shall be specified and approved by the planning commission buffer yards which exceed minimum requirements where the buffer yard required between a land use and vacant land turns out to be greater than that buffer yard which is required between the first use and the subsequently developed use the following options apply 1 the subsequent use may provide one half of the buffer required by this existing use may expand its use into the original buffer area provided that the resulting total buffer yard between the two uses meets the buffer yard requirements of this zoning  the existing use may enter into agreements with abutting landowners to use its existing buffer to provide some or all of the required buffer yard of both land uses the total buffer shall equal the requirements of this that such an agreement can be negotiated the initial use may provide the second use some or all of its required buffer yard andor extra land on which it might develop the existing use may reduce its excess buffer by transferring part or all of the excess buffer to the adjoining landowner to serve as its buffer any remaining excess buffer area may be used by the existing use for expansion of that use or for transfer by it to the adjoining landowner to expand that adjoining use contractual reduction of buffer yards 1 when a land use is proposed adjacent to vacant land and the owner of that vacant land enters into a contractual relationship with the owner of the land that is to be developed first a reduced buffer may be provided by that first use provided that the contract contains a statement by the owner of the vacant land of an intent to develop at no greater than a specified land use intensity class  and an agreement by that vacant landowner to assume all responsibility for additional buffer if needed by the subsequent development of a less intense use than had been agreed upon is transferred to the owner of the vacant second in time to be developed land shading town findings and declaration of policy shade trees 1 the town finds that a trees are proven producers of oxygen a necessary element for human survival b trees appreciably reduce the ever increasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air we breathe c trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify the air much like the airwasher devices used on commercial air conditioning systems d trees have an important role in neutralizing waste water passing ground from the surface to ground water tables and lower aquifers e trees root systems stabilize the ground water tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation erosion control and flood control f trees are an invaluable physical aesthetic and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land reducing noise levels and glare and breaking the monotony of human developments on the land particularly parking areas and g for the reasons indicated herein trees have an important impact on the desirability of land and therefore on property values zoning  based upon the findings set forth in the town declares that it is not only desirable but essential to the health safety and welfare of all persons living or working within the towns planning jurisdiction to protect certain existing trees and under the circumstances set forth in this article to require the planting of new trees in certain types of developments required trees along dedicated streets along both sides of all newly created streets that are constructed in accordance with the perryville street standards the developer shall at a minimum either plant or retain sufficient trees so that between the paved portion of the street and a line running parallel to and fifty 50 feet from the centerline of the street there is for every fifty 50 feet of street frontage at least an average of one deciduous tree that has or will have when fully mature a trunk at least 12 inches in diameter retention and protection of large trees 1 every development shall retain all existing trees 18 inches in diameter or more unless the retention of such trees would unreasonably burden the development 2 no excavation or other subsurface disturbance may be undertaken within the drip line of any tree 18 inches in diameter or more and no impervious surface including but not limited to paving or buildings may be located within 12 feet measured from the center of the trunk of any tree 18 inches in diameter or more unless compliance with this subsection would unreasonably burden the development for purposes of this subsection a drip line is defined as a perimeter formed by the points farthest away from the trunk of a tree where precipitation falling from the branches of that tree lands on the ground 3 the retention or protection of trees 18 inches in diameter or more as provided in subsections 1 and 2 unreasonably burdens a developer if to accomplish such retention or protection the desired location of improvements on a lot or the proposed activities on a lot would have to be substantially altered and such alteration would work an unreasonable hardship upon the developer 4 if space that would otherwise be devoted to parking cannot be so used because of the requirements of subsections 1 or 2 and as a result the parking requirements set forth in cannot be satisfied the number of required spaces may be reduced by the number of spaces lost because of the provisions of subsections 1 and 2 up to a maximum of 15 percent of the required spaces landscape standards plan requirements for landscaping and screening 1 applicability a master landscaping plan or

seasons of the year 3 any applicant may incorporate and combine the mitigation requirements for meeting the provisions of the towns forest conservation act the chesapeake bay critical area program and the states nontidal wetlands act with these provisions the planning commission may approve such mitigation plans as a substitute for compliance with these conditions any plan may also use existing trees to count toward the requirements of these guidelines 4 whenever screening is required the following minimum screening materials may be used in any combination to accomplish the purpose and intent for which the screening is required the intent is to screen by 50% the visibility of adjoining property by the following means additional types of landscaping and screening materials or other
