purpose of implementing the provisions of of the environmental conservation law which provides for state environmental quality review seqr b the basic purpose of seqr is to incorporate environmental factors into the existing planning and decisionmaking processes of state regional and local agencies at the earliest possible time in adopting seqr it was the legislatures intention that all agencies conduct their affairs with an awareness that they are stewards of the air water land and living resources and that they have an obligation to protect the environment for the use and enjoyment of this and all future generations c it was the intention of the legislature that the protection and enhancement of the environment and of human and community resources should be given appropriate weight with social and economic  13119 environmental quality review  1351   1352 general provisions considerations in public policy and that those factors be considered together in reaching decisions on proposed activities accordingly it is the intention of these regulations that a suitable balance of social economic and environmental factors be incorporated in the planning and decisionmaking processes of state regional and local agencies  it is not the intention of seqr that environmental factors be the sole consideration in decisionmaking d the seqr process is designed to be integrated into existing agency procedures and should not result in delays in agency planning and decisionmaking by eliminating existing information gaps the seqr process should expedite agency decisionmaking and assist agencies in making more informed decisions e seqr also performs the following functions 1 it is an appropriate vehicle for expediting administrative review by consolidating and coordinating existing multiple approval procedures of public agencies which are often overlapping and sometimes fraught with delay thereby saving time and money this approach will encourage the establishment where possible of a onestop permit review process 2 it serves the peoples right to have information about and to participate in government planning and decisionmaking f this chapter provides a broad statewide framework for seqr implementation however seqr does not deprive any state agency or local government of its existing jurisdiction or authority nor does seqr authorize the department or any other agency to review andor approve actions by other public agencies under  13510 of this chapter state agencies and local governments in recognition of their differing needs priorities and responsibilities shall adopt their own rules procedures criteria and guidelines consistent with this chapter but tailored to their individual requirements a each agency shall establish procedures for determining whether or not an action under consideration will require an environmental impact statement on the basis of whether that action may have a significant effect on the environment and shall provide public notice of the determination in accordance with  1357 of this chapter if the action under consideration involves an applicant such determination shall be made within 15 calendar days following the filing of a complete application b following a determination that an action under consideration may have a significant effect on the environment the agency considering such action shall immediately notify the applicant in writing of its determination and except where the action involves more than one  1351 jamestown code  1352  agency shall request the applicant to prepare a draft environmental impact statement in accordance with  1356 of this chapter if the applicant declines to prepare the statement the agency shall prepare it or cause its preparation to be undertaken the procedures set forth in  1357 and 1358 of this chapter shall be followed except that 1 if such action may involve major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment under the national environmental policy act of 196 then the procedures set forth in  1353 of this chapter shall be followed  or 2 if such action may involve actions by other agencies then the procedures set forth in  1354 of this chapter shall be followed c following a determination that an action under the consideration may have a significant effect on the environment no agency shall approve commence or engage in such action until the national environmental policy act of 1969 procedures have been followed see  1353 of this chapter or the lead agency procedures have been followed see  1354 of this chapter or the seqr environmental impact statement and decisionmaking procedures have been followed see  1357 and 1358 of this chapter whichever one of such procedures is applicable nothing in this chapter shall prevent an agency or an applicant from 1 conducting contemporaneous environmental engineering economic feasibility and other studies and preliminary planning and budgetary processes necessary to the formulation of a proposal for action which do not otherwise commit the agency to commence or engage in such action  or 2 granting approval of any part of an application which relates only to technical specifications and requirements provided that no such partial approval shall entitle or permit the applicant to commence the action unless and until all requirements of this chapter have been fulfilled d agencies should identify programs or categories of actions which would most appropriately serve as the subject of a single environmental impact statement broad program statements master or areawide statements or statements for comprehensive plans are often appropriate to assess the environmental effects of a number of separate actions in a given geographic area a chain of contemplated actions separate actions having generic or common impacts or programs or plans having wide application or restricting the range of future alternative policies or projects such statements will eliminate multiple sequential reviews of the same or similar actions no further environmental impact statements need be prepared for actions which are included in such a statement agencies preparing such a statement shall develop procedures for amending or supplementing such statements to reflect impacts which are not addressed or adequately analyzed in such a statement as initially prepared such procedures  1352 environmental quality review  1352   1353 actions involving federal participation  1354 actions involving more than one agency shall include provisions for informing the public and other agencies of the preparation of such amendments or supplements and for allowing comment thereon before incorporation of such amendments or supplements in said statement actions undertaken or approved in conformity with this chapter prior to the incorporation of such amendments shall require no further review under this chapter a where there has duly been prepared under the national environmental policy act of 1969 both a draft environmental impact statement and a final environmental impact statement for an action under consideration the agency shall have no obligation to prepare an environmental impact statement or make findings under this chapter with respect to the action so long as the environmental impact statements either contain or are supplemented by the item concerning growthinducing aspects and energy use and conservation listed in  1356d7 and 8 of this chapter b where there has duly been prepared under the national environmental policy act of 1969 a negative declaration or other written threshold determination that the action will not require a federal impact statement the agency shall determine whether or not the action may have a significant effect on the environment pursuant to of the environmental conservation law and this chapter a when an action which may have a significant effect on the environment involves more than one agency all involved agencies shall to the fullest extent possible coordinate their environmental reviews lead agency to the end that the requirements of this chapter are met by a single draft environmental impact statement a single final environmental impact statement and if conducted and practicable a single hearing process in order to expedite this coordination agencies should require applicants to specify in their applications which other agencies to the best of their knowledge will have jurisdiction by law over proposed actions b upon receipt of a complete application for an action which an agency determines may have a significant effect on the environment the agency shall immediately notify all other agencies which may be involved in the proposed action and request full coordination of the environmental review of such action the designation of the lead agency shall be made within 30 calendar days following the filing of a complete application c in the case of an action involving an applicant the lead agency shall immediately notify the applicant in writing that it is the lead agency and request the applicant to prepare a draft environmental impact statement  1352 jamestown code  1354  d if a question arises between or among two or more agencies as to which agency is the lead agency the agencies shall resolve the question themselves and designate a lead agency in writing on the basis of the following 1 the agency to first act on the proposed action 2 a determination of which agency has the greatest responsibility for supervising or approving the action as a whole 3 a determination of which agency has more general governmental powers as compared to single or limited powers or purposes 4 a determination of which agency has the greatest capability for providing the most thorough environmental assessment of the action 5 a determination of whether the anticipated impacts of the action being considered are primarily of statewide regional or local concern eg if such impacts are primarily of local concern the local agency should be the lead agency e if such agencies are unable to resolve the question within the prescribed thirtycalendarday period they shall submit the question in written form to the commissioner who shall within five business days on the basis of the criteria specified above designate the lead agency f the other agencies involved in the action shall have no further obligation under this chapter with respect to the action being considered except 1 to provide their views where appropriate and to the extent practical appropriate technical analysis and support 2 to make the findings required by  1358 of this chapter 3 not to approve commence or engage in such action until the procedures set forth in  1357 and 1358 of this chapter have been completed g nothing in this chapter shall prevent an agency or an applicant from 1 conducting contemporaneous environmental engineering economic feasibility and other studies and preliminary planning and budgetary processes necessary to the formulation of a proposal for action which do not otherwise commit the agency to commence or engage in such action  or 2 granting approval of any part of an application which relates only to technical specifications and requirements provided that no such partial approval shall entitle or permit the applicant to commence the action unless and until all requirements of this chapter have been fulfilled  1354 environmental quality review  1355   1355 actions previously undertaken  1356 contents of environmental impact statement a except as provided in of this section no environmental impact statement shall be required for actions undertaken or approved prior to the effective dates of of the environmental conservation law b if after the effective dates of of the environmental conservation law an agency proposes to modify an action undertaken or approved prior to such dates such modification shall be an action fully subject to this chapter a environmental impact statements should be clearly written in a brief and concise manner capable of being read and understood by the public within the framework presented in of this section such statements should deal only with the specific significant environmental impacts which can be reasonably anticipated they should not contain more detail than is appropriate considering the nature and magnitude of the proposed action the significance of its potential impacts and the existing resources and capability of the agency responsible for the statement b all draft and final environmental impact statements shall be preceded by a cover sheet stating the following 1 whether it is a draft or final 2 the name or other descriptive title of the action 3 the location county and town village or city of the action 4 the name and address of the agency which required its preparation and the name and telephone number of a person at the agency to be contacted for further information 5 identification of individuals or organizations which prepared any portion of the statement 6 the date of its completion c if a draft or final environmental impact statement exceeds 10 pages in length it shall have a table of contents following the cover sheet d the body of all draft and final environmental impact statements shall at least contain the following 1 a description of the proposed action and its environmental setting 2 a statement of the environmental impact of the proposed action including its short and longterm effects and typical associated environmental effects  1355 jamestown code  1356   1357 environmental impact statement procedures 3 an identification of any adverse environmental effect which cannot be avoided if the proposed action is implemented 4 a discussion of alternatives to the proposed action and the comparable impacts and effects of such alternatives 5 an identification of any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented 6 a description of mitigation measures proposed to minimize the adverse environmental impacts 7 a description of any growthinducing aspects of the proposed action 8 a discussion of the effects of the proposed action on the use and conservation of energy 9 a list of any underlying studies reports and other information obtained and considered by the agency in preparing the statement 10 for final only copies or a summary of the substantive comments received in response to the draft environmental impact statement and the agencys response to such comments e an environmental impact statement may incorporate by reference all or portions of other documents which contain information relevant to the statement the referenced document shall be made available to the public in the same places where the agency makes available copies of the statement when a statement uses incorporation by reference the referenced document shall be briefly described and its date of preparation provided a an environmental impact statement represents a mechanism which aids agencies in giving meaningful consideration to environmental factors and facilitates the weighing of social economic and environmental issues in planning and decisionmaking therefore the preparation of such statements should be integrated into existing agency decisionmaking processes and occur at the same time as other agency reviews are being undertaken since the environmental impact review process is not a separate procedure to be added at the end of existing procedures it should not extend the time required for agency decisionmaking b when an action under consideration by an agency is not an exempt action a ministerial action an action listed as a type ii action in  13512 or on the agencys own list of actions found not to have a significant effect on the environment such agency upon determining whether the action may or will not have a significant effect on the  1356 environmental quality review  1357  environment shall immediately file such determination as follows with the appropriate regional office of the department  and with the commissioner  and in the case of a local agency board district commission or governing body city county or other political subdivision of the state in the office of the municipal clerk whose jurisdiction most closely corresponds with the agency  or in the case of a state department agency board publicbenefit corporation public authority or commission in the main office of such agency in addition individual agency procedures shall provide for further public notice of determinations as shall afford the opportunity for public response by such means as uptodate files in agency offices signboards or other appropriate means c where the action under consideration involves an applicant the agency may require the applicant to submit an environmental impact report to assist the agency in carrying out its responsibility under this chapter or may request the applicant to prepare the environmental impact statements required by this chapter an agency may request additional data and information from an applicant or other sources at any time it determines they are needed to comply adequately with seqr notwithstanding any use of outside sources and work agencies shall make their own independent judgment of an environmental impact statement and shall take responsibility for its scope contents and adequacy d each agency which requests an applicant to prepare or prepares a draft environmental impact statement shall upon its completion issue a notice of completion containing the following 1 a brief description of the action covered by the statement and the location of its potential impacts and effects 2 a statement indicating where and how copies of the statement can be obtained from the agency 3 a statement that comments on the statement are requested and will be received and considered by the agency at a given address for a period not less than 30 calendar days

that of the lead agency 2 one copy with the appropriate regional office of the department 3 one copy with the commissioner g each agency which requests an applicant to prepare or prepares a draft environmental impact statement shall upon its completion determine whether or not to conduct a public hearing concerning the action in determining whether or not to hold a hearing each agency should consider the degree of interest shown by other persons in the action and the extent to which a public hearing can aid in agency decisionmaking processes by providing a forum for or an efficient mechanism for the collection of public comment 1 if a hearing is to be held notice thereof may be contained in the notice of completion or if not so contained shall be given in the same manner in which the notice of completion is sent filed and circulated pursuant to subsections d and e of this section in either case the notice of hearing shall also be published at least 10 calendar days in advance of the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the potential impacts and effects of the action 2 the hearing shall commence not less than 15 calendar days nor more than 60 calendar days after the filing of the draft environmental impact statement pursuant to of this section except as the agency may otherwise provide where it determines that additional time is necessary for public or other agency review of the draft environmental impact statement or where a different hearing date is required as appropriate under applicable law when a seqr hearing is to be held it shall be incorporated into existing hearing procedures h except as provided in 1 and 2 below the lead agency shall prepare or cause to be prepared a final environmental impact statement within 45 calendar days after the close of any hearing or within 60 calendar days after the filing of the draft environmental impact statement whichever last occurs 1 if the proposed action has been withdrawn or if on the basis of the draft environmental impact statement or hearing the agency has determined that the action will not have a significant effect on the environment no final environmental impact statement need be prepared  1357 environmental quality review  1357   1358 decisionmaking  determinations 2 the agency may extend the last date for preparation of the final environmental impact statement a where it determines that additional time is necessary to complete the statement adequately  b where problems with the proposed action requiring material reconsideration or modification have been identified  or c for other good cause 3 the final environmental impact statement shall reflect a revision and updating of the matters contained in the draft

statements it has requested or prepared a no decision to carry out or approve an action which may have a significant effect on the environment shall be made until after the filing and consideration of a final environmental impact statement the lead agencys decision whether or not to approve an action which has been the subject of an environmental impact statement shall be made within 30 calendar days of the filing of a final environmental impact statement b when an agency decides to carry out or approve an action which may have a significant effect on the environment it shall make the following findings in a written determination 1 consistent with social economic and other essential consideration of state policy from among the reasonable alternatives thereto the action to be carried out or approved is one which minimizes or avoids adverse environmental effects to the maximum extent possible including the effects disclosed in the relevant environmental impact statement 2 consistent with social economic and other essential considerations of state policy all practicable means will be taken in carrying out or approving the action to minimize or avoid adverse environmental effects c for public information purposes a copy of the determination shall be filed immediately in the same manner as the draft environmental  1357 jamestown code  1358   1359 significantimpact criteria impact statement each agency shall maintain a file open to public inspection of notices of determinations prepared by it a an action may have significant effect on the environment if it can reasonably be expected to lead to one of the following consequences 1 a substantial adverse change to ambient air or water quality or noise levels or in solid waste production drainage erosion or flooding example reactivation of a heavy manufacturing plant 2 the removal or destruction of large quantities of vegetation or fauna the substantial interference with the movement of any resident or migratory fish or wildlife species impacts on critical habitat areas or the substantial affecting of a rare or endangered species of animal or plant or the habitat of such a species example clearcutting of a forested mountainside 3 the encouraging or attracting of a large number of people to a place or places for more than a few days relative to the number of people who would come to such place absent the action example acquisition of a large private lake for use as a public park 4 the creation of a material conflict with a communitys existing plans or goals as officially approved or adopted example construction of a jail in an area zoned by the local municipality for singlefamily residential use 5 the impairment of the character or quality of important historical archaeological architectural or aesthetic resources or of existing community or neighborhood character example demolition of a historical landmark listed in the statewide inventory of historical and cultural resources 6 a major change in the use of either the quantity or type of energy example an agency decision to centrally aircondition all its existing public buildings 7 the creation of a hazard to human health or safety example the manufacture or disposal by an agency of toxic substances 8 a substantial change in the use or intensity of use of land or other natural resources or in their capacity to support existing uses except where such a change has been included referred to or implicit in a broad statement prepared pursuant to  1352d of this chapter example construction of an airport 9 the creation of a material demand for other actions which would result in one of the above consequences  1358 environmental quality review  1359   13510 agency rulemaking  records 10 changes in two or more elements of the environment no one of which is substantial but when taken together result in a material change in the environment b for the purpose of determining whether an action will cause one of the foregoing consequences the action shall be deemed to include other contemporaneous or subsequent actions which are included in any longrange comprehensive integrated plan of which the action under consideration is a part which are likely to be undertaken as a result thereof or which are dependent thereon the significance of a likely consequence ie whether it is material substantial large important etc should be assessed in connection with its setting ie urban or rural its probability of occurring its duration its irreversibility its controllability its geographic scope and its magnitude ie the degree of change or its absolute size of this chapter contains lists of actions which are likely to have a significant effect on the environment and lists of actions which the commissioner has found not to have a significant effect on the environment a all agencies shall consistent with the provisions of of the environmental conservation law after public hearing adopt and publish such additional procedures as may be necessary for the implementation by them of this chapter this may be accomplished by the use of uniform procedures or adoption by reference of procedures applicable to other agencies b individual agencies are encouraged to develop their own criteria consistent with  1359 of this chapter and their own classification system whether or not in the form of  13512 of this chapter to cover the particular actions engaged in or reviewed by them such criteria and classification systems shall be no less protective of environmental values than this chapter individual agencies are also encouraged to develop a classification of actions which are ministerial actions and criteria for determining when actions are or are not ministerial c the procedures prescribed under this chapter shall to the greatest extent practicable be incorporated in and integrated with existing agency procedures and variance in form alone shall constitute no objection thereto such individual agency procedures however shall be no less protective of environmental values public participation and agency and judicial review than the procedures set forth in this chapter d upon the written request of any person the commissioner shall review and determine whether any action contained in an agencys own list or classification system similar to  13512 is consistent with the criteria of  1359 and the actions listed in  13512 of this chapter the commissioner shall give written notification of the determination to such persons and the agency within 30 days of receipt of a request  1359 jamestown code  13510   13511 fees and costs  13512 classification and lists of actions e such agency procedures shall provide for interagency working relationships in cases where actions typically involve more than one agency liaison with the public public notice requirements provision for public comment and such other procedures as may be required to effect the efficient and expeditious administration of this chapter procedures for administrative review of agency decision may also be incorporated in agency rules f all agencies shall review their present statutory authority administrative regulations and current policies and procedures for the purpose of determining whether there are any deficiencies or inconsistencies therein which prohibit or impede full compliance with this chapter agencies should examine time limits or schedules for actions hearing procedures public notice provisions standards for agency action which limit or exclude environmental factors provisions for environmental data gathering provisions for public participation in the decisionmaking process and procedures for and methods of reviewing environmental impact by  agencies shall recommend or effect such measures as may be necessary to bring their authority and policies into conformity with this chapter including statutory changes amendments to administrative regulations new standard forms revised instructions and procedural guidelines and improved personnel training g each agency shall maintain a file open to public inspection containing a list of all environmental impact statements prepared or under preparation by or at the request of such agency a where an action subject to this chapter involves an applicant the agency responsible for environmental impact statements may charge a fee not to exceed 12 of 1% of the actions total cost to the applicant in order to recover the costs of preparing and reviewing environmental impact statements b the technical services of each agency may be made available on a fee basis reflecting the costs thereof to other agencies and the fee charged to any applicant pursuant to of this section may reflect such costs c any such fees shall be computed and charged in accordance with the regulations adopted after public hearing by the charging agency pursuant to  13510 of this chapter a the purpose of this section is to simplify the task of determining whether or not a proposed action may have a significant effect on the environment by identifying for agencies actions or classes of actions that are likely to have a significant effect and those that will not have a  13510 environmental quality review  13512  significant effect because of the complex and varied nature of agency actions the lists in this section are not allinclusive the omission from the lists of an action does not mean that it is exempt from this chapter nor does it mean that it is automatically an action requiring environmental impact statement preparation the criteria set forth in  1359 of this chapter and criteria included in agency procedures under  13510 of this chapter shall be used to determine significance with respect to actions not listed in this section 1 the following classification system is used in this section a type i actions or classes of actions that are likely to require preparation of environmental impact statements because they will in almost every instance have a significant effect on the environment b type ii actions or classes of actions which have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which do not require environmental impact statements under this chapter 2 this chapter does not apply to actions by private persons where no nonministerial agency action is involved the following lists are intended to cover only actions of agencies or actions which must be approved funded or otherwise acted upon by an agency b type i 1 type i actions or classes of
