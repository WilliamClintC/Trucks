general provisions 611 short title 612 statement of findings  this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the bethel park stormwater management   the governing body of the municipality finds that 1 inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources 2 a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment 3 inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns  accelerating stream flows which increases scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation  destroying aquatic habitat  and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge 4 stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams 5 public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues 6 nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of the waters of the commonwealth 7 the use of green

sedimentation problems close to their source by regulating activities that cause these problems 3 preserve the natural drainage systems to the maximum extent possible 4 maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources 5 maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses 6 preserve and restore the floodcarrying capacity of streams and prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds 7 manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source with a minimum of structures and a maximum use of

regulations either unsatisfactory in the interest of the people at large or actually impossible it is not the ordinance but the physical conditions that prevent a lot from accommodating a type or area or bulk of structure unsuited to it for typical example it is not intended that each lot in a multiplefamily dwelling district automatically become the prospective site for a multiplefamily dwelling and use if a lot in such a district after provision of the yards and other spaces prescribed for its own and adjacent property protection has a buildable area too small in area or dimensions for a

development of the district area 4 the land within the district is substantially built out and will be fully developed and built out for the uses permitted under bethel parks zoning years 5 transportation facilities are not available within the district to support current and future institutional retail and commercial growth and development of the district 6 federal aid and available state county and local funding capabilities cannot meet the transportation needs of the district 7 balanced growth of bethel park including institutional commercial and commercial uses is imperative

functions 111 editors note for said preamble consult b on file in the municipal offices 112 editors note exhibit a is on file in the municipal offices 6936 general provisions 6936a  8 balanced growth will not be possible without the construction of the project 9 the studies prepared by trans associates including exhibit a hereto and david e wooster and associates provide a reasonable analysis and recommendation upon which among other things bethel park has been able to properly base its determination of the proper boundaries of the district 10 in addition to the studies bethel park used the experience of its council members as longtime residents of the area the recommendations of bethel park planning commission the location of streams wetlands and other natural and manmade features and the severe topography of certain areas to determine all properties having a substantial relationship to the proposed projects 11 the studies utilize sound engineering assumptions which established a rational cost allocation among parcel groups benefitted 12 the projects construction costs could change if different engineering assumptions were used but would result in essentially the same cost allocation among the benefitted properties 13 the studies were not utilized as the sole basis for the action to be taken hereby but as a guide to assist bethel park in arriving at the proper district boundaries 14 all property within the district will be benefitted by the project in direct proportion to the assessment imposed thereon hereby and as set forth in exhibit a hereto 15 the assessment formulas established in a6 hereof and exhibit a hereto are fair and reasonable and each benefitted property within the district will be subject to a fair and reasonable assessment upon imposition of the assessments as provided herein 16 the project is not for the purpose of maintaining or repairing an existing facility or facilities but represents the complete construction reconstruction acquisition installation widening or relocation of transportation infrastructure to remedy existing deficiencies and provide for the projected growth of traffic to the year 2015 17 all of the project provides new traffic capacity or will prevent roads currently safe but congested from becoming substandard and safety hazards due to projected traffic growth 18 the life of the improvements in the

authorized by the tpa must be free from legal challenge if bethel park is to rely on them as a dependable source of revenue 26 the issuance of general obligation debt requires the expenditure of substantial funds which would be unrecoverable if successful challenges occurred after the issuance of the same 27 a reduction in one property owners assessment might increase all other property owners assessments which could exceed the assessment limits set by the notice requirements of tpa 28 a method for challenging the district assessments or any other substantive provision of the district is required 29 the time to challenge any substantive aspect of the financing for the district must be limited and should expire prior to the issuance of public debt or the expenditure of substantial unrecoverable funds 30 an appeals process should be instituted which must limit repetitive and timeconsuming appeals by multiple property owners 31 the appeals process should be inexpensive and open to all property owners who will be assessed regardless of the size of the assessment 32 the appeals process should be structured so as not to overburden the courts with multiple and repetitive appeals 113 editors note see 53 ps  1621 et seq 6936a general provisions 6936a  33 the time for an aggrieved person to appeal should be restricted so that any such appeals can be consolidated and heard by the court in an expeditious fashion 34 the issuance of general obligation debt independent of the district but consistent with the myp pursuant to the debt the advancement of a portion or all of the same to the district after the formation of the district will result in a savings in longterm interest and debt issuance charges and shall result in lower special benefit
