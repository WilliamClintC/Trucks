into public or private sewers connected to the towns potw shall comply with applicable federal requirements and state standards for pretreatment of wastes as they may be amended from time to time in addition to the requirements of this numerical discharge limitations established by the town as set forth herein or may be added in the future referred to as local limits all state pretreatment standards and federal categorical pretreatment standards shall apply whichever is most stringent in developing the list of pollutants of concern for which local limits are established the town has considered the allowable headworks loading at the wastewater treatment facility pollutants that exceed fifty percent 50% of their allowable headworks loading at the wastewater treatment facility are considered to be of concern and have resulted in development of local limits if any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the potw that exceed the standards or restrictions established in 4 and 25 of this which inthe judgment of the superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon the potw processes equipment or receiving waters or that otherwise create a

limitations are established to protect against passinterference  the superintendent shall calculate and administer daily concentration limits ie local limits when required as described below to ensure that the combined industrial pollutant discharge loadings do not cause or contribute to exceedences of these limitations for industrial discharge applications the local limits shall apply at the end of the process train prior to dilution with nonindustrial wastewaters daily concentrations are the concentration of a pollutant discharged determined from the analysis of a flowcomposited sample or other sampling procedure approved by the superintendent representative of the discharge over the duration of a 24hour day or industrial operating schedule of less than 24 hours all concentration limits for metals represent total metal unless indicated otherwise the superintendent may impose mass limitations in addition to or in accordance with in place of the concentrationbased limitations local limits are developed based on the identification of industrial users known to be discharging each pollutant industrial contributory flow procedure unless specifically identified in an industrial discharge permit an industrial user shall not discharge the locally limited pollutants at concentrations 20 percent greater than the background concentrations used for local limits development b screening levels the following pollutants shall not be discharged to the potw exceeding concentrations listed below without approval of the superintendent municipality may develop and include list or

organicsolids loadings or worker health and safety if any of the screening levels are exceeded repeat analysis shall be performed to verify compliance or noncompliance with that screening level ifnoncompliance is confirmed then the industrial user shall be required at the discretion of the superintendent to conduct an appropriate engineering evaluation to determine the potential impact of the discharge of this pollutant to the towns potw or alternatively to develop a pollution prevention plan specifically addressing the pollutant that exceeds the screening level this study or plan must be conducted under the supervision and approval of the town should the evaluation indicate the impact to be unsatisfactory the industrial user shall reduce the pollutant concentration to a satisfactory level if the evaluation supports development of an alternate sitespecific limitation then the screening level shall be adjusted and administered as a limit for the specific discharge c special agreements no statement contained in this for paragraphs 23a 23b and 24 shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the town and any industrial user whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the town for treatment provided that said agreements do not contravene any requirements of existing federal or state laws andor regulations promulgated thereunder are compatible with any user charge system in effect and do not waive applicable federal categorical pretreatment standards special agreement requests shall require submittal of a pollution prevention plan that specifically addresses the discharge for which a special agreement is requested for pollutants with numerical local limits the town may allocate a percentage of its allowable industrial loadings for such special agreements requests for special agreements that exceed this allocation will not be approved 26 towns right of revision the discharge standards and requirements set forth in 4 and 25 are established for the purpose of preventing discharges to the potw that would harm the sewers wastewater treatment process or equipment  would have an adverse effect on the receiving stream  or would otherwise endanger lives limb public property or constitute a nuisance to meet these objectives the superintendent may from time to time review and set more stringent standards or requirements than those established in 4 and 25 if in the superintendents opinion such more stringent standards or requirements are necessary at a minimum this review will be performed at least once every five years in forming this opinion the superintendent may give consideration to such factors as the quantity of waste in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers materials of construction of the sewers the wastewater treatment process employed capacity of the wastewater treatment facility degree of treatability at the wastewater treatment facility pollution prevention activities and other pertinent factors the limitations or restrictions on materials or characteristics of waste or wastewaters discharged to the sanitary sewer shall not be

superintendent may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate 28 massbased limitations users implementing process changes may request that compliance be determined based on mass limitations in lieu of concentration limitations such massbased limitations will be calculated from the permitted concentrationbased limitations and flows and shall be equivalent to or less than the mass discharge in effect at the time of the request the intent of a massbased limit is to encourage and allow pollution prevention andor water conservation measures that might cause a facility to increase pollutant concentrations in its discharge even though the total mass of the pollutant discharged does not increase and may in fact decrease decisions on granting requests for massbased compliance limitations will be based on userspecific information and current operating conditions of the potw and will be at the discretion of the superintendent implementation of massbased limitations may not contravene any requirements of federal or state laws andor
