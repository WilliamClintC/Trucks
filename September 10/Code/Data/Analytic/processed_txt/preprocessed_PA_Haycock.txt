statement of community development goals and objectives shall serve as a guideline for growth and development within the municipalities participating in the quakertown area comprehensive plan and the quakertown area zoning municipalities are haycock township milford township richland township quakertown borough richlandtown borough and trumbauersville borough _ quakertown borough which participates in the comprehensive planning program has enacted a separate zoning ordinance this statement is in compliance with the requirements of of the pennsylvania municipalities planning growth management growth is a dominant factor  in land use and community planning for the quakertown area many problems and demands which face these municipalities and the school district are generated as direct or indirect results of the location timingand magnitude of growth pressures for continued development are regional in scale current residents travel throughout the philadelphia metropolitan area as well as to new jersey and new york for employment growth must be balanced with preservation of natural and manmade environments the type and intensity of new development must be guided and coordinated with a full range of facilities and services decisions must include considerations of timing location character and magnitude of new and changing uses metropolitan areas like the quakertown area continue to grow although migration from rural areas to urban areas is no longer as large as it was in previous decades there are however other important migration trends within urban areas and from one urban area to another there is migration from central cities to the urban fringe people seek more desirable living environments it is clear that the desires of a large segment of the population do not match with the present location of these individuals or the quality of life that they desire for their families it is this pressure which is the major component of growth in the quakertown area the quakertown area lies at the fringe of two metropolitan areas the philadelphia metropolitan area and the allentownbethlehemeaston metropolitan area growth is encouraged by the location of the quakertown area on highways between the two areas there is much discussion regarding the desirability and need for controlling growth and there are strong reasons to support a policy for such regulations the first is ecological we have come to realize that environmental destruction accompanies uncontrolled urban development and we have been less than successful in limiting these adverse environmental impacts in the past the second set of reasons is economic for years the public has challenged the bigger is better philosophy we have reached the point of understanding where rising costs for schools and services from police to garbage collection are being associated with the process of growth growth does not automatically bring benefits to the municipality in fact uncontrolled poorly planned growth can be associated with increased municipal and school district costs a critical area of concern that any policy attempting to direct or control growth must take into account is how the growth is regulated stated more precisely who is affected by growth or by attempts to control growth past policies intended to slow down or retard growth such as municipalitywide large lot zoning have accomplished little even during periods where the zoning is clearly restrictedpermitting development only on large lotswe have seen little indication of a slowing of development it is obvious however that in areas of largelot zoning the growth that did take place was limited to a specific socio economic group those who could pay higher costs of housing in lowdensity 3 singlefamily houses side effects of a lowintensity zoning policy have been to further encourage urban sprawl and a failure to provide any substantial degree of environmental protection any future policy that attempts to control growth must deal effectively with the problem of exclusion in setting up a policy to direct growth we must provide associated policies which guarantee that such controls will not be exclusionary goal to guide the form location and timing of growth in order to protect the natural environment enhance the manmade environment and establish living and working environments that are properly provided with a full range of services and facilities within appropriate portions of the quakertown area objectives 1 to recognize that a certain amount of growth is inevitable and imminent it is the intent of the comprehensive plan and the zoning ordinance ta provide areas sufficient to accommodate the anticipated need far a variety of housing types and densities and far nanresidentiai uses for the 1990 to 2000 period  2 to direct mare intensive residential and nonresidential development into development areas where supportive services and facilities can be economically and efficiently provided 3 ta limit development in reserve areas ta law intensity rural uses where supportive services and facilities cannot or should not be provided at this time 4 ta recognize that other than areas used or intended far higher density housing and intensive nonresidential uses the quakertown area is essentially rural or semirural in character planning efforts shall protect this  character while providing far anticipated new development in appropriate locations 5 6 7 8 9 10 ta ensure that land designated for mare intensive residential and nonresidential uses are areas currently served or which are intended ta be served by infrastructure to base any further expansion of higher density residential or nonresidential areas on demonstrated need for expansion and on specific and committed improvements in infrastructure to recognize that responsibility for improvements to the quakertown areas road system is shared by municipalities the commonwealth and developers to develop programs and procedures that will coordinate the provision for all infrastructure to coordinate provision of services with new development and to take steps to bring existing deficiencies in services and facilities up to meet needs of current residents  to recognize that changes in federal and state funding programs have decreased funds available for services and facilities at a time of increased demand due ta the rate and magnitude of development and to develop new methods of funding services and facilities to meet needs of current and future residents 4 b environmental protection open space and historic preservation we have come to realize that man is an inseparable part of the environment where man takes an action intended to improve the quality of his life whether it be the development of a farm subdivision or shopping center we now recognize that there will be environmental impacts many of which will be adverse because we operate in a closed ecological system adverse environmental impacts eventually feed back system and affect the quality of life water pollution soil erosion and pesticides are all examples of such impacts within the system we may look upon the environment as a common or public good an environment of high quality is deserved and desired by all the environment to be protected is both natural and manmade and its protection involves many considerations of the pennsylvania constitution guarantees all citizens the right to clean air pure water and the preservation of natural scenic tiistorlc and aesthetic values of the environment municipalities have the responsibility of protecting natural features of the landscape and providing for open space under the provisions of the pennsylvania municipalities planning constitution and the code form the basis for open space requirements and municipal environmental regulations in exercising this  responsibility municipalities must balance the rights of the public to environmental protection with individual property rights the built environment also deserves protection this includes the character of residential neighborhoods and the municipalitys historic resources goal to protect the peoples right to clean air pure water and the other natural and historic resources of our environment and to guarantee a quality environment for present and future residents in the quakertown area objectives i to protect specific natural features of the landscape resource standards incorporated in zoning and subdivisionland development ordinances 2 to conserve the quakertown areas groundwater supply facilities planning water resources planning effective stormwater management enforcement of sound development standards and promotion of proper site design 3 to require evaluation of environmental impacts of certain planning zoning and development decisions and to minimize adverse environmental impacts design and proper planning 4 to ensure proper collection treatment and disposal of wastewater and to remedy conditions where pollution exists water supplies must be husbanded and protected from contamination and depletion to achieve this water that eventually becomes effluent should be used when feasible to recharge the groundwater resources 5 to require usable open space in intensive residential developments that is adaptable for active and passive recreation 6 to support state and federal programs that result in the continuation of open space in the municipalities 5 7 to support efforts that will protect and enhance historic structures and areas of the quakertown area 8 to protect the character and enhance the quality of quakertown areas villages land planning techniques and ordinance standards 9 to foster state and national registration of structures and sites that are of historic significance and to protect by similar means the immediate area surrounding these landmarks c residential development continued residential development must be coupled with the necessary expansion of a full range of services and facilities a variety of housing types at appropriate densities to meet the needs and desires of a broad population should be permitted in various areas  in addition to a variety of housing types and densities a diversity of housing prices will meet needs of current and future residents of the quakertown area although development standards and review procedures have some affect on housing prices the national economy policies of major financial institutions and developers market strategies and profit expectations are the primary and controlling factors that affect the final price of a house affordable housing will require cooperative efforts of private industry as well as various levels of government in any such effort affordable housing must be structurally sound attractive and integrated with more conventional housing to avoid social stratification of neighborhoods goal to promote adequate safe and sound housing for present and future residents regardless of socioeconomic characteristics objectives 1 to ensure that the zoning ordinance provides for a variety of housing types and that sufficient land is designated for higher density use to accommodate a fair share of regional housing growth between 1990 and 2000 2 to incorporate appropriate design and improvement requirements in subdivision and land development ordinances to ensure safe and healthy residential environments 3 to adopt flexible site development requirements and to encourage use of cost effective technology and materials 4 to provide the low and moderate income housing density bonuses in zoning ordinances in order to encourage developers to produce more affordable housing 5 to permit mixed land uses which could provide opportunity for more affordable housing 6 to permit emergency shelter facilities and group homes in appropriate areas 7 to permit accessory apartments in residential areas for elderly and disabled relatives 6 8 to encourage efforts to preserve and rehabilitate existinghousing stock {9 to require evaluation of zoning change requests to determine the impact on the mix of housing opportunities and accommodation of a fair share of regional housing growth {1o to ensure that new higher density residential development is located in areas with needed and desired infrastructure 11 to ensure that overall new residential development includes a variety of housing types and intensities to provide for balance and diversity in the housing stock 12 to cooperate with private efforts to provide affordable housing that is attractive structurally sound and integrated into the community 13 to encourage use of cluster and mixed residential forms of development to protect vulnerable natural features provide for open space permit better site design increase housing opportunities and minimize site development costs d nonresidential development a balanced variety of land uses is important for the quakertown area residential and nonresidential uses complement each other nonresidential uses provide employment shopping and service opportunities for the residents residents provide a portion <if the labor force and local markets although nonresidential uses place burdens on the road system and other services these uses generate revenues for municipalities the school district and municipal authorities decisions related to the expansion of any commercial office or industrial zoning district should be made on locational considerations as well as the need for additional capacity as determined by the municipal officials these considerations would include proper access road capacity including existing traffic traffic generated by the proposed development other developments in the area and background traffic growth availability of sewer and water services and compatibility with surrounding land uses programs to improve conditions in areas where improvement is warranted should be encouraged and supported where such programs are initiated and funded by nonresidential property owners developers and businessmen goal to support and encourage nonresidential developments compatible with the essentially residential character of the municipalities and which have minimal impact on the highway network and other services and to encourage improvement programs in appropriate areas objectives 1 to encourage concentration of convenience retail uses at selected areas near residential developments 2 to discourage strip commercial development {3 to permit industrial and commercial uses in designated areas with due regard for protection of neighboring land uses 7 4 to require high standards to control nuisances such as objectionable odors noise smoke and hazardous material of any kind 5 to encourage high quality office commercial and industrial development 6 to concentrate nonresidential development in areas zoned for such uses and which contain adequate water sewer drainage and highway facilities 7 to require full evaluation of requests to expand nonresidential areas in order to determine the impacts on municipal services highway network and natural features of the landscape 8 to support encourage and assist joint efforts of nonresidential property owners developers and businessmen to improve conditions in commercial and industrial areas 9 to foster continued use and revitalization of the quakertown borough center as an area of compatible mixed uses which are typical of a traditional town center e recreation facilities recreation is an important part of a persons life as an individual and a member of the community active recreation improves physical well being develops skills and confidence and teaches team work passive recreation brings an appreciation of the natural environment recreation facilities are key components of the quality of life in the quakertown area goal to provide recreational opportunities including active and passive recreation facilities for municipal residents of all ages objectives 1 to implement park and recreation plans in municipalities that have prepared and formally adopted such plans and to encourage preparation of park and recreation plans in other municipalities 2 to cooperate among participating municipalities and the school district to avoid the unnecessary duplication of facilities 3 to revise the quakertown area linked open space study so that links would be located adjacent to collector roads where appropriate 4 to refer to the quakertown area linked open space study during review of subdivisions and land development proposals and discuss with developers incorporation of identified links into development plans 5 to recognize that in rapidly growing areas such as the quakertown area that open space parks and recreation facilities are important improvements and are vital aspects of any development proposal for these improvements and fees to provide municipalscale facilities are appropriate methods of addressing recreational needs of the quakertown area such requirements under the provisions of 11 of the pennsylvania municipalities planning should be included in municipal subdivision and land development ordinances 8 f sewage facilities  water facilities sewer and water systems are two critical elements needed to support more intensive residential and nonresidential development where soils are suitable for the renovation of effluent onsite services are adequate to serve lowdensity rural forms of development sewer and water services should be considered utility resources with limited capacities expansion of these services in terms of capacities should be based on projected need expansion of service areas should be a logical progression from areas of existing services into areas where other needed infrastructure exists or is planned to be located premature extension of services beyond such areas diminishes the capability to plan for and provide other needed services and to achieve environmental protection land use and growth management goals goal to use sewer and water services as methods of implementing housing projections and land use goals included in the comprehensive plan update objectives 1 to base sewer and water facilities planning capacities and service areas on projections and land use goals of the comprehensive plan and guidelines of the municipal sewage facilities plan act 537 2 to coordinate expansion of these services with planning for all critical infrastructure 3 to ensure that in efforts to recharge groundwater resources the quality of water is acceptable 4 to affirm that uses permitted under this zoning ordinance are based on goals and land use guidelines included in the comprehensive plan as well as changing municipal needs as identified by elected officials and planning commissions and that access to sewer and water facilities does not justify a change in land use g highway network the relationship between the highway network and land use is strong and direct the road system plays a role in influencing overall growth within the quakertown area and development of individual properties a good highway network _not only provides access to homes work shopping and recreation but also provides a means for business and industry to acquire materials and to reach their markets conversely land use can directly impact the ability of highways to function intense land uses directed to roadways that are not designed to accommodate large traffic volumes or to roadways with limited capacity due to current use will have detrimental impacts on the road improper matching of intensive land uses and limited capacity roads will slow the flow of traffic and result in hazardous conditions an inefficient use of the publics investment in the highways will also result traffic conditions to a large degree result from the quakertown areas location in the greater region much of the traffic passes area and has neither local origins nor destinations growth in the surrounding greater region adds traffic to the road network traffic would increase in the quakertown area even in the improbable event that development would end 9 goal to protect maintain and improve the carrying capacity o1 the quakertown areas highway network and to make improvements that will eliminate or avoid hazardous conditions objectives 1 to enhance specific standards criteria and procedures for traffic impact analysis in land use ordinances and to require an evaluation of the impact on the capacity of the road system for conditional uses special exceptions and zoning change requests 2 to evaluate the impact on the road system to identify needed offsite improvements and to avoid hazardous conditions for major subdivisions and land developments 3 4 5 6 to develop a capital improvements program for needed highway improvements to develop funding programs whereby costs of needed improvements are shared by municipalities the commonwealth adjacent municipalities and developers to implement the quakertown area traffic analysis of 1987 to undertake an environmental impact study which will identify alternative solutions to the traffic congestion in the quakertown area 7 to participate in efforts to improve the routes 313663 corridor central and upper parts of bucks county b to cooperate with public agencies or private interest groups in efforts to establish public transportation systems or transportation management associations to reduce pressure on the road system h municipal and school district services demands for municipal and school district services and improvements have increased with development the disappearance o1 state and federal programs and changing requirements of commonwealth statutes the municipallties and school district will provide needed services and construct desired facilities on a financially responsible basis goal to provide needed and desired services within constraints of fiscal abillties objectives 1 to strengthen the tax base by encouraging the development of a variety o1 complementary nonresidential uses in appropriate locations 2 to cooperate in the management of solid waste with bucks county and other participating municipalities under act 101 of 1988 3 to avoid duplication of facilities and procurement of materials with surrounding municipalities 4 to require that developers contribute a fair share o1 costs of new services and facilities that result from rapid growth in the quakertown area 10 5 to identify areas where new school sites may be needed and work with developers to reserve these site for future school uses i haycock township it is recognized that the rate of growth in haycock township has been slow and the amount has been small the character of the community is rural human settlements are small villages services which foster urban or suburban development are nonexistent large land areas are owned by the state and county governments and are set aside for park recreation and conservation purposes small farms exist where the terrain is not steep heavily forested scattered with boulders or covered with wetland or floodplain soils in fact much of haycock township has physical limitations much more severe than other portions of the quakertown area it is recognized that haycock township is not in the path of development however the legislature of the commonwealth of pennsylvania has placed certain responsibilities on the township government as specified in the pennsylvania municipalities planning as amended related to the accommodation cf reasonable land uses the townships planning and zoning efforts have balanced these responsibilities with the unique character and limitations of the community goal to maintain the rural character of haycock township and to meet the land use planning responsibilities as mandated by the commonwealth of pennsylvania objectives 1 to designate an adequate amount of land for all necessary housing types amj in a sufficient amount to provide for a fair share of the regional housing growth based on bucks county projections 2 to designate appropriate areas for nonresidential land uses which will have minimal impact on the community 3 to protect the unique natural features

at the end of a fifteen 15 139 minute period and that there shall be at least as many observations as there are decibels between the lowest low indication and highest high indication 6 calculate the arithmetical average of the observed central tendency indications this is the sound level of the ambient sound plus the sound source total sound leveq 7 if the difference between the ambient sound and the sound source is 1odba or greater the measured sound level is an accurate measurement of the sound source this value should be compared to the permitted sound levels in table 1 8 due to the

layout and roadway connections the street system within the village expansion overlay district shall be designed to connect new developments with each other and with the existing village or town a grid pattern 157 provides the best means of maximizing connections between developments it is recommended that a grid pattern be utilized in new developments to the greatest extent possible potential primary roads and secondary street connections are shown on illustrations a and b new primary streets are important to provide better circulation throughout the village or town as it expands secondary street connections link neighborhoods and strengthen the sense of community these proposed roads and connections are not exact locations but are intended to illustrate approximate locations of new streets it is recommended that landownersdevelopers incorporate these proposed primary roads and secondary street connections or a similar design into any future development of their site design gujdelines the following design guidelines are recommendations which should be considered for any development proposed in the village expansion overlay district although only recommendations every effort should be made to follow the suggested guidelines so that future development enhances and extends the character of adjacent villages and towns  a mix of residential usesln keeping with the character of villages and towns future developments in the overlay district should be encourageli to provide a mix of residential types also dwelling types should be integrated throughout the developments so as to avoid any segregation of uses within defined areas of the development the goal should be to have all permitted residential types interspersed throughout the area b architectural considerationsto the fullest extent possible architectural elements such as porches balconies roof types walls and fences shall be characteristic of existing architectural elements in the village or town this carryover effect of such architectural elements will help achieve the primary goal of the village expansion overlay district which is to allow development to occur adjacent to the village or town while still protecting the character and identity of the original village or town c garageswherever possible garages should be detached from the dwelling unit and located in the rear of the lots with possible access from an alley or private drive often a distinguishing element of older villages and towns detached garages help foster a sense of diversity of structures throughout the area d pedestrian accesspedestrian access should be an important design element in any development proposed adjacent to villages and towns villages and towns usually contain a variety of uses due to this unique character linkages such as walkways and sidewalks should be provided to connect the development with the village or town to encourage pedestrian access e alleysalleys where feasible are encouraged for future developments in this area alleys can be an effective method of providing access to the rear of residential lots for service and onlot parking an additional advantage of utilizing alleys is that they would help to alleviate pressures for onstreet parking procedures the village expansion overlay district provisions may be used only after the granting of conditional use approval

forested buffer appendix c plant lists for wetland management appendix d stormwater management plan application and fee schedule appendix e watershed map article 1 general provisions statement of findings the governing body of the municipality finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation degrades water quality overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment purpose the purpose of this comprehensive stormwater management ordinance is to promote health safety and welfare within haycock township by minimizing the damages described in a of this provisions designed to a manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at their source by regulating activities that cause these problems b utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems c maintain the predevelopment volume of groundwater recharge and prevent degradation of groundwater quality d maintain the predevelopment peak and volume of stormwater runoff and prevent degradation of surface water quality e minimize nonpoint source pollutant loadings to the ground and surface waters f minimize impacts on stream temperatures g maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the municipality and the commonwealth h preserve and restore the floodcarrying capacity of streams i provide proper maintenance of all permanent stormwater management facilities that are constructed in the municipality j provide performance standards and design criteria for watershedwide stormwater management and planning statutory authority the municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the

lieu of meeting the minimum distance criteria the applicant may provide documentation from a registered professional engineer in the commonwealth of pennsylvania that the increased flows from the site leaves the site in the same manner as the predevelopment condition and that there will be no adverse affects to properties along the path of flows or that the increased flows will reach a natural watercourse or an existing stormwater management structure before adver sely affecting any property along the path of the flows b the municipality upon request by the applicant may grant an exemption from the provisions of this a project qualifying under a if an exemption is granted the municipality may require the developer to pay a fee in an amount established by separate resolution of the board of supervisors to the municipal stormwater management capital fund repealer any ordinance or ordinance provision of the municipality inconsistent with any of the provisions of this ordinance is hereby

distribution sealed scs type ii design storm by gert aron penn state university the scs type ii storm distribution  is widely accepted for the construction of a design storm a problem in the practical application of the distribution however i s the steepness of the scs curve shown in figure 1which makes it difficult to read relative rainfall amounts at short time intervals for the purpose of developing a 0 fie l 6 12 18 24 time hours systematic procedure to generate design scs storm distributio storms of any desired time interval equations were fitted to the scs type ii storm distribution a method for constructing a center peak storm is  described below to develop a useful equation the storm distribution was rearranged to an early peaking pattern starting with the steepest portion of the scscurve and progressively decreasing in slope with time the rearranged distribution is also shown in figure 1 and can be expressed by the equations  pt  225 p24 t24046 pt  p24 t24025 for t < 12 hour for t > 12 hour 1   2 where p  total precipitation in duration t t  storm duration in hours design storm construction thedesign storm construction procedure is best described by an example as follows a 25year design storm of 2 hours duration expressed in 15minute intervals is needed from an appropriate source like tp40 or similar maps the corresponding 24hour rainfall amount is 40 inches a table with five columns is required  1 col 1 is time t iri minutes or hours in column 2 the relative rainfall p p24 is shown as computed by eq s 1 or 2 for durations t 2 in column 3 the relativeamounts from column 2 aremultiplied by 40 the 24hr rainfall these values represent the storm amounts from the steepest portions of the scs curve of duration t   3 the rainfall increments between successive durations are computed from column 3 and listed in column 4 these values would constitute the successive rainfall increments and thus the hyetograph for an earlypeking storm  4 to generate a centerpeaking roughly synmetr1calstorm the increments in colurm 4 are rearranged in column 5 placing the largest increment of 110  inches in the 5th time interval the second 1argest in the 4th time interval the thirdlargest in the 6th time interval the fourthlargest in the 3rd time interval and so forth until a rainfall increment is assigned to each time interval tohickon creek

requirements 1 site preparation  areas under the embankment and any structural works shall be cleared grubbed and the topsoil stripped to remove the trees vegetation roots or other objectionable material in order to facilitate cleanout and restoration the pool area will be cleared of all brush and excess trees 2 cut off trench  a cutoff trench will be excavated along the centerline dam on earth fill embankments the minimum depth shall be two feet the cutoff trench shall extend up both abutments to the riser crest elevation the minimum bottom width shall be eight feet but wide enough to permit operation of compaction equipment the side slopes shall be no steeper than  compaction requirements shall be the same as those for the embankment the trench shall be kept free from standing water during the backfilling operations 3 embankment  the fill material shall be taken from selected borrow areas it shall be free of roots woody vegetation oversized stones rocks or other objectionable material areas on which fill is to be placed shall be scarified prior to placement of fill the fill material should contain sufficient moisture so that it can be formed by hand into a ball without crumbling if water can be squeezed out of the ball it is too wet for proper compaction fill material will be placed in 6 to 8 inch layers and shall be continuous over the entire length of the fill fill material must be compacted to a minimum of 95% of modified proctor density as established by astm d1557 compaction testing by a certified soils engineergeologist must be completed as directed by the township engineer to verify adequate compaction has been achieved appendix b riparian forested buffer riparian forested buffer vegetative bmps appendix b j       _  ti zone1

buffers is called the 3zone buffer is illustrated infigure 2 usda napr0790 the wdth of each of the zones may vary depending upon the size of the stream and its topographic setting however 85 feet is sufficient inmost small and mediumsized streams to incorporate the funct ions of the three zones 3zone buffer zone 1starts from the top of stream bank and typically is 15feet wide or wider vegetation in zone 1generally consists of trees and woody shrubs vegetation in the zone provides shade and detrital nutrients for aquatic organisms and stabilizes banks stabilization also may require additional techniques described in the stream bank stabilization bmp minimal disturbance is recommended for this area  however vegetation structure must be maintained zone 2 typically is 60 feet wide the function of zone 2 is to provide necessary contact time and material for buffering and filtering processes zone 2 cannot mitigate concentrated flow therefore for the buffer to be effective only sheet or subsurface flow may reach this area vegetation inzone 2 consists of trees and shrubs suitable nutrient filtering species are listed in appendix h plant lists for wetland management the pennsylvania state universitys the agronomy guide should be consulted before establishing riparian forested buffers  zone 3 typically is 20feet wide the function of zone 3 is to filter sediment take up nutrients and convert concentrated flow to sheet flow specifications for designing buffers inzone 3 are discussed in the filter strip bmp   reference pennsylvania handbook of best management practices for
