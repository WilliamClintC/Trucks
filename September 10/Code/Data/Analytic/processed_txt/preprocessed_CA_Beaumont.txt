governments wrcog a joint powers agency comprised of the county of riverside and 18 cities located in western riverside county acting in concert the wrcog member agencies developed a plan whereby the

recommended tumf participating jurisdictions amend their applicable tumf ordinances to reflect changes in the tumf network and the cost of construction in order to update the tumf program c the city council has been informed and advised and hereby finds that if the capacity of the regional system is not enlarged and unless development contributes to the cost of improving the regional system the result will be substantial traffic congestion in all parts of western riverside county with unacceptable levels of service furthermore the failure to mitigate growing traffic impacts on the regional system will substantially impair the ability of public safety services police and fire to respond and thus adversely affect the public health safety and welfare therefore continuation of a tumf program is essential d the city council finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the use of the tumf and the type of development projects on which the fees are imposed because the fees will be used to construct the transportation improvements that are necessary for the safety health and welfare of the residential and nonresidential users of the development in which the tumf will be levied e the city council finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the need for the improvements to the regional system and the type of development projects on which the tumf is imposed because it will be necessary for the residential and nonresidential users of such projects to have access to the regional system such development will benefit from the regional system improvements and the burden of such developments will be mitigated in part by payment of the tumf f the city council finds and determines that the cost estimates set forth in the new 2016 nexus study are reasonable cost estimates for constructing the regional system improvements and the facilities that compromise the regional system and that the amount of the tumf expected to be generated by new development will not exceed the total fair share cost to such development g the fees collected pursuant to this be used to help pay for the design planning construction of and real acquisition for the regional system improvements and its facilities as identified in the 2016 nexus study the need for the improvements and facilities is related to new development because such development results in additional traffic and creates the demand for the improvements h by notice duly given and published the city council set the time and place for a public

loss of water shall not exceed 005 gallon per day per inch of pipe diameter per foot of length tested including the length of service laterals    exceptions it is recognized that unusual conditions not anticipated in the composing of these criteria may arise of such nature that strict conformance would lead to designs not indicative of the application of proper engineering skill the criteria shall not be interpreted to excuse the designing engineer from the need to develop an allaround good design on the other hand rigid conformance to the criteria may not be required in situations where no useful purpose would be served therefore the city manager may reject a design that he considers unsatisfactory even though it may not specifically violate any criterion listed in this he may grant exceptions to the criteria of this the exercise of sound engineering judgment requires such exceptions  viii  enforcement damages and penalties   disconnection for illegal use if a connection to a sewerage system of the city is used to discharge materials prohibited by this the city manager may order the property disconnected from the sewer or the water supply to the property disconnected or both he may excavate and sever the service lateral to disconnect the property upon the property owner taking steps to prevent a recurrence of the illegal discharge the property may be reconnected before such reconnection is made the owner shall reimburse the city for the expenses of disconnection and any damages for the illegal discharge plus twenty percent for administration    assessment of damages a if the city manager finds that any person has discharged any liquid or solid wastes into the sewerage system of the city in violation of this that the discharge caused harm to the sewerage

investment in their residences and appurtenances for which space is rented or leased alternate sites for relocation of mobile homes are difficult to find due to restrictions of age size or style of

and the risk of damage in moving is significant b a significant percentage nearly 11% of the residential population of the city of beaumont resides in mobile homes c mobile homes are often occupied by senior citizens persons on fixed income and persons of low or moderate income where extreme rent adjustments fall upon these individuals with particular harshness many mobile home owners have a substantial portion of their net asset worth invested in their mobile homes the continuing possibility of unreasonable space rental adjustments in mobile home parks threatens to diminish the value of the investment of the mobile home owners in their homes further existing state law permits mobile home park owners to require mobile home owners to make modifications to their homes for reasons of aesthetics or conformity to park standards that amount to capital improvements which would accrue to the benefit of the park owner by potentially increasing the market value of the park itself d the

owners and mobile home park tenants in favor of the park owners e the city council of the city of beaumont finds and declares it necessary to facilitate and encourage fair bargaining between mobile home owners and park owners in order to achieve mutually satisfactory agreements regarding space rental rates in mobile home parks a to preserve to the residents the value of their mobile homes and b

unreasonable space rental adjustments while simultaneously recognizing and providing for the need of park owners to receive a just and reasonable return on their property f the city council of the city of beaumont finds that it is the goal of the citys housing element to conserve and improve existing affordable housing in the city and to prohibit conversion of mobile home rental units or mobile home parks to ownership or other uses unless conditions are adopted to maintain existing affordable conditions g the city council of the city of beaumont finds and declares that enacted in 198 and

other than a fair return on property in which case the base year net operating income may be adjusted in order to make such a determination the arbitrator or its designee must make at least one of the following findings a the owners operating and maintenance expenses in the base year were unusually high or low in comparison to other years in such instances adjustments may be made in calculating such expenses so the base year operating expenses reflect average expenses for the property over a reasonable period of time the arbitrator shall consider the following factors 1 the owners made substantial capital improvements during the base year which were not reflected in the rent levels on the base date 2 substantial repairs were made due to damage caused by natural disaster vandalism or other cause which management has taken appropriate action to reduce 3 maintenance and repair were below accepted standards so as to cause significant deterioration in the quality of housing services 4 other expenses were unreasonably high or low notwithstanding the following of prudent business practices by management b the rental rates in the base year were disproportionate due to enumerated factors below in such instances adjustments may be made in calculating gross rents consistent with the purpose of this the rental rates in the base year were substantially higher or lower than in preceding months by reason of premiums being charged or rebates being given for reasons unique to particular units or limited to the period determining the base rent 2 the rent in the base year was substantially higher or lower than at other times of the year by reason of seasonal demand or seasonal variations in rent 3 the rental rates in the base year were exceptionally high or low due to other factors which would cause the application of the base year net operating income to result in gross inequity to either the owner or tenant    determination of base year net operating income a to determine the net operating income during the base year there shall be deducted from the annualized gross income being realized in 199 a sum equal to the actual operating expenses for calendar year 199 unless the owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the arbitrator that the use of some other consecutive 12month period is justified by reasons consistent with the purposes of this section b in the event the owner did not own the subject property during the base year the operating expenses for 1991 shall be determined by one of the following methods whichever the arbitrator or board determines to be more reliable in the particular case 1 the previous owners actual operating expenses as defined in such figures were available or 2 actual operating expenses for the first calendar year of new ownership adjusted to 1991 c park owners shall be entitled to maintain and increase their net operating income from year to year in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this shall

mobile home park    determination of current year net operating income to determine the current year net operating income there shall be deducted from the annualized gross income determined by analyzing the monthly rents in effect at the time of filing of a petition a sum equal to the actual operating expenses for the last calendar year unless the owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the arbitrator that the use of some other consecutive 12month period is justified by reasons consistent with the purposes of this section    schedule of increases in operating expenses where scheduling of rental increases or other calculations require projections of income and expenses it shall be assumed that operating expenses exclusive of property taxes and management expenses increase at five percent per year that property taxes increase at two percent per year and that management expenses constitute five percent of gross income provided however that if actual increases are greater or less than those listed in this section the actual increases shown according to proof shall be the increases applicable    discretionary considerations while the net operating income formula should operate to provide a park owner a fair return on the park the hearing officer or arbitrator considering a request for rent increases shall consider all relevant factors presented in making a

unless agreed upon by the residents and the park owner    rent adjustments for reduction in utility services a if a mobile home park provides in the rent without separate charge utilities or similar services including but not limited to natural gas electricity water sewer trash andor cable television and converts to separate charge for such service by separate metering separate charge or other lawful means of transferring to the tenant the obligation for payment for such services the cost savings shall be passed tenants by a rent adjustment equal to the actual cost to the park of such transferred utility or similar service less common area usage based on costs for the 12 months period prior to notice to the tenants of the change it is the intent of this those rental agreements entered into on or after  to be consistent with the provisions of civil 41 as adopted by of the statutes of 1990 b for purposes of this section in determining cost savings to be passed on to tenants in the form of decreased rent the cost of installation of separate utility meters or similar costs incurred by the owner to shift the obligation for payment of utility costs to the tenants shall not be considered however this shall not be construed to prohibit or prevent the consideration of inclusion of such costs as an increased operating expense at arbitration    quantum of proof and burden of

variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of the are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to real property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this create an exceptional hardship to the applicant the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners an objective of the city is to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements of this quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  2 3408   conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a city official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for each $10000 of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county of riverside recorder in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  2 3408   appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the city  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  and 2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a d are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this  2 3408 reasonable accommodations   purpose the purpose of this to establish a formal procedure for individuals with disabilities seeking equal access to housing to request a reasonable accommodation as provided by the federal fair housing amendments act of 1988 and californias fair employment and housing act and to establish criteria to be used when considering such requests

accommodation is pending all laws and regulations otherwise applicable to the property that is the subject of the request shall remain in full force and effect    findings the written decision to grant grant with modifications or deny a request for reasonable accommodation shall be consistent with acts shall if granted be granted to an individual and shall not run with the land unless the director or designee determines that much a modification is physically integrated into the residential structure and cannot easily be removed and shall be based on consideration of the following factors a whether the housing which is the subject of the request for reasonable accommodation will be used by an individual with disabilities under the acts  b whether the requested accommodation is necessary to make housing available to an individual with disabilities protected under the acts  c whether the requested accommodations would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city  d whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the citys land use and zoning program and  e whether there are any alternative reasonable

mortar should be prehydrated to reduce excessive shrinkage the proper prehydration process is as follows all dry ingredients should be thoroughly mixed only enough clean water should be added to the dry mix to produce a damp workable consistency which will retain its shape when formed into a ball the mortar should stand in this dampened condition for one 1 to one and onehalf 112 hours the joints to be tuckpointed should be dampened but to ensure a good bond the brickwork must absorb all surface water add water to the prehydrated mortar to bring it to a workable consistency which is somewhat drier than conventional mortar the mortar should be packed tightly into the joints in thin layers not to exceed onequarter inch 14 each layer should become thumbprint hard before applying the next layer the joints should be tooled to match the original profile after the last layer of mortar is thumbprint hard relaying of brick replacement bricks must match the originals with respect to size
