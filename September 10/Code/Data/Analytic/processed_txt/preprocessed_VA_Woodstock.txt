recognizes that certain waivers and modifications to other sections of the towns zoning ordinance as well as its subdivision ordinance and site development standards may be required for effective tnd implementation the tnd master plan and development code shall demonstrate a strong physical interrelationship among its internal neighborhoods individual buildings civic spaces infrastructure and landscaping that creates a sense of place and community individual buildings should be defined by varying scale and architectural stylings while commercial and residential buildings should also employ complementary massing colors materials and proportions vertically integrated uses eg the placement of residential or other uses above office and retail uses are encouraged in the mixeduse components of a tnd project the tnd district promotes higher densities with buildings fronting public streets the zoning process will establish both minimum and maximum development densities for uses within a proposed project while providing flexibility to the applicant in mixing and matching densities three primary tnd subdistrictsvillage center transitional and residential subdistrictsare structured to differentiate the geographical location of internal land uses mix of uses densities and other design parameters within the tnd project a fourth subdistricteconomic developmentallows for specialized and conditional accommodation of certain largescale retail office parks manufacturing warehousing and other employment uses that are not commonly located within traditional neighborhood developments the zoning amendment application for a tnd district may propose one or more of these subdistricts within the planned development while it may not be required by the town in every instance each application for a tnd district zoning map amendment should incorporate two or more subdistricts however based on the existing land uses infrastructure capacity and marketplace characteristics common to each of the designated urban development areas the town shall have approval of the final number and mix of subdistricts to be included in the tnd zoning map amendment application zoning map amendment applications shall address the purpose and intent of traditional neighborhood development and further the application should demonstrate compatibility with the following tnd principles 1 appropriate location and tnd densities establish viable areas for residential and commercial land uses at a compact scale with densities appropriate for tnd growth that are located either within or close to existing developed areas and community facilities 2 mix of uses establish a blended mix of residential and nonresidential land uses within the uda that reflect tnd planning objectives enhance the quality of life of those who live there and best serve the towns demographic demands 3 variety of housing create a variety of housing types to meet the range of projected family income distributions of both existing residents and future residential growth 4 tnd lot types and geometry encourage better spatial organization reduction of front and side yard building setbacks and smaller lot sizes 5 pedestrian and vehicle compatibility incorporate a network of pedestrianfriendly road and street designs 6 design standards and criteria for tnd streets reduce subdivision street widths and turning radii at street intersections and provide contemporary standards for street landscaping pedestrian improvements and pavement design 7 neighborhood connectivity establish interconnectivity between streets and pedestrian networks within the tnd project 8 local and regional transportation connectivity promote the interconnection of new local streets with existing local streets and regional thoroughfares 9 environmental preservation ensure the preservation of natural areas and open space in conjunction with the tnd master planning process 10 adequate public infrastructure demonstrate a the availability and adequacy of public water and sewer systems and other requisite public infrastructure or b the ability to concurrently provide for these systems and infrastructure 11 phasing of development plan for the phasing of tnd development within the uda that is consistent with anticipated population and employment growth as well as public facilities and infrastructure capacity zoning map amendments for a tnd district shall be initiated by the property owners or its bona fide agent in geographical areas other than the two designated urban development areas the town may require that a tnd zoning map amendment application be either preceded or accompanied by an amendment to the comprehensive plan 1  a tnd subdistricts a village center subdistrict the village center subdistrict is intended to be the primary location and activity center for nonresidential uses within the tnd district the village center shall be sized for a mix of uses that establishes its location as a dominant destination point for civic life within the tnd project however the village center should not be designed and sized to compete with or cannibalize commercial and employment uses in the towns existing downtown core area with a focus on a compact main street form of development the village center may accommodate a range of retail services restaurant office lodging institutional and civic uses that are scaled to the neighborhood demands of the tnd project and nearby properties the village center subdistrict is not intended as appropriate for the location of big box commercial industrial or other largefootprint commercial buildings that may be better suited for the economic development subdistrict more compact residential dwellings multifamily townhouse and livework as well as mixed commercialresidential land uses are recommended for the village center incorporating a mix of lot groups 1 and 3 dwelling types it should be master planned as a pedestrianfriendly mixeduse area with a gridstyled street system that provides vehicular and pedestrian interconnectivity with the adjoining residential and transitional neighborhoods building frontages should define the public streetscape with onstreet parking utilities and landscaping located within the public right of way the amount and location of commercial uses in the village center subdistrict should complement woodstocks existing commercial base thus in planning for tnd projects in the town tnd residential and transitional uses may better serve the woodstocks goals than creating additional commercial centers therefore subject to review and approval of the town council a village center subdistrict may not be required in each tnd district application tnd development proposals for the village center subdistrict shall be reviewed for consistency with the adopted traditional neighborhood development goals for the uda the objectives for downtown woodstock and other relevant policies of the comprehensive plan b transitional subdistrict this subdistrict is intended to accommodate a transitional mix of lower intensity of uses in areas that separate the village center subdistrict from the lower density residential subdistrict a mix of lot groups 1 2 and 3 should be provided light commercial uses and shops are permitted in the subdistrict but should be complementary to those in both the village center and downtown woodstock a variety of residential uses and lot types are permitted in this subdistrict along with community centers churches livework residential restaurants and neighborhoodscaled shops transitional subdistrict uses should be within walkingdistance proximity to the communitys village center as with the village center subdistrict a mix of reduced lots sizes frontages setbacks and building formats should be scaled to complement neighborhood streetscapes public right of way improvements should include sidewalks landscaping streetlights and onstreet parking to preserve the capacity of onstreet parking public street access to front loaded parking pads and garages is discouraged in residential neighborhoods while offstreet parking should be relegated to the rear of individual residential lots singlefamily and attached residential offstreet parking and garages should be accessed by alleys where feasible subject to approval of the town council a transitional subdistrict may not be a required component of every tnd district application development proposals for the transitional subdistrict shall be reviewed for consistency with the adopted traditional neighborhood development goals objectives for downtown woodstock and the overall policies of the comprehensive plan c residential subdistrict this subdistrict is intended to accommodate lower density residential uses than those found in the village center and transitional areas neighborhoods of mixed housing types sizes and lot types are strongly recommended with guidelines for the mix established with each tnd district application a mix of lot groups 1 and 2 should accommodate the majority of the residential dwellings with the option for a smaller percentage of lot group 3 residences to be interspersed at lower densities also the applicant may propose other residential lot types to be included with the code of development to optimally serve the marketplace the residential subdistrict should feature blocks that accommodate a mix of lot sizes frontages setbacks and housing types that are complemented by attractive streetscapes playgrounds greens and parks should be internally located within and central to subdistrict neighborhoods interconnected neighborhood street patterns with pedestrian improvements are a priority and culsdesac should be avoided except in cases where severe terrain limitations restrict their use community streets should be designed to vdot standards and dedicated for public use rear alleys that access offstreet parking for individual lots are encouraged but not required where public street access to private offstreet parking is provided frontage driveways should be shared between adjoining lots and private garages should be located to the rear of the principal structure subject to approval by the town council a residential subdistrict may not be required component of every tnd district application development proposals for the residential subdistrict shall be reviewed for consistency with the adopted traditional neighborhood development goals and policies of the comprehensive plan d economic development subdistrict this subdistrict recognizes that certain uses of a higher density and community impact may be appropriate for inclusion in a tnd district zoning application rather than require the applicant to request a separate zoning district amendment for these uses the economic development subdistrict provides the flexibility for the town to conditionally approve certain largescale commercial and industrial uses of a scale orientation and impact not typically found in either downtown woodstock or new traditional neighborhood developments but which otherwise can be shaped to fulfill the towns economic development objectives big box power center industrial or largefootprint nonretail employment uses that complement the balance and marketplace attractiveness of the tnd district may be approved by special permit however the town at its sole discretion may determine that the economic development subdistrict is not appropriate for inclusion in a given tnd district application development proposals for the economic development subdistrict shall be reviewed for consistency with both the uda traditional neighborhood development goals the objectives for downtown woodstock and the overall economic development policies of the comprehensive plan 1  b subdivision ii  development standards tnd district area requirements a tnd district size there is no minimum or
