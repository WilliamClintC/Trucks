health agencies of the county in order to protect and preserve the health safety and welfare of the patrons of the businesses as well as citizens of the city bthe city council and staff have conducted an extensive review of land use studies concerning the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses in other cities including but not limited to garden grove california 1991  phoenix arizona 1986

city oklahoma 1986  beaumont texas 1982  and whittier california 1978 cfrom review of other cities studies and testimony from its citizens there is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them causing among other adverse secondary effects increased crime and downgrading of property values dit is recognized that sexually oriented businesses due to their nature have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when they are operating in close proximity to each other thereby contributing to crime lower property values urban blight and downgrading of the quality of life in the adjacent area ethe city council finds that sexually oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including prostitution and sexual liaisons of casual nature fincreased crime and unhealthful conduct tend to accompany concentrate around and be aggravated by sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to prostitution pandering exposing minors to harmful materials possession and distribution of obscene materials and child pornography possession and sale of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons and property gconcern over sexually transmitted diseases including aids is a legitimate health concern of the city which demands reasonable regulations of sexually oriented businesses in order to protect the health and wellbeing of the citizens hthe city council has considered in part each of the following matters 1areas within close walking distance of single and multiplefamily dwellings should be free of sexually oriented business uses  2areas where children could be expected to walk patronize or frequent to be free of sexually oriented business uses  3sexually oriented business uses should be located in areas of the city which are not in close proximity to residential uses churches parks or other public facilities and schools  4the image of the city as a pleasant attractive place to reside will be adversely affected by the presence of sexually oriented business uses in close proximity to residential land uses churches parks and other public facilities and schools  5sexually oriented business land use should be regulated by zoning to separate it from other dissimilar uses just as any other land use should be separated from uses with characteristics different from itself  6residents of the city and persons who are nonresidents but use the city for shopping and other commercial needs will move from the community or shop elsewhere if sexually oriented business land uses are allowed to locate in close proximity to residential uses churches parks and other public facilities and schools  7merchants in the commercial area of the city are concerned about the adverse impact and the character and quality of the city in the event that sexually oriented business land uses are located within close proximity to residential uses churches parks and other public facilities and schools and that the locations will reduce retail trade to commercial uses in the vicinity thus reducing property values and tax revenues to the city  and that the adverse effect on property values and business would cause the loss to some commercial districts within the city leading to further deterioration of the commercial quality of the city  and 8no evidence has been presented to show that location of sexually oriented businesses within the city will improve the commercial viability or quality of life of the community izoning licensing and other police power regulations are legitimate reasonable means of accountability to ensure that the operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and are located in places which minimize the adverse secondary effects which naturally accompany the operation jthe city recognizes the possible harmful effects on children and minors exposed to the effects of such businesses and the deterioration of respect for family values and the avoidance of such businesses which necessitate children walking visiting in the immediate neighborhood of the businesses kthe city council finds that there would be a deterioration in the quality of businesses which choose to operate in and around the sexually oriented businesses lthe city council desires to minimize and control these adverse secondary effects and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of the citizens  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods and businesses  deter the spread of urban blight  and protect against the threat to health from the spread of communicable and social diseases mthe city council has considered the decisions of the united states supreme court regarding local

1993 nthe city council has determined that locational criteria alone do not adequately protect health safety and general welfare of the people of the city and thus certain requirements with respect to the ownership and operation of sexually oriented businesses is in the public interest othe city council consistent with sale and consumption of alcohol and outside advertising limitations further finds that restricted hours of operation will further prevent the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented business pit is not the intent of this chapter to suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment but to enact a content neutral ordinance which addresses the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses qit is not the intent of the city council to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material and the council recognizes that state law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages state enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against the illegal activities in the city rthe city council and staff find that the live entertainment presented by some sexually oriented business establishments involves a considerable amount of bodily contact between patrons and performers including physical contact while giving and receiving gratuities hugging kissing and sexual fondling of performers and patrons many sexually oriented businesses offer sofacouch or straddle dancing in these dances the performers sometimes do things such as sit in the patrons lap  place their breasts against the patrons face  while physical contact is maintained gyrate in such a manner as to simulate sexual intercourse  allow patrons to suckle their breasts  breathe heavily into a patrons groin area  and bite and gnaw at as well as fondle the genitals of patrons performers both during the semiprivate dances and on a stage have pulled patrons faces into their vaginal areas including a whipped cream dance wherein patrons were allowed to spoon feed themselves with whipped cream that had been spread on the breasts and vaginal and anal areas of the performer in other instances males have placed a peeled banana between their legs while female performers have eaten the banana some of this conduct would violate the state penal which prohibits among other things the public fondling of genitals although no actual sexual intercourse may be involved contact titillation provided in exchange for a gratuity is tantamount to prostitution sthe city council and staff find that a number of courts have upheld distance limitations between performers and patrons prohibitions against physical contact between performers and patrons and direct payment and receipt of gratuities between performers and patrons at sexually oriented business establishments that provide live entertainment bsa inc v king county 804 f2d 110 111011 9th cir 1986 six feet  kev inc v kitsap county 793 f2d 1091

municipal the violations include distance limitations and direct payment and receipt of gratuities between performers and patrons during physical contact including sexual contact tthe city council and

revd on other grounds 420 us 546 1975 the city council and staff believe that prohibiting physical contact between performers and patrons at a sexually oriented business establishment prohibiting performers from soliciting payment of gratuities from patrons and the direct payment of gratuities to performers by patrons are a reasonable and effective means of addressing these legitimate
