and findings the city council intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol even if done within the confines of a private residence and intends to hold persons responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol the city council finds that 1 events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 years are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring prevention or abatement 2 prohibiting underage consumption protects underage persons as well as the general public from injuries related to alcoholrelated traffic collisions 3 alcohol is an addictive drug which if used irresponsibly could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user 4 often events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents however there are times when the parent is present and condones the activity and in some circumstances provide the alcohol 5 even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a crime it is difficult to prove and an ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage consumption 6 a deterrent effect will be created by holding a person responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or consumption occurs b definitions the following words

oriented businesses footnotes  6  state law reference adult entertainment establishments minn stats   generally a purpose and objectives the city council finds that 1 sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary characteristics particularly when they may be accessible to minors or are located near residential properties or schools day care centers libraries or parks and that such business can exert a dehumanizing influence on persons attending or using such places or facilities 2 sexually oriented businesses can contribute to an increase in criminal activity in the area in which they are located taxing city crime prevention programs and law enforcement services 3 sexually oriented businesses can significantly contribute to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods and can impair the character and quality of the residential housing in the area in which such businesses are located thereby exacerbating the shortage of affordable and habitable housing for city residents 4 the concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area can have a substantially detrimental effect on the area in which such businesses are concentrated and on the overall quality of urban life a cycle of decay can result from the influx and concentration of sexually oriented businesses the presence of such businesses is perceived by others as an indication that the area is deteriorating and the result can be devastating  other businesses move out of the vicinity and residents flee from the area declining real estate values which can result from the concentration of such businesses erode the citys tax base and contribute to overall urban blight 5 the regulation of sexually oriented businesses by prescribing licensing requirements is warranted to prevent criminal activity and promote public health further the prevention of criminal activity and the promotion of public health requires intensive efforts with respect to sexually oriented businesses which exceed those required to control and regulate other business activities in the city b terms the following terms have the meanings provided by pertaining to zoning 1 accessory sexually oriented sales 2 adult body studio 3

invaluable land resource  that lands within the floodplain are or may be subject to loss or imprudent alteration unplanned development  that the proper management of development of such lands is essential to avoid rapid runoff of surface waters to preserve adequate groundwater infiltration to protect surface waters to prevent pollution of the citys water bodies to minimize periodic flooding resulting in loss of life and property to prevent interruption of governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures and to control runoff and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and welfare  and that development within the floodplain must be regulated on the basis of and with proper consideration of the impact on bassett creek and other water bodies in the city 2 it is the purpose of this section to guide and regulate the orderly development of land within the floodplain by establishing a system of management of the floodplain it is further the intent of this section to promote a uniform floodplain management program consistent with the needs of individual cities having lands within the floodplain to maximize the
