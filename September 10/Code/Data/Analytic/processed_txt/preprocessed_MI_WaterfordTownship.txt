measures to discourage and ban the possession and maintenance of animals considered as exotic and not easily domesticated c to describe and classify the breeds of dog generally known as pit bulls or pit bull terriers which are determined to pose an unacceptable risk to the health safety and welfare of the citizens of this community d to provide for restrictions on the care and custody of existing

guidelines and procedures to be utilized by animal control personnel in implementing this article g to provide for penalties and sanctions for violations hereof 00 1221990 legislative classification and findings a with the increasing urbanization and population density of the township the residents of the township must be protected from the attack and threat of injury or disease from certain exotic animals possessed or maintained as domestic animals b this article is enacted following the passage of act 381 of the public acts of 1988 mcl 75049 by the state legislature which provides for substantial penalties to be imposed against persons who promote the possession or use of dogs bred for fighting or baiting c this article is enacted following the passage of act 426 of the public acts of 1988 mcl  et seq by the michigan legislature which provides for additional penalties and procedures for the protection against dangerous animals d the township staff has collected detailed and reliable data from many sources on the number nature and severity of attacks by pit bull terriers upon innocent citizens of this community the metropolitandetroit area and other communities and urban areas within the state and the united states of america e based upon this data the township concludes that pit bull terriers within this community constitute an unacceptable risk of harm and fear to the residents hereof and must therefore be closely regulated as provided herein f the township finds from many reliable sources ample evidence to support the following facts about pit bull terriers 1 pit bull terriers were for centuries developed and selectively bred for the express purpose of attacking other dogs or other animals such as bulls bears or wild hogs 2 in developing a dog for this purpose certain traits were selected and maximized by controlled breeding including extremely powerful jaws a low sensitivity to pain extreme aggressiveness towards other animals and a natural tendency to refuse to terminate an attack once it has begun 3 based on the statistical evidence that pit bull dogs are the leading cause of dog bite related fatalities in the united states and other evidence in the form of individual experiences the pit bull is infinitely more dangerous once it does attack 4 the pit bull terriers massive canine jaws can crush a victim with up to two thousand 2000 pounds of pressure per square inch three 3 times that of a german shepherd or doberman pinscher making the pit bulls jaws the strongest of any animal per pound chapter 3 article ii cont chapter 3 animals 5 the breeds are almost impossible to confine without resorting to fortresslike measures  pit bull terriers can climb over high chain link fences and trees tear metal sheeting with its teeth attack link fencing tear loose its collars and dig under fences and walls requiring the adoption of breedspecific restrictions on the care and custody of licensed pit bull terriers for the protection of the citizens of this community g these findings and facts lead the township to conclude that a prohibition on the possession maintenance and harboring of pit bull terriers as defined herein is reasonable and necessary for the protection of the public health safety and welfare the board is fully aware that the breed of dog called a bull terrier usually considered to be of the same phenotype as the specific breeds banned herein is not included within the prohibition of this article the board finds that this breed is not commonly found or bred at this time in the state nor the united

at all times election signs given the purpose and intent of this division but recognizing the importance of the protections given to political speech under the state and federal constitutions the township desires to provide more lenient requirements for election signs than for other similar types of temporary signs in the township and to regulate such signage only to the extent required to achieve the townships zoning objectives while concurrently affording a reasonable opportunity to communicate election messages therefore the township exempts temporary election signs from the obligation to meet design and structural requirements from application permit and inspection requirements and from other requirements in view of the fact that unlike other signs in the township including other types of temporary signs election signs as defined in this ordinance are not intended to be displayed on a permanent basis are erected in a manner and constructed of materials that are not able or intended to withstand exposure to the elements for an extended period of time and are not anticipated to be constructed placed screened or otherwise established in the same manner as permanent signs consequently the regulations in this intended and imposed to protect safety avoid blight and litter preserve the general welfare of the community and otherwise achieve the purpose and intent of this division in the most narrow and least restrictive way possible and while respecting and preserving the first amendment constitutional rights of individuals to engage in political speech

districts wireless communication facilities 1 purpose and intent it is the general purpose and intent of the township to carry out the will of the united states congress by authorizing communication facilities needed to operate wireless communication systems however it is the further purpose and intent of the township to provide for such authorization in a manner which will retain the integrity of neighborhoods and the character property values and aesthetic quality of the township at large in fashioning and administering the provisions of this attempt has been made to balance these potentially competing interests recognizing the number of providers authorized to establish and operate wireless communication services and coverage it is the further purpose and intent of this a facilitate adequate and efficient provision of sites for wireless communication facilities b establish predetermined districts or zones of the number shape and in the location considered best for the establishment of wireless communication facilities subject to applicable standards and conditions c recognize that operation of a wireless communication system may require the establishment of facilities in locations not within the predetermined districts or zones in such cases it has been determined that it is likely that there will be greater adverse impact upon neighborhoods and areas within the township consequently more stringent standards and conditions should apply to the review approval and use of such facilities d ensure that wireless communication facilities are situated in appropriate locations and relationships to other land uses structures and buildings e limit inappropriate physical and aesthetic overcrowding of land use activities and avoid adverse impact upon existing population transportation systems and other public services and facility needs f promote the public health safety and welfare g provide for adequate information about plans for wireless communication facilities in order to permit the township to effectively plan for the location of such facilities h minimize the adverse impacts of technological obsolescence of such facilities including a requirement to remove unused andor unnecessary facilities in a timely manner i minimize the negative visual impact of wireless communication facilities on neighborhoods community land marks historic sites and buildings natural beauty areas and public rightsofway this contemplates the establishment of as few wireless communication facilities structures as reasonably feasible and the use of structures which are designed for compatibility including the use of existing wireless communication facilities structures and the avoidance of lattice structures that are unnecessary taking into consideration the purposes and intent of this the township board finds that the presence of numerous wireless communication facilities tower structures particularly if located within residential areas would decrease the attractiveness and destroy the character and integrity of the township this in turn would have an adverse impact upon property values therefore it is necessary to minimize the adverse impact from the presence of numerous relatively tall wireless communication facilities tower structures having low architectural and other aesthetic appeal to most persons that the absence of regulation would result in a material impediment to the maintenance and promotion of property values and further recognizing that this economic component is an important part of the public health safety and welfare 2 permitted uses subject to the standards and conditions set forth in subsection 6a of this wireless communication facilities shall be considered permitted uses under the following

community and encourage the use of existing structures consistent with the statement of purpose and intent set forth in subsection 1 of this licensed provider of a wireless communication facility must by law be permitted to locate sufficient facilities in order to achieve the objectives promulgated by the united states congress however particularly in light of the dramatic increase in the number of wireless communication facilities reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of the change of federal law and policy in and relating to the federal telecommunications act of 199 it is the policy of the township that all users should collocate on existing wireless communication facilities and attached wireless communication facilities in the interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this as stated above and as stated in subsection 1 if a provider fails or refuses to permit collocation on a facility owned or otherwise controlled by it where collocation is feasible the result will be

uses which because of their very nature have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or when one 1 or more of them are located in near proximity to a residential zone or other sensitive land uses thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects shall not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood or other sensitive land uses these special regulations are itemized in this controls are for the purpose of preventing a concentration of these uses within any one 1 area or to prevent deterioration or blighting of nearby residential neighborhoods and other sensitive land uses these controls do not legitimize activities which are prohibited in other township ordinances b the provisions of this not intended to offend the guarantees of the first amendment to the united states constitution or to deny adults access to these types of businesses and their products or to deny such businesses access to their intended market neither is it the intent of this legitimize

effects including but not limited to personal and property crimes prostitution potential spread of disease lewdness public indecency illicit drug use and drug trafficking negative impacts on property values urban blight litter and sexual assault and exploitation 2 adult entertainment uses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses and should be separated from other such uses to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of such uses in one area 3 each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the township has a substantial government interest in preventing andor abating this substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects which is the townships rationale for this ordinance exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and nonsexually oriented businesses additionally the townships interest in
