rather it is the intent of this section that the control exercised be the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of this section 3 the planning commission may approve or disapprove an application for a planned unit development in an approval the commission may attach such conditions as it may deem necessary to secure compliance with the purposes set forth in this chapter the denial of an application for a planned unit development by the planning commission may be appealed to the legislative body of the jurisdiction  1303 planning commission action a approval in order that it may approve a planned unit development the planning commission shall have authority to require that the applicant meet the following conditions among others it deems appropriate 1 that the proponents of the planned unit development have demonstrated to the satisfaction of the planning commission that they are financially able to carry out the proposed project 2 that the proponents intend to start construction within one year of either the approval of the project or of any necessary zoning district change and intend to complete said construction or approved stages thereof within four years from the date construction begins if such construction is not commenced and pursued in an orderly manner toward completion the commission and council may initiate action to abolish the zoning or reduce the size of the tract to fit the scope of the actual development it is intended that a pud be designed to carryout the objective of the planning practices established by the commission and council for development of the municipality and to be so developed within a reasonable time it is here by declared that the holding for speculative purposes of undeveloped land zoned as a pud is contrary to the purposes of said planning practices established by the commission and council 3 that the development is planned as one complex or land use rather than as an aggregation of individual and unrelated buildings and uses b limitations on application 1 upon approval of a planned unit development construction shall proceed only in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the planning commission and in conformity with any conditions attached by the jurisdiction as to its approval 2 amendment to approved plans and specifications for a planned unit development shall be obtained only by following the procedures here outlined for first approval 3 the building official shall not issue any permit for any proposed building structure or use within the project unless such building

fringe overlay authority the legislature of the state of nebraska under the provision of 19901 rrs delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare therefore the city council of south sioux city nebraska ordains as follows  1401 finding of fact the flood hazards of south sioux city nebraska are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities  2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages  1402 analysis this section uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a base flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this section is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this section it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated in the official flood plain study and illustrative materials dated 6 th day of january 201 as amended 2 calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and over bank areas to convey the base flood 3 computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height 5 delineation of the floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood  1403   101011 purpose it is the purpose of this section to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in section 130232 of this code by applying the provisions of this section to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities 2 required that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction 3 protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard 4 assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the national flood insurance program when identified by the federal insurance administration as a flood prone community  1404 jurisdiction this section shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city of south sioux city nebraska identified on the

conditions this enforcement officer shall make the necessary interpretation in such cases where the interpretation is contested the board of adjustment will resolve the dispute the base flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land the person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable

extended converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable regulations c it is not intended by this section to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this section imposes greater restrictions the provision of the section shall prevail all other sections inconsistent with this section are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only d in their interpretation and application the provisions of this section shall be held to the minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes e the degree of flood protection required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris this section does not imply that areas outside floodway and floodway fringe district boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages this section shall not create liability on the part of the city of south sioux city nebraska or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder f if any section clause provision or portion of this section is adjudged unconstitutional
