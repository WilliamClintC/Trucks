municipalities planning mpc 53 ps  10101 et seq and the second class township ps  65101 et seq  9102 findings and purposes 172007 findings in wrightstown township excessive quantities of soil are eroding from areas undergoing development for nonagricultural uses such as housing developments industrial sites roads and recreation areas the washing blowing and deposition of eroded soil across and upon roadways decrease visibility and reduce the traction of automobiles this soil erosion necessitates the costly repair of gullies washed out fills roads and embankments and causes the undermining of trees the resulting sediment clogs storm sewers and muddies pollutes and silts streams rivers ponds and lakes the sediment is expensive to remove and limits the use of water for most beneficial purposes  promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds  and destroys fish and other desirable aquatic life the sediment reduces the channel capacity of drainage ditches streams and rivers and thus increases the likelihood of flooding and associated damages all of these effects of soil erosion threaten the public health safety and welfare of the citizens of wrightstown township as well as the general ecology of the township purposes the purposes of this to regulate the modification of the natural terrain the alteration of drainage and to provide for certain erosion and sediment control

development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the township and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality through project design impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality groundwater recharge stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems the most cost effective and environmentally advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is project design minimizing impervious surfaces and sprawl avoiding sensitive areas ie stream buffers floodplains steep slopes and designing to topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the township  township of wrightstown pa

stormwater management  statement of findings 32014 the governing body of the municipality finds that inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development and redevelopment throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and floodreduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment stormwater is an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes  25103 purpose 32014 the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health safety and welfare within wrightstown township by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime and by

navigation canal national heritage corridor and the delaware canal state park  and 2 to preserve woodlands riparian buffers and to conserve other areas of significant environmental sensitivity that should not be intensely developed  and 3 to protect the public health and safety of existing residents against the harm from flooding  and 4 to regulate uses and structures at along or near natural or artificial bodies of water especially to avoid increased erosion  and 5 to regulate uses and structures at places having unique historical architectural patriotic interest or value  and 6 to regulate uses and structures at along or near places of relatively steep slope or grade or other areas of hazardous geological or topographic features especially to avoid increased erosion and sedimentation  and 7 to encourage compatible land uses along the delaware canal  and 8 to encourage landowners where the dimensions of the property and proposed new structures or improvements permit to locate structures or improvements as close to the front yard setback line or if the property fronts on the canal the rear yard setback line in order to maximize the special setback area and minimize encroachments into the canal viewshed all in furtherance of the purposes of this overlay district b relationship to other zoning districts the canal overlay district is an overlay to the existing

adopted  the objectives of this to establish requirements for placing installing and maintaining signs in order to preserve and protect the health safety welfare and general wellbeing of the communitys citizens just as regulations for the placement construction and maintenance of buildings and structures is a valid use of the law so are regulations for the placement installation and maintenance of signs a valid use of the law because signs in the literal sense must be considered structures and in a practical sense are capable of producing many of the same nuisances as buildings produce sign regulations are further justified by the primary purpose of a sign to draw attention to its content however since signs can distract drivers or obstruct views the very nature of a sign can be a potential hazard to the safety of the motoring public therefore it is the intent of this regulate the location of signs in such a way that they can fulfill their purpose without causing unsafe conditions for motorists finally it is the objective of this protect and preserve the visual character of the community by regulating the placement installation and maintenance of signs because signs are intended to command visual contact this gives them an important role in the overall visual character of a community this visual impact is an economic fact that affects the value of property
