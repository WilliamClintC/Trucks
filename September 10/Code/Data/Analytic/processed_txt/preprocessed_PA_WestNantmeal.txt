provisions short title this be known as the west nantmeal township stonnwater management and erosion and sediment control  statement of findings the governing body of the township finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance and development throughout a watershed increases flooding flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stmmwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces infiltration and groundwater recharge increases nonpoint source pollution to waterways and threatens public health and safety b inadequate plam1ing and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance and development throughout a watershed can harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of stream beds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c a comprehensive program of stormwater management including minimization of impacts of new development redevelopment and other earth disturbance activities causing accelerated runoff and erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety and general welfare of the people of the township and all of the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater is an impmiant water resource that provides infiltration and groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by reducing the volume of sto1mwater generated and by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality infiltration stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems cost effective and environmentally sensitive stormwater management can be achieved use of nonstructural site design techniques that minimize impervious surfaces reduce disturbance of land and natural resources avoid sensitive areas ie riparian buffers floodplains steep slopes wetlands etc and consider topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime f public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing st01mwater g nonstormwater discharges to municipal or other storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of the waters of the commonwealth purpose the purpose of this to protect public health safety and general welfare property and water quality by implementing drainage and stormwater management practices criteria and provisions included herein for land development construction and eaiih disturbance activities to achieve the following throughout the township a reduce the frequency and magnitude of flooding and stormwater impacts affecting people property infrastructure and public services b sustain or improve the natural hydrologic characteristics and water quality of groundwater and surface waters c protect natural resources including riparian and aquatic living resources and habitats d maintain the natural hydrologic regime of land development sites and their receiving watersheds e minimize land disturbance and protect and incorporate natural hydrologic features drainage patterns infiltration and flow conditions within land development site designs f reduce and minimize the volume of stormwater generated and manage and release stormwater as close to the source of runoff as possible g provide infiltration and maintain natural groundwater recharge to protect groundwater supplies and stream baseflows prevent degradation of surface water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources h reduce stormwater pollutant loads to protect and improve the chemical physical and biological quality of ground and surface waters i reduce scour erosion and sedimentation of stream channels j reduce flooding impacts and preserve and restore the natural floodcarrying capacity of streams and their floodplains k protect adjacent and downgradient lands from adverse impacts of direct stormwater discharges l minimize impervious surfaces and connected impervious surfaces to promote infiltration and reduce the volume and impacts of stonnwater runoff m provide proper longterm operation and maintenance of all permanent stmmwater management facilities bmps and conveyances that are

has been developed to allow homeowners or applicants for small projects to comply with stormwater management requirements of the stormwater management the municipality including sizing designing locating and installing onlot measures referred to herein as best management practices bmps only projects that meet the size thresholds specified in the mun icipalitys stormwater management use this simplif ied approach and are then not required to submit a formal stormwater management site plan to the municipality however these projects are still required to address certain requirements such as stormwater quality infiltration rate and volume management goals as outlined in this simplified approach handbook pennsylvania act 167 pa stormwater management act was authorized on  32 ps pl 864 and gave pennsylvania municipalities the power to regulate activities that affect flooding streambank erosion stormwater runoff and surface and groundwater quantity and quality the municipalitys stormwater management prepared to comply with the pa act 167 requirements and includes provisions allowing this simplified approach to be used for small projects as specified in their the guidelines presented in this handbook are followed the applicant may not require professional engineering services to comply with these stormwater management goals this handbook is organized into five sections  describes requirements and a simplified approach for designing a suitable bmp and a description of what needs to be included on the simplified stormwater management swm site plan ie sketch plan  presents definitions of key terms  presents options of bmps that can be considered for onlot stormwater management  illustrates an example of how to obtain the size and dimensions of a bmps for a sample project  describes the requirements to be met for a simplified approach operation maintenance and inspection plan and agreement the simplified approach requires  the applicant to submit the following to the municipality for review and approval prior to beginning construction o a simplified stormwater management swm site plan ie sketch plan and accompanying worksheet and o a completed and signed simplified approach operation maintenance and inspection plan and agreement  the first 1inch of rainfall runoff from proposed impervious surfaces as defined by the municipalitys  must be captured and removed from the stormwater runoff leaving the applicants property  the applicant to record the simplified approach operation maintenance and inspection plan and agreement at the countys recorder of deeds after signature by the municipality the purpose of requiring effective stormwater management from small projects is to help reduce stormwater runoff in the community to maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources and public safety what needs to be submitted to the municipality  simplified approach worksheet table 4  simplified swm site plan ie sketch plan containing the features described in step 1  simplifed approach operation maintenance and inspection plan and agreement must be signed notarized and after approval and signature by the municipality recorded at the county recorder of deeds if the applicant is using a contractor to construct the project the worksheet and sketch plan must be shared with the contractor to ensure the bmps are properly installed 1 determination of simplified approach volume requirements all proposed impervious areas as required by the municipalitys  must be included in the determination of the amount of new impervious areas and the size of proposed bmps needed to manage stormwater proposed impervious areas on an individual residential lot generally include but are not limited to roof area pavement sidewalks driveways patios porches permanent pools or parking areas etc see the definitions provided in check with the municipal engineer to confirm what features of the proposed project must be included in the calculation of new impervious areas sidewalks driveways or patios that are constructed with gravel or pervious pavers and will not be disturbed or altered in the future may not need to be included in this calculation check with the municipal engineer in these cases the amount of proposed impervious area may be reduced for proposed driveways patios and sidewalks use of gravel pervious pavement and turf pavers all proposed impervious areas must be constructed so that runoff is conveyed to a bmps  no runoff may be directed to storm sewers inlets or other impervious areas ie street without effective stormwater management from a site in addition the use of low impact development is recommended to further minimize the effect of the new construction on water land and air low impact development is a method of development that incorporates design techniques that include minimizing the amount of land disturbance reducing the amount of impervious cover disconnecting gutters and directing stormwater runoff to vegetated areas to infiltrate and redirecting the flow of stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces to vegetated areas instead of the street or gutter below are the steps that must be undertaken to meet the the size and description of the proposed construction as well as important aspects related to the design of the bmps must be documented in the simplified approach worksheet found in table 4 all individuals planning on using the simplified approach are encouraged to review the planned project with the municipal engineer prior to initiating the simplified approach to confirm the following  that the proposed project is not otherwise exempt from the stormwater management control and engineered stormwater management site plan requirements of the municipalitys stormwater management    that the proposed project size is within the range eligible to use this simplified approach   to determine which components of the proposed project must be included in the calculation of impervious areas  and  whether any local conditions are known to the municipal engineer that would preclude the use of any of the techniques included in this simplified approach step 1  prepare the simplified swm site plan ie sketch plan that includes  name and address of the owner of the property and name and address of individual preparing the plan if different than the property owner along with the date of submission  location of all existing structures including buildings driveways and roads within fifty 50 feet of the project site  location of proposed structures driveways or other paved areas with approximate size in square feet  location and distance of any existing surface water features such as streams lakes ponds wetlands or other natural waterbodies within fifty 50 feet of the project site andor bmps depending upon the municipalitys requirements the following may also be required check with the municipal engineer o the project andor bmps cannot cause earth disturbance within fifty 50 feet from a perennial or intermittent stream wetland or waterbody protecting this area from nondisturbance along the aforementioned features helps protect the applicants land from erosion the flood carrying capacity of streams and the water quality of the waterbody where the applicant cannot meet the 50foot nondisturbance width the applicant should work with the municipal engineer to determine if a reduced width is acceptable however a minimum of at least a 10 foot nondisturbance area width should be maintained o if an existing buffer is legally prescribed ie deed covenant easement etc and it exceeds this requirements the existing buffer must be maintained  location orientation and dimensions of all proposed bmps for all rain gardensbioretention infiltration trenches and dry wells the length width and depth must be included on the plan for rain barrels or cisterns the volume must be included  location of any existing or proposed onlot septic system and potable water wells showing rough proximity to infiltration facilities see description of bmps for the appropriate setbacks for onlot septic systems and potable water wells step 2 determine the impervious area to be managed  determine the total area of all proposed impervious surfaces that will need to drain to one or more bmps  also determine the total area for proposed earth disturbance to complete the project and install the bmps the total earth disturbance to complete a project is often greater than the project area to allow for access from construction vehicles stock piling of materials and excavation the total area of earth disturbance must account for all of the construction activities necessary to construct the project  determine locations where bmps need to be placed so that the appropriate amount of stormwater runoff from the proposed impervious surfaces can be captured and managed step 3  select the bmps to be used and determine appropriate sizing criteria  select the bmps to be used and determine the requirements of each from description of bmps o for instance the back half of a garage may drain to a rain barrel and the front half of the garage and a driveway may drain to a bioretention area each bmp will be sized differently manage stormwater runoff and will need to be designed to be consistent with then obtain the required storage volume and surface area needed for each of the proposed bmps from the appropriate heading below  complete table 4 simplified approach worksheet for rain barrelscisterns step 3a select the proposed impervious area value in column 1 of table 1 that is closest to but not less than the determined value step 3b  determine the volume that needs to be provided in cubic feet and gallons to satisfy the volume requirements using columns 2 and 3 in table 1 for rain gardensbioretention or dry well #1 step 3a  select the proposed impervious area value in column 1 of table 2 that is closest to but not less than the determined value step 3b  determine the volume that needs to be provided in cubic feet to satisfy the volume requirements using column 2 in table 2 step 3c  using the value from column 2 determined above and the depth d of the proposed bmp simply determine the surface area needed from column 3 of table 2 note the arrows under column 3 in table 2 indicate which range of depths is appropriate for each bmp to determine the depth based on the area select an area that corresponds to the required volume and is closest to but not more than the area to be used to determine the area based on the depth select a depth that is closest to but not less than the depth that is to be used for infiltration trench or dry well #2 step 3a  select the proposed impervious area value in column 1 of table 3 that is closest to but not less than the determined value step 3b  determine the volume that needs to be provided in cubic feet to satisfy the volume requirements using column 2 in table 3 step 3c  using the value from column 2 determined above and the depth d of the proposed bmp simply determine the surface area needed from column 3 of table 3 note the arrows under column 3 in table 3 indicate which range of depths is appropriate for each bmp to determine the depth based on the area select an area that corresponds to the required volume and is closest to but not less than the area to be used to determine the area based on the depth select a depth that is closest to but not less than the depth that is to be used step 4  submit the final swm site plan simplified approach worksheet and signed and notarized simplified approach operation

implemented the requirements of each bmp as described below are taken directly from the pa stormwater bmp manual december 2006 refer to the pa bmp manual latest version which can be found on the pa department of environmental protections website rain barrelscisterns rain barrels are large containers that collect drainage from roof leaders and temporarily store water to be released to lawns gardens and other landscaped areas after the rainfall has ended rain barrels are typically between 50 to 200 gallons in size the stored water can also be used as a non potable water supply cisterns are larger than rain barrels having volumes of 200 gallons or more and can be placed either on the surface or underground figures 1 and 2 show examples of rain barrels and cisterns respectively that could be used to manage stormwater from a project rain barrels and cisterns are manufactured in a variety of shapes and sizes all of these facilities must make provisions for the following items  there must be a means to release the water stored in the container between storm events in order for the necessary storage volume to be available for the next storm  stormwater must be kept from entering other potable systems and pipes and storage units must be clearly marked do not drink  an overflow outlet should be placed a few inches below the top of the storage container with an overflow pipe to divert flow away from structures once the storage containers are filled  use screens to filter debris and covers lids placed over the containers to prevent insects and debris from entering the storage chamber  make sure cisterns are watertight and do not leak  rain barrels are typically assumed to be 25% full to calculate volume since they are not always emptied before each storm the tables contained in this handbook were developed to account for the 25% increase in the required storage of a rain barrel or a cistern source picture on left  source picture on right  figure 1 rain barrels

placed within the rock to distribute water evenly along the trench that receives stormwater runoff and has no outlet runoff is stored in the void space between the stones and in the pipe and infiltrates bottom of the trench into the underlying soil matrix figure 3 shows a typical cross section of an infiltration trench configuration infiltration trenches shall incorporate or make provisions for the following elements  these facilities should be located a minimum of ten 10 feet or as otherwise required by the municipality from the building foundation to avoid foundation seepage problems and are not recommended if their installation would create a risk of flooding other structures constructed at or below grade  perforated pipe placed within the rock is to be set level  the width is limited to between 3 to 8 feet and the depth ranges from 2 to 5 feet  trench should be wrapped in nonwoven geotextile top sides and bottom  there should be a positive overflow that allows stormwater that cannot be stored or infiltrated to be discharged into a nearby vegetated area  roof downspouts may be connected to infiltration trenches but should contain a cleanout to collect sediment and debris before entering the infiltration area  infiltration testing is recommended to ensure soil is capable of infiltrating stormwater  it is recommended that there be a 2 foot clearance above the regularly occurring seasonal high water table and have a minimum depth to bedrock of 2 feet  the infiltration trench should be at least 50 feet from individual water supply wells 100 feet from community or municipal water supply wells and 50 feet from any septic system component it should not be located near stormwater hotspots refer to b2 definitions  the infiltration trench should be located so that it presents no threat to subsurface structures such as building foundations and basements  protect infiltration areas from compaction by heavy equipment during and after construction  infiltration trenches should be constructed after all earth disturbance associated with a given project or site is stabilized to avoid clogging  the ratio of the drainage area which stormwater runoff is collected from to the area of the footprint bottom area of the infiltration portion of the facility should be as small as possible with a ratio of less than  preferred source pennsylvania stormwater bmp manual padep 2006 figure 3 crosstypical infiltration trench rain gardenbioretention area a rain garden bioretention area is an excavated depression area on the surface of the land in which native vegetation is planted to filter and use stormwater runoff runoff ponds on top of the surface of the rain garden and then infiltrates into an enhanced soilplanting mix below the surface where plants can use the water to grow bioretention improves water quality with the vegetation planted in the facility filtering the water and the root systems encouraging or promoting infiltration figure 4 shows a crosssection of a typical rain garden key elements of a rain garden include  recommended ponding depths not exceeding 1 foot  native vegetation that can tolerate dry and wet weather  an overflow area where if the bioretention area were to overflow the overflow would flow over pervious surfaces ie grass meadow and would not cause harm to property or   an overflow such as a domed riser to allow excess flow from large storms to travel to other infiltration areas pervious areas or connected storm systems designed to receive the excess runoff  for most areas slopes should be limited to  maximum  however where space is limited  side slopes may be acceptable with approval from the municipal engineer  the soilplanting mix depth should not be less than 15 feet deep and typically consist of a mixture of topsoil sand and compost ie mulch the topsoil sand and compost should be uniformly mixed by volume in a 50% 30% 20% mixture respectively source pennsylvania stormwater bmp manual padep 2006 figure 4 crosstypical rain gardenbioretention area dry wells a dry well also referred to as a seepage pit is a subsurface storage facility that temporarily stores and infiltrates runoff from the roofs of buildings or other impervious surfaces a dry well can be either a structural prefabricated chamber dry well #1 or an excavated pit filled with stone fill dry well #2 dry wells discharge the stored runoff via infiltration into the surrounding or underlying soils figure 5 shows a typical prefabricated dry well and a typical dry well configuration with stone fill the following elements shall be incorporated into all dry well designs  these facilities should be located a minimum of ten 10 feet or as otherwise required by the municipality from the building foundation to avoid foundation seepage problems and are not recommended if their installation would create a risk of flooding other structures constructed at or below grade  dry well should be constructed after all earth disturbance associated with a given project or site is stabilized to avoid clogging  during construction compaction of the subgrade soil in the bottom of the dry well should be avoided and construction should be performed only with light machinery  for dry well #2 designs the depth of dry well should be between 15 feet to 4 feet gravel fill should consist of uniformly graded stone with an average diameter of between one and one half and two 15 20 inches with the gravel fill wrapped in a nonwoven geotextile to separate the stone fill from the surrounding soil  at least 1 foot of soil must be placed over the top of the dry well  dry wells should be inspected at least four 4 times annually as well as after large storm events  dry wells should have overflow pipes to allow high volumes of runoff to overflow the facility and flow into a connected infiltration area pervious area or other connected storm sewer designed to receive the excess runoff  every dry well must have at least one monitoring well to assist in the inspection of the dry well to determine how much water is retained within the well during dry weather periods  infiltration testing is recommended to ensure the underlying soil is capable of infiltrating the needed volume of stormwater monitoring well source for picture on left  source for picture on right  figure 5

garage and driveway addition joe homeowner wants to build a 400 square foot two car garage and a 540 square foot 30 long x 18 wide impervious driveway that is graded so that the stormwater runoff drains to the grassy area along one edge of the driveway an annotated copy of table 1 is provided below as table 5 and an annotated copy of table 3 is provided below as table 6 and outlines the steps of this example and a completed table 4 is provided as table 7 step 1  make a sketch of the site plan as shown in figure 6 step 2  determine the total area of all proposed impervious surfaces to drain to each bmp garage roof front 10 feet  x 20 feet    200 sq feet  garage roof rear 10 feet  x 20 feet    200 sq feet  driveway 30 feet  x 18 feet    540 sq feet   total proposed impervious surface 940 sq feet  total proposed earth disturbance area 2500 sq feet  estimated note if the driveway used pervious pavement ie paving blocks then the total impervious area would only be 400 square feet and no stormwater management practices would need to control runoff from the project step 3  select the bmps to be used and appropriate sizing criteria select a bmp or combination of bmps from to be used to satisfy the volume requirement determine the length width depth and other requirements for the bmps in a bmp needs to be placed to catch runoff from the back of the garage and a bmp needs to be placed to capture runoff from the front of the garage and the driveway figure 6 shows the direction the runoff flows and the locations where the bmps are to be placed joe homeowner would like to use a rain barrel bmp #1 to capture the runoff from the rear of the garage and an infiltration trench bmp #2 to capture runoff from the front of the garage and the driveway bmp #1 rain barrelcistern  steps 3a and 3b step 3a  select the proposed impervious area value for bmp #1 the rain barrel or cistern in column 1 that is closest to but not less than 200 in table 1 the value in column 1 that is closest to but is not less than 200 is 200 step 3b  determine the volume that bmp #1 must be to satisfy the volume requirements using columns 2 and 3 in table 1 the volume in gallons of the rain barrelcistern to be used as bmp #1 assuming the rain barrelcistern is 25% full is determined by finding the value in column 3 for the same row that corresponds to the impervious area value determined in step 1 therefore the volume of bmp #1 the rain barrelcistern must be   166 gallons depending on the size of the rain barrels a combination of rain barrels could be used in succession as shown in figure 1 or a cistern could be used bmp #2 infiltration trench  steps 3a step 3a  select the proposed impervious area value for bmp #2 the infiltration trench using column 1 in table 6 find the row in column 1 that is closest to but not less than 740 200 from the front of the garage + 540 from the driveway therefore the value selected is 750 step 3b  determine the volume that bmp #2 the infiltration trench must be to satisfy the volume requirements using column 2 in table 6 the volume of the infiltration trench to be used as bmp #2 assuming a percent void volume of 40% is determined by finding the value column 2 that is in the same row as 750 square feet from column 1 as described in step 2 therefore the volume of bmp #2 must be 156 cubic feet step 3c  utilizing the value from column 2 determined above and the surface area that the proposed bmp will occupy determine the depth needed using column 3 in table 6 joe homeowner would like to place the infiltration trench along the edge of the driveway so it would have a length of 20 feet the smallest width that can be used as stated in the infiltration trench requirements in is 3 feet therefore the area of the infiltration trench is 20 feet  3 feet   60 square feet to find the minimum depth of the trench move toward the right side of the table from 156 cubic feet in column 2 to column 3 and find the column with a value of as close to but not more than 60 square feet which is 52 square feet then obtain the minimum depth of the facility by reading the depth from the column heading at the top of the table therefore the depth of the trench would need to be 3 feet selected bmps bmp #1 rain barrels that provides for at least 166 gallons and bmp #2 a 20 long x 3 wide x 3 deep infiltration trench table 5 example  calculating

that strives to minimize disturbances to land site hydrology and natural resources and maintain the natural hydrologic regime drainage patterns and flow conditions of a site to the maximum extent practicable this appendix is intended to build on that process by providing additional information for achieving site designs that best maintain preconstruction stormwater runoff conditions protect site amenities and preserve natural resources this appendix describes the following components of the natural hydrology site design process  design principles and techniques   design process   design practices  and  references some common drainage design approaches for land development radically alter natural hydrologic conditions by constructing collection and conveyance systems that are designed to remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a detention basin this approach has often led to the degradation of water quality reduced groundwater recharge and increased volumes of runoff as well as the expenditure of additional resources for detaining and managing increased volumes of concentrated runoff at some downstream location the natural hydrology site design process encourages land development site designs that minimize postdevelopment runoff rates and volumes and that minimize needs for artificial conveyance and storage facilities this process strives to incorporate the desired land development into the natural hydrologic landscape in a manner that maintains and utilizes existing site hydrology features and functions to minimize generation of new stormwater this avoids cumulative environmental impacts often associated with land development and reducing the need for and size of constructed stormwater facilities this approach minimizes the disturbance of land area natural features and site hydrology  preserves significant concentrations of open space woodlands and corridors of environmentally sensitive features  and incorporates landscapebased bmps and low impact development techniques to minimize the utilization of more intrusive structural stormwater facilities with this design process the primary goals of a land development project can be achieved while minimizing the negative environmental impacts and avoiding management costs associated with unnecessary stormwater runoff the fundamental principle of this design process is that site hydrology features are considered up front in the land development design process and are prioritized as integral aspects to be maintained and utilized within the site design rather than being first sacrificed for space needed for traditional site layout or for construction of more intrusive stormwater facilities natural hydrology site design is not a new approach but rather a holistic process that combines certain principles of low impact development conservation design and sustainable design and focuses on reducing unnecessary alterations to the natural patterns and functions of existing onsite hydrologic features these natural hydrologic features tend to perform their hydrologic function ie infiltration evapotranspiration flow attenuation pollutant removal etc very efficiently and sometimes have the hydrologic capacity to perform that function on increased runoff loadings from the built environment however care must be taken to adequately characterize the capacity of their hydrologic function and avoid overwhelming the feature with excessive runoff loadings thus causing unintended impairments that are completely counter productive to the purpose of natural hydrology site design preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful site design considerations natural hydrology site design should serve as the foundation of the overall site design approach and when applied in conjunction with the design professionals overall land development goals and desired outcomes can help shape the overall vision and conceptual layout of the land development project site design practices include preserving natural drainage features minimizing impervious surface area reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces and protecting natural depression storage applying this site design process helps maintain site hydrology and manage stormwater by minimizing the generation of stormwater runoff achieved by designing to the land considering site drainage patterns and infiltration characteristics reducing grading and compaction and considering scale and placement of buildings  managing stormwater as close to the point of generation as possible by disconnecting impervious surfaces and distributing storm flows to landscapedbased bmps  providing open and vegetated channel conveyance as needed to treat water quality reduce velocity and infiltrate  and managing remaining conveyed stormwater in common open space as needed to disperse low velocity storm flows treat water quality infiltrate and release a welldesigned site will contain a mix of all those features design principles and techniques natural hydrology site design involves identifying and prioritizing natural resources and natural and manmade hydrologic features and incorporating such features into the overall site design to take advantage of their efficiencies of hydrologic performance their cost efficiencies of reducing the need for or size of constructed stormwater facilities and their aesthetic amenities the five design principles to be achieved by this approach are as follows  minimize land disturbance  both surface and subsurface  minimize the cumulative area to be covered by impervious and compacted surfaces  designing to the land so that the layout of constructed and landscape features utilizes the natural topography and minimizes grading  design the constructed stormwater management system to take advantage of the natural hydrologic landscape to achieve the required stormwater runoff control standards  refine the site design and layout to optimize the cumulative benefits of the natural hydrologic features the constructed stormwater management system and the land development components to achieve the minimum postconstruction runoff volume peak discharge rates and pollutant loads from the proposed land development site techniques to be applied to achieve the design principles are presented in table b1 design process the first step in applying natural hydrology site design is to identify delineate and assess the functions of all existing natural resources and natural and manmade hydrologic features that are located within the project site  will receive discharge from the project site  or may be impacted by runoff or disturbance from the proposed land development project this includes  streams waterways springs wetlands vernal pools and water bodies   drainage patterns conveyances and discharge points   natural infiltration areas and patterns   areas of natural vegetation that provide significant evapotranspiration pollutant removal bank stabilization flow attenuation or riparian buffer functions   floodplains  and  other features that contribute to the overall hydrologic function and value of the site and its receiving streams once this inventory and assessment are completed these identified resources and features are then prioritized for their ability to provide hydrologic function and performance for managing runoff from the proposed site improvements specifically they should be prioritized as follows  those to be incorporated into the site design in a manner that provides for their protection from any disturbance or impact from the proposed land development   those to be protected from further disturbance or impact and for which the proposed land development will provide improvement to existing conditions   those that can be incorporated into and utilized as components of the overall site design in a manner that protects or improves their existing conditions while utilizing their hydrologic function eg for infiltration evapotranspiration or reducing pollutant loads runoff volume or peak discharge rates etc to reduce the need for or size of constructed bmps  and  those that may be considered for alteration disturbance or removal these prioritizations are then applied as the basis on which to begin the site design layout grading construction and permanent ground cover designs to achieve the five 5 design principles outlined above the following section describes just a few of the many design practices methods and techniques that are available to achieve the landowners desired land development goals and the desired environmental efficiencies intended by natural hydrology site design table b1  site design process principles and techniques design principles design techniques minimize land disturbance  both surface and subsurface  maintain the natural soil structure and vegetative cover that are often critical components of maintaining the hydrologic functions of natural infiltration bioretention flow attenuation evapotranspiration and pollutant removal  protect or improve natural resources to reduce the needs for environmental mitigation future environmental restoration and cumulative flow and water quality impacts of unnecessary disturbances within the watershed system  minimize the disturbance of natural surface and groundwater drainage features and patterns discharge points and flow characteristics natural infiltration and evapotranspiration patterns and characteristics natural stream channel stability and floodplain conveyance etc minimize the cumulative area to be covered by impervious and compacted surfaces  minimize the size of individual impervious surfaces  separate large impervious surfaces into smaller components  disconnect runoff from one impervious surface to another  avoid unnecessary impervious surfaces  utilize porous materials where suited in lieu of impervious materials designing to the land so that the layout of constructed and landscape features utilizes the natural topography and minimizes grading  prioritize onsite hydrologic features ie for protection improvement utilization or alteration and natural site drainage patterns and infiltration characteristics and consider them for the cornerstones of the conceptual site design  reduce grading and compaction by applying selective grading design methods to provide final grading patterns tthat preserve existing topography where it most benefits natural hydrologic functions and where needed  this results in graded areas that evenly distribute runoff and minimize concentrated runoff flows  consider the scale and placement of buildings and other infrastructure to minimize impact to natural hydrologic features  incorporate unique natural scenic and historic site features into the configuration of the development and ensure flexibility in development design to meet community needs for complimentary and aesthetically pleasing development such as can be achieved design and sustainable design approaches design principles design techniques design the constructed stormwater management system to take advantage of the natural hydrologic landscape to achieve the required stormwater runoff control standards  incorporate natural hydrologic features that have been selected for their available capacity and function into the overall system of site runoff controls  incorporate low impact development or similar bmps and distribute storm flows to o reduce runoff  o manage stormwater at or as close to the point of generation as possible  o disconnect discharges from streets and municipal storm sewer systems  and o select and design bmps to give first priority to nonstructural and vegetation landscapebased bmps second priority to surface structural bmps third priority to subsurface structural bmps and design subsurface bmps as shallow as possible  provide open channel conveyance as needed to o treat water quality  o reduce runoff velocity  and o promote infiltratation and evapotranspiration of runoff  manage remaining conveyed stormwater from small storms in common open space areas to achieve multiple objectives o disperse storm flows and reduce velocity  o treat water quality  and o promote infiltrate and evapotranspiration of runoff  provide for appropriate conveyance to retention or detention storage facilities as needed for flows from large storm events  maintain open space functions consistent with common area uses passive recreation onsite sewage management scenic vistas etc refine the site design and layout to optimize the cumulative benefits of the natural hydrologic features the constructed stormwater management system and the land development components to achieve the minimum postconstruction runoff volume peak discharge rates and pollutant loads from the proposed land development site apply site design techniques and practices as appropriate based on  conservation design principles and practices  sustainable design principles and practices  low impact development design principles and practices design practices numerous practices and strategies can be considered where their aim is to sustain and utilize the benefits of existing site hydrology and minimize the generation of new stormwater runoff following are brief descriptions of various practices that can be used to achieve the principles of the natural hydrology site design process site layout practices the following site layout practices are but a few of the methods by which the natural hydrology site design process described above can be implemented such practices are less functions of regimented codes and procedures than about understanding and recognizing the benefits and values that existing resources can contribute to the desired outcomes of the land development project in some circumstances communication among design engineers land planning and environmental professionals knowledgeable developers community representatives and regulatory authorities is also beneficial to combine their collective understanding and perspectives to create effective planning efforts preserving natural drainage features protecting natural drainage features particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels is desirable because of their ability to infiltrate and attenuate flows and to filter pollutants unfortunately some common land development practices encourage just the opposite pattern  streets and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in the natural headwater valleys and swales thereby replacing natural drainage functions with an impervious system as a result runoff and pollutants generated from impervious surfaces flow directly into storm sewers with no opportunity for attenuation infiltration or filtration designing developments to fit site topography retains much of the natural drainage function in addition designing with the land minimizes the amount of site grading reduces the amount of compaction that can alter site infiltration characteristics and can result in cost savings to the developer protecting natural depression storage areas depressional storage areas have no surface outlet or drain very slowly following a storm event they can be commonly seen as ponded areas in fields during the wet season or after large runoff events some development practices eliminate these depressions by filling or draining thereby eliminating their ability to reduce surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants the volume and releaserate characteristics of depressions should be protected in the design of the development site to assist in reducing runoff volumes and reducing runoff rates designing around the depression or incorporating its storage as additional capacity in required detention facilities treats this area as a site amenity rather than a detriment avoiding introduction of impervious areas careful site planning should consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible building footprints sidewalks driveways and other features producing impervious surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff in many instances municipalities have the ability to reduce impervious cover by providing incentives or opportunities in their zoning and subdivision land development ordinances to reduce road width reduce or modify culdesac dimensions reduce or modify curbing requirements and reduce or modify sidewalk requirements disconnecting impervious surfaces impervious surfaces are significantly less of a problem if they are not directly connected to an impervious conveyance system such as storm sewer two basic ways to reduce hydraulic connectivity are routing roof runoff over lawns and reducing the use of storm sewers site grading should promote increasing travel time of stormwater runoff from these sources and should help reduce concentration of runoff to a single point within the project site routing roof runoff over lawns roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns in most site designs the practice discourages direct connections of downspouts to drivewaytostreetto storm sewers or parking lots the practice also discourages sloping driveways and parking lots to the street crowning the driveway to run off to the lawn uses the lawn as a filter strip reducing street widths street widths can be reduced by either eliminating onstreet parking andor by reducing roadway widths designers should select the narrowest practical street width for the design conditions speed curvature etc narrower neighborhood streets should be considered and encouraged under select conditions reduced street widths also can lower maintenance needs and costs limiting sidewalks to one side of the street a sidewalk on one side of the street may suffice in lowtraffic neighborhoods the lost sidewalk could be replaced with bicyclerecreational trails that follow backoflot lines as an alternative to reduced sidewalks where appropriate reducing building setbacks reducing building setbacks from streets reduces the size of impervious areas of driveways and entry walks and is most readily accomplished along low traffic streets where traffic noise is not a problem constructing compact developments or conservation design low impact cluster or compact development can reduce the amount of impervious area for a given number of lots savings result from reduced street length which also contributes to a reduction in development and long term maintenance costs reduced site disturbance and preservation of open space help buffer sensitive natural areas and retain more of a sites natural hydrology development can be designed so that areas of high infiltration soils are reserved as stormwater infiltration areas construction activity can be focused onto les sensitive areas without affecting the gross density of development stormwater best management practices stormwater best management practices bmps are intended to supplement natural hydrology site design techniques where needed structural in nature such practices include bioretention facilities rain gardens swales and other engineered stormwater bmps listed here are techniques intended to help manage stormwater predominantly at or near the source rather than traditional techniques that largely release runoff over an extended period of time to adjacent properties and streams this list in no way exhaustive gives examples of a few of the most common practices bioretention this type of bmp combines open space with stormwater treatment soil and plants rather than sand filters treat and store runoff infiltration and evapotranspiration are achieved often coupled with an underdrain to collect water not infiltrated or used in the root zone rain gardens typically rain gardens are shallow depression areas containing a mix of water tolerant native plant species the intent is to capture runoff for storage and use in the root zone of plants intended largely as a way of managing stormwater et rain gardens often function as infiltration facilities as well reducing the need for storm sewers increasing the use of natural or vegetated drainage swales can reduce the need for extending storm sewers for draining streets parking lots and back yards the potential for accelerating runoff from the development can be greatly reduced the practice requires greater use of swales and may not be practical for some development sites especially if there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a reasonable time the practice requires educating local citizens who may expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event using permeable paving materials these materials include permeable interlocking concrete paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete among others such materials should be considered as alternatives to conventional pavement surfaces especially for low use surfaces such as driveways overflow parking lots and emergency access roads surfaces for which seal coats may be applied should refrain from using permeable paving materials sources conservation design for stormwater management delaware department of natural resources and environmental control and the brandywine conservancy september 1997 conservation

for the channel some of the most important factors are the type and size of materials that compose the bed and banks of a channel and the shape of the channel cowan 1956 developed a procedure for estimating the effects of these factors to determine the value of mannings n of a channel in cowans procedure the value of n is computed by the following equation 316 ordinance appendix d west nile virus design guidance west nile virus guidance this source is from the monroe county pa conservation district that researched the potential of west nile virus problems from bmps due to a number of calls they were receiving monroe county conservation district guidance stormwater management and west nile virus source brodhead mcmichaels creeks watershed act 167 stormwater management draft  the monroe county conservation district recognizes the need to address the problem of nonpoint source pollution impacts caused by runoff from impervious surfaces the new stormwater policy being integrated into act 167 stormwater management regulations by the pa department of environmental protection padep will make nonpoint pollution controls an important component of all future plans and updates to existing plans in addition to meet post construction antidegradation standards under the state national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permitting program applicants will be required to employ best management practices bmps to address nonpoint pollution concerns studies conducted throughout the united states have shown that wet basins and in particular constructed wetlands are effective in traditional stormwater management areas such as channel stability and flood control and are one of the most effective ways to remove stormwater pollutants united states environmental protection agency 199 center for watershed protection 2000 from maryland to oregon studies have shown that as urbanization and impervious surfaces increase in a watershed the streams in those watersheds become degraded cwp 2000 although there is debate over the threshold of impervious cover when degradation becomes apparent some studies show as little as 6% while others show closer to 20% there is agreement that impervious surfaces cause nonpoint pollution in urban and urbanizing watersheds and that degradation is ensured if stormwater bmps are not implemented although constructed wetlands and ponds are desirable from a water quality perspective there may be concerns about the possibility of these stormwater management structures becoming breeding grounds for mosquitoes the conservation district feels that although it may be a valid concern municipalities should not adopt ordinance provisions prohibiting wet basins for stormwater management mosquitoes the questions surrounding mosquito production in wetlands and ponds have intensified in recent years by the outbreak of the mosquitoborne west nile virus as is the case with all vectorborne maladies the life cycle of west nile virus is complicated traveling from mosquito to bird back to mosquito and then to other animals including humans culex pipiens was identified as the vector species in the first documented cases from new york in 1999 this species is still considered the primary transmitter of the disease across its range today there are some 60 species of mosquitoes that inhabit pennsylvania along with c pipiens three other species have been identified as vectors of west nile virus while four more have been identified as potential vectors the four known vectors in ne pennsylvania are culex pipiens c restuans c salinarius and ochlerotatus japonicus all four of these species prefer and almost exclusively use artificial containers old tires rain gutters birdbaths etc as larval habitats in the case of c pipiens the most notorious of the vector mosquitoes the dirtier the water the better they like it the important factor is that these species do not thrive in functioning wetlands where competition for resources and predation by larger aquatic and terrestrial organisms is high the remaining four species aedes vexans ochlerotatus canadensis o triseriatus and o trivittatus are currently considered potential vectors due to laboratory tests except the o trivittatus which did have one confirmed vector pool for west nile virus in pa during 2002 all four of these species prefer vernal habitats and ponded woodland areas following heavy summer rains these species may be the greatest threat of disease transmission around stormwater basins that pond water for more than four days this can be mitigated however by establishing ecologically functioning wetlands stormwater facilities if a stormwater wetland or pond is constructed properly and a diverse ecological community develops mosquitoes should not become a problem wet basins and wetlands constructed as stormwater management facilities should be designed to attract a diverse wildlife community if a wetland is planned proper hydrologic soil conditions and the establishment of hydrophytic vegetation will promote the population of the wetland by amphibians and other mosquito predators in natural wetlands predatory insects and amphibians are effective at keeping mosquito populations in check during the larval stage of development while birds and bats prey on adult mosquitoes the design of a stormwater wetland must include the selection of hydrophytic plant species for their pollutant uptake capabilities and for not contributing to the potential for vector mosquito breeding in particular species of emergent vegetation with little submerged growth are preferable by limiting the vegetation growing below the water surface larvae lose protective cover and there is less chance of anaerobic conditions occurring in the water stormwater ponds can be designed for multiple purposes when incorporated into an open space design a pond can serve as a stormwater management facility and a community amenity aeration fountains and stocked fish should be added to keep larval mosquito populations in check publications from the pa department of health and the penn state cooperative extension concerning west nile virus identify aggressive public education about the risks posed by standing water in artificial containers tires trash cans rain gutters bird baths as the most effective method to control vector mosquitoes conclusion the conservation district understands the pressure faced by municipalities when dealing with multifaceted issues such as stormwater management and encourages the incorporation of water quality management techniques into stormwater designs as monroe county continues to grow conservation design infiltration and constructed wetlands and ponds should be among the preferred design options to reduce the impacts of increases in impervious surfaces when designed and constructed appropriately the runoff mitigation benefits to the community from these design options will far outweigh their potential to become breeding grounds for mosquitoes ordinance appendix e stormwater best management practices and conveyances operation and maintenance agreement sample agreement
