following three findings which shall be recorded in the permanent record of the case and shall include the factual reasons on which they are based a there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the chapter in order to determine that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships the board must find that the five following conditions exist 1 if he complies with the provisions of the chapter the applicant can secure no reasonable return from nor make reasonable use of his property merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify the board in granting a variance moreover the board shall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of the chapter that will make possible the reasonable use of his property 2 the hardship results from the application of the chapter to the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship 3 the hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicants property such as its size shape or topography which is different from that of neighboring property 4 the hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly violates the chapter or who purchases the property after the effective date of the chapter and then comes to the board for relief 5 the hardship is peculiar to the applicants property rather than the result of conditions that are widespread if other properties are equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction then granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to others and would not promote equal justice b the variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the chapter and preserves its spirit c in the granting of the variance the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice has been done the board shall not grant a variance if it finds that doing so would in any respect impair the public health safety or general welfare 3 in granting the variance the board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location character and other features of the proposed building structure or use as it may deem advisable in furtherance of the purpose of this chapter if a variance for the construction alteration or use of property is granted such construction alteration or use shall be in accordance with the approved site plan administration enforcement and appeals 25 4 the board of adjustment shall refuse to hear an appeal or an application for a variance previously denied if it finds that there have been no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or application 5 a variance issued in accordance with this section shall be considered a watershed protection permit and shall expire if a building permit or watershed occupancy permit for such use is not obtained by the applicant within six months from the date of the decision 6 if the application calls for the granting of a major variance and if the board of adjustment decides in favor of granting the variance the board shall prepare a preliminary record of the hearing with all deliberate speed the preliminary record of the hearing shall include a the variance application  b the hearing notices  c the evidence presented  d motions offers of proof objections to evidence and rulings on them  e proposed findings and exceptions  f the proposed decision including all conditions proposed to be added to the permit 7 the preliminary record shall be sent to the environmental management commission for its review as follows a if the commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a major variance and that the property owner can secure no reasonable return from nor make any practical use of the property unless the proposed variance is granted and the variance if granted will not result in a serious threat to the water supply then the commission shall approve the variance as proposed or approve the proposed variance with conditions and stipulations the commission shall prepare a commission decision and send it to the board of adjustment if the commission approves the variance as proposed the board shall prepare a final decision granting the proposed variance if the commission approves the variance with conditions and stipulations the board shall prepare a final decision including such conditions and stipulations granting the proposed variance b if the commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a major variance and that the property owner can secure a reasonable return from or make a practical use of the property without the variance or the variance if granted will result in a serious threat to the water supply then the commission shall deny approval of the variance as proposed the commission shall
