general criteria are minimumrequirements for controlling erosion and sedimentation from landdisturbingactivities and should be satisfied in each approved erosionsediment controlplan no permit issued using the general criteria is intended to restrict the useof other innovative practices or modifications to the specified practices if suchpractices are thoroughly described and detailed and approved given as part ofa supplement to the approved plan prior to installation 1 establishment of permanent vegetation a permanent vegetativecover shall be established on disturbed areas not otherwise permanentlystabilized permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until aground cover is achieved which in the opinion of the city administrator or hisdesignee is mature enough to control soil erosion satisfactorily and to surviveseasonal weather conditions if it is determined by the city administrator thatthe vegetation will not withstand seasonal weather conditions the release ofunobligated monies or bonds shall be determined by the board of adjustmentsand appeals 2 protection of adjacent properties properties adjacent to the site ofland disturbance shall be protected from sediment deposition this may beaccomplished by preserving a well vegetated buffer stip around the lowerperimeter of the land disturbance by installing perimeter controls such assediment barriers filters or dikes or sediment basins or by a combination ofsuch measures vegetated buffer strips may not be used alone 3 cut and fill slopes cut and fill slopes must be designed andconstructed in a manner which will minimize erosion consideration must be given to the length and steepness of the slope the soil type upslope drainage area groundwater conditions and other applicable factors slopes which arefound to be eroding excessively within one 1 year of the construction must beprovided with additional slope stabilizing measures until the problem iscorrected the following guidelines are provided to aid site planners and planreviewers in developing an adequate design a topsoil for the area should be stockpiled and then used forreplacement on the graded area b roughened soil surfaces are generally preferred to smoothsurface on slopes c diversions should be constructed at the top of long steepslopes which have significant drainage areas above the slope diversionsor terraces may also be used to reduce slope length d concentrated stormwater should not be allowed to flow down or out of fill slopes unless contained within an adequate temporaryor permanent channel flume or slope drain structure e wherever a slope face crosses a water seepage plane which endangers the stability of the slope adequate drainage or otherprotection should be provided 4 protection of storm sewer inlets all storm sewer inlets which are made operable during construction shall be protected so that sedimentladenwater is necessary precautions must be taken to stabilize the work area duringconstruction to minimize erosion 5 work in stream channel the channel including bed and banksmust always be restabilized immediately after inchannel work is completed where a live wet water course must be crossed by construction vehiclesregularly during construction a temporary stream crossing must be providedthe design of which must be approved by the city administrator or his designee 6 underground utility construction the construction of undergroundutility lines shall be subject to the following criteria a no more than five hundred feet 500 of open trench will beallowed at one time b where consistent with safety and space considerationsexcavated materials are to be placed on the uphill side of trenches c trench dewatering devices shall discharge in a mannerwhich will not adversely affect flowing streams drainage systems oroffsite property 7 construction access routes offsite vehicle tracking of sedimentsand the generation of dust shall be minimized a stabilized construction accessa point of entranceexit to a construction site shall be described andimplemented as needed to reduce the tracking of mud and dirt onto publicroads by construction vehicles the design of the construction access should ata minimum be consistent with the requirements and recommendationscontained in the current edition of the tennessee erosion and sediment control handbook where sediment is transported onto a public road surface the roadsshall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day or more often if deemednecessary sediment shall be removed from roads by shoveling or sweeping andbe transported to a sedimentcontrolled disposal area street washing shall beallowed only after sediment is removed in this manner 8 disposition of temporary measures all temporary erosion andsedimentcontrol measures shall be disposed of within thirty 30 days after finalsite stabilization is achieved or after the temporary measures are no longerneeded unless otherwise authorized by the city manager or his designeetrapped sediment and other disturbed soil areas resulting from the dispositionof temporary measures shall be permanently stabilized to prevent furthererosion and sediment 9 maintenance all temporary and permanent erosion and sedimentcontrol practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed by property ownersto assure continued performance of their intended function as determined bythe city administrator or his designee 10 the constructionphase erosion prevention controls shall be designed to eliminate or minimize if complete elimination is not possible thedislodging and suspension of soil in water sediment controls shall be designedto retain mobilized sediment on site to the maximum extent practicable 11 the design inspection and maintenance of best managementpractices bmps as described in the stormwater pollution prevention planswppp must be prepared in accordance with good engineering practices andat a minimum shall be consistent with the requirements and recommendationscontained in the current edition of the tennessee erosion and sediment control handbook in addition all control measures must be properly selected installedand maintained in accordance with the manufacturers specifications whereapplicable all control measures selected must be able to slow runoff so that rilland gully formation is prevented 12 offsite sediment if sediment escapes the permitted area offsiteaccumulations of sediment that have not reached a stream must be removed at a frequency sufficient to maximize offsite impacts eg fugitive sediment thathas escaped the construction site and has collected in a street must be removedso that it is not subsequently washed into storm sewers and streams by the nextrain andor so that it does not pose a safety hazard to users of public streets aland disturbance permit does not authorize access to private propertyarrangements concerning removal of sediment on adjoining property must besettled by the permittee with the adjoining landowner 13 sediment removal sediment should be removed from sediment traps silt fences sedimentation ponds and other sediment controls asrecommended in the tennessee erosion and sediment control handbook and must be removed when design capacity has been reduced by fifty percent 50% 14 removal of vegetation preconstruction vegetative ground covershall not be destroyed removed or disturbed more than fifteen 15 days prior to grading or earth moving unless the area is seeded andor mulched ortemporary cover is installed clearing and grubbing must be held to the minimum necessary forgrading and equipment operation existing vegetation at the site should bepreserved to the maximum extent practicable 15 construction phasing construction phasing is required on allprojects regardless of size as a major practice for minimizing erosion andlimiting sedimentation construction must be phased to keep the total disturbedarea less than fifty 50 acres at any one time areas of the completed phasemust be stabilized within fifteen 15 days no more than fifty 50 acres ofactive soil disturbance is allowed at any time during the construction projectthis includes offsite borrow or disposal areas the fifty 50 acre limitation does not apply to linear construction projectssuch as roadway pipeline and other infrastructure construction activities ifthe
