maine millinocket sits proudly reflecting on its past while constantly planning for the future the town of millinocket has over the years passed process of legislative change common to many american communities while only a few simple laws were necessary at the time of the establishment of the town subsequent growth of the community together with the complexity of modern life has created the need for new and more detailed legislation for the proper function and government of the town the recording of local law is an aspect of municipal history and as the community develops and changes review and revision of old laws and consideration of new laws in the light of current trends must keep pace the orderly collection of these records is an important step in this evercontinuing process legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records it must be available and logically arranged for convenient use and must be kept uptodate it was with thoughts such as these in mind that the town council ordered the following codification of the towns legislation contents of various chapters of the all currently effective legislation ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted by the town council of the town of millinocket including revisions or amendments to existing legislation deemed necessary by the town council in the course of the codification division of divided into parts administrative legislation contains all town legislation of an administrative nature l millinocket code namely that dealing with the administration of government that establishing or regulating municipal departments and that affecting officers and employees of the municipal government and its departments general legislation contains all other town legislation of a regulatory nature items of legislation in this part generally impose penalties for violation of their provisions whereas those in do not grouping of legislation and arrangement of chapters the various items of legislation are organized into chapters their order being an alphabetical progression from one subject to another wherever there are two or more items of legislation dealing with the same subject they are combined into a single chapter thus for example all legislation pertaining to the regulation of streets and sidewalks may be found in in the chapter entitled streets and sidewalks in such chapters use of has preserved the identity of the individual items of legislation table of contents the table of contents details the alphabetical arrangement of material by chapter as a means of identifying specific areas of legislation wherever two or more items of legislation have been combined by the editor into a single chapter titles of the several articles or parts are listed beneath the chapter title in order to facilitate location of the individual item of legislation reserved chapters unassigned chapter numbers do not appear in the table of contents but are available for assignment to new enactments in this manner new subject matter can be included alphabetically ll 05 01 2011  preface pagination a unique pagenumbering system has been used in which each chapter forms an autonomous unit the first page of each chapter is the number of that chapter followed by a colon and the numeral l thus would begin on page  by the use of this system it is possible to add or to change pages in any chapter or add new chapters without affecting the sequence of subsequent pages numbering of chapterrelated sectionnumbering system is employed in which each section of every item of legislation is assigned a number which indicates both the number of the chapter in which the legislation is located and the location of the section within that chapter thus the first section of would be 61 while the fourth section of would be 534 new sections can then be added between existing sections using a decimal system thus for example if two sections were to be added between 534 and 535 they would be numbered as 5341 and 5342 scheme the scheme is the list of section titles which precedes the text of each chapter these titles are carefully written so that taken together they may be considered as a summary of the content of the chapter taken separately each describes the content of a particular section for ease and precision of reference the scheme titles are repeated as section headings in the text histories at the end of the scheme in each chapter is located the legislative history for that chapter this history indicates the specific legislative source from which the chapter was derived including the enactment number eg ordinance number local law number bylaw number resolution number etc if pertinent and ill 0501  2011 millinocket
