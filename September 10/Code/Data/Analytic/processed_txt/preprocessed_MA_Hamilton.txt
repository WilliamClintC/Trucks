development to the maximum extent feasible the proposed development area shall consist of land outside the identified conservation areas 3 location of dwelling units the third step in the design process is to identify and delineate the approximate location of dwelling units in the proposed development area the number of dwelling units should conform to the allowed osfpd density calculated pursuant to  the location of dwelling units should account for proximity to common open space and other amenities including community buildings for use by residents of the development toward this end the number of dwelling units with direct access to the amenities of the development should be maximized 4 roads and trails the fourth step in the design process is to identify and delineate the approximate location of roads and trails roads shall be aligned to access the dwelling units the layout of new trails should anticipate internal and external connections to existing andor potential future roads trails and sidewalks 5 lotting if applicable the final step in the design process is to identify the approximate location of lot lines 49  common open space requirement to qualify for an
