the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss 2 1991   purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize

stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future floodblight areas  g to ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions 3 1991   methods and provisions in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for a restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the

a piece of property and are not personal in nature though these standards vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in general a properly issued variance is granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners b it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate 1 1991   variancesappeals a the city council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter b the city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter c in passing upon such applications the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and 1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges d any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain board in the office of the los angeles county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land e the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency 2 1991   variancesconditions a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary as defined in this chapter considering the flood hazard to afford relief e variances shall only be issued upon 1 a showing of good and sufficient cause  2 a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in this chapter to the applicant  and 3 a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances as defined in this chapter cause fraud or victimization as defined in this chapter of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety g upon consideration of the factors of subsection c of the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter 3 1991   disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes this chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages this chapter shall not create liability on the part of city council any officer or employee thereof or the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder 6 1991   conflicting provisions this chapter is not intended to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this chapter and another

17 was previously amended in its entirety by users guide a introduction this users guide provides a basic orientation in the organization and use of the calabasas land use and development code development code contained within title 17 of the calabasas municipal users guide is a reference document and as such it is designed to assist in the location of the citys zoning and subdivision regulations the users guide is not a part of the development code and it does not supersede or replace it in the event of conflict between the users guide and the development code the development code shall govern if after consulting this users guide you cannot locate the information you desire regarding the development code or the citys land use and development requirements you should contact the citys community development department b organization of the development development code contains the citys zoning subdivision and other land use regulations additional building construction requirements and other aspects of development and land use can be found in other titles of the calabasas municipal development code regulations which cover related topics have been grouped together into articles there are seven articles and each is summarized below 1 purpose and effect of development i contains basic information on the legal framework of the development code describes the land uses and developmentrelated activities that are regulated by the development code and provides information on how to use the code 2 zoning districts and allowable land uses contains chapters on the different types of zoning districts residential commercial etc that are applicable to public and private property within the city these chapters list the specific types of land uses allowed in each zoning district eg day care facilities home occupations multifamily housing service stations etc and the type of land usedevelopment permit that must be obtained prior to initiating each use this article also contains basic development standards for each zoning district eg maximum height limits and setbackyard requirements for new structures and regulations for each land use 3 site planning and project design standards provides development standards that apply across zoning districts including requirements for landscaping offstreet parking and loading and signage these chapters also contain regulations for specific land uses and development types that may be allowed in a variety of zoning districts eg day care facilities home occupations multifamily housing service stations etc within the zoning district chapters of there are references to the requirements in s regulations generally supplement those in  subdivisions comprises the citys subdivision ordinance this article provides both site planningdesign regulations for new subdivisions and the procedural requirements for subdivision approval consistent with the mandates of the california subdivision map act 5 land use and development permits describes each type of land use and development permit required by this development code and the citys requirements for the preparation filing processing and approval of each permit application this article also sets time limits for exercising a permit and time extension procedures some land usedevelopment approvals may be granted by the director eg zoning clearance administrative plan review sign permit etc while others require review and approval by the commission andor council eg conditional use permit development plan oak tree permit etc 6 development provides information on the development codes administrative framework and procedures including administration amendments enforcement public hearings and appeals this article also contains provisions governing nonconforming structures uses and lots 7 development contains definitions of the specialized and technical terms and phrases used in the development code c format of the development outline the format of the development code follows the layout of the calabasas municipal chapter and section numbers use an expandable decimal numbering system major divisions within the development code are called articles major divisions within articles are called chapters chapters divide into sections and subsections the format of the divisions in the development code is shown below title 17  land use and development xx  name of xx  name of xxxxx  a references and citations the development code often includes crossreferences to other municipal city documents or state and federal statutes crossreferences and citations of other documents are handled as follows a outside of the same a crossreference is to text outside of the same section being referenced the crossreference starts with a title number ie  followed by the chapter number ie 1 the section number ie 50 and if applicable subsections ie b which are further subdivided by paragraphs ie  for example b refers to paragraph 2 of subsection b of of of title 17 crossreferences will include the applicable title chapter or section number b within the same a crossreference is to text within the same section the crossreference identifies the subsection with the applicable letter ie d followed by a paragraph number ie  for example see subsection d 2 of this section refers to paragraph 2 of subsection d of the same section c external documents the development code references state statues by the name of the applicable state code and specific section numbers eg government  map act  etc the reference will include the abbreviation et seq the latin et sequitur which means and following when the development code also references other sections within the same article or chapter of the relevant state code when those sections relate to the same subject matter for example government et seq refers to of the california government all sections within of the government public hearings d availability of cited documents any external document referenced or cited in the development code are available at the calabasas community development department these documents include the calabasas general plan old town specific plan california government the subdivision map act 3 terms the development code has been written so that it can be easily understood by the general public most terms and phrases shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage except as specifically defined in the development code definitions defines words that have a specific meaning in the development code interpretation of  contains other information on how terms are used in the development code d using the development determining the zoning regulations for a specific site to determine the zoning regulations applicable to a specific property you must first find the site on the calabasas zoning map the zoning map will show the zoning applied to the site and whether the site is subject to any overlay zoning districts or limitations on maximum residential density after determining the sites zoning you use the development code to find regulations applicable to the development of the site a allowed uses and zonebased development standards refer to table 22  land use table in zoning districts and allowable land uses to determine which land uses are possible on the site where the development code provides unique standards and requirements for a particular land use eg day care centers home occupations service stations etc table 22 also list the code section where the specific standards can be found provides standards applicable to specific land uses and activities such as the keeping of animals within the city day care facilities home occupations service stations and others chapters 1713 1714 and 1715 include additional tables describing the basic standards for development in each zoning district the minimum size for lots proposed in new subdivisions  the maximum allowed residential density  maximum floor area ratio  maximum site coverage  minimum setbackyard requirements  and maximum height for proposed structures b additional development standards refer to to find the remaining development standards and regulations applicable to any proposed development or land uses in addition to those established for each zoning district in  to assist with the foregoing each chapter in should be reviewed in the following order i general property development and use standards this chapter contains sections that each cover one topic and that apply to most land use types each section should be reviewed to determine whether it applies to a particular use ii affordable housing this chapter applies to residential development projects proposing five or more housing units iii art in public places this chapter applies to commercial development projects iv landscaping this chapter applies to all land uses and development v parking and loading this chapter applies to all land uses an development vi signs this chapter contains the citys sign ordinance and applies to all land uses and development proposing signs vii oak tree regulations this chapter contains the citys oak tree ordinance and applies to all properties that contain oak trees viii green development standards this chapter applies to commercial development projects with an area over five hundred 500 square feet ix historic preservation chapter contains the citys historic preservation ordinance and applies to all historical resources within the city x reasonable accommodation this chapter provides a process for disabled persons to request reasonable accommodations from existing standards in the development code 2 determining where a specific use may locate a the allowable use table to determine in what zones a specific use may be located review table 22  land use table in permitted conditional temporary and accessory land uses  all zoning districts the left column of the table 22 lists the land uses allowed in each zoning district organized by broad land use types agriculture and open space uses  recreation education and public assembly uses  residential uses  retail trade uses  service uses  and transportation and communications uses under each land use type is a list of the individual land uses that may be allowed in each zoning district the names of the individual land uses are intended to generally describe each use so that the lists do not need to exhaustively itemize every possible land use that may be allowed within the city each land use is then defined in detail in development  with examples of the specific land uses that are included under the general heading each of the middle columns in table 22 covers one zoning district and the rows in the table corresponding to each land use show whether a particular use may be allowed in the zoning district and what permit is required to obtain permission for the use the right column of the table shows whether any unique development code standards apply to the particular land use b using the land use table as mentioned above review table 22 to find the general type of land use applicable to your proposed land use next scroll down the list of specific uses to find your use if your use cannot readily be found try to find a use that looks similar or appears to generally describe your use and then speak with a community development staff member about the process of determination of similar use if your use is not listed in the table for a particular zoning district it is prohibited in that zoning district c checking overlay zone requirements in some cases a site in a particular zoning district may also have an overlay zone applied to it in addition to the base zoning for example a site in the cr commercial retail zoning district could also be located within a scenic corridor and be subject to the scenic corridor design guidelines in this case the zoning map would show the site within the crsc designation d checking specific use standards in some cases the standards for specific land uses in of a sites characteristic eg lot size may have the effect of prohibiting a particular land use for example secondary housing units as shown in table 22 are conditionally allowed in the rs rr and hm zoning districts however the specific requirements for secondary housing units in these units only on parcels with a minimum area of ten thousand 10000 square feet the right column of table 22 will show a section number if the development code provides unique standards for a particular use the listed section should be carefully reviewed to determine whether a particular site and proposed project can qualify for approval purpose and effect of development 01  enactment

evidenced by the survival of characteristics or historic fabric that existed during the resources period of significance only after significance has been established should the issue of integrity be addressed the following factors should be considered when evaluating properties for integrity 1 design any alterations to the property should not have adversely affected the characterdefining features of the property alterations to a resource or changes in its use over time may have historical cultural or architectural significance 2 setting changes in the immediate surroundings of the property buildings land use topography etc should not have adversely affected the character of the property 3 materials and workmanship any original materials should be retained or if they have been removed or altered replacements have been made that are compatible with the original materials 4 location the relationship between the property and its location is an important part of integrity the place where the property was built and where historic events occurred is often important to understanding why the property was created or why something happened the location of an historic property complemented by its setting is particularly important in recapturing the sense of historic events and persons except in a few cases the relationship between a structure and its historic associations is destroyed if the structure is moved 5 feeling feeling is a propertys expression of the aesthetic or historic sense of a particular period of time it results from the presence of physical features that taken together convey the propertys historic character 6 association association is the direct link between an important historic event or person and a historic property a property retains association if it is the place where the event or activity occurred and is sufficiently intact to convey that relationship to an observer like feeling association requires the presence of physical features that convey a propertys historic character for example a revolutionary war battlefield the natural and manmade elements of which have remained intact since the 18 th century retains its quality of association with the battle because feeling and association are subjective criteria their retention alone is never sufficient to support eligibility historical resources must retain enough of their historic character or appearance to be recognizable as historical resources and to convey the reasons for their significance  1272010   calabasas register of historic places city of calabasas resolutions
