federal state or local building and safety codes may require c nonconforming structures 1 expansions a nonconforming structure may be added to or expanded after obtaining a permit from the same permitting authority as that for a new structure if such addition or expansion does not increase the nonconformity of the structure and is in accordance with subparagraphs a and b below in addition the applicant must demonstrate that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of state law and the state of maine subsurface wastewater disposal rules rules or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the laws and said rules a legally existing nonconforming principal and accessory structures that do not meet the water body or wetland setback requirements may be expanded or altered as follows as long as all other applicable standards contained in this met i expansion of any portion of a structure within twentyfive feet 25 horizontal distance of the normal highwater line of a water body tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland is prohibited even if the expansion will not increase nonconformity with the water body tributary stream or wetland setback requirement ii expansion of an accessory structure that is located closer to the normal highwater line of a water body tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland than the principal structure is prohibited even if the expansion will not increase nonconformity with the water body tributary stream or wetland setback requirement iii for structures located less than seventyfive feet 75 from the normal highwater line of a water body tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland the maximum combined total footprint for all structures within that 75foot distance is 1000 square feet and the maximum height of any structure is twenty feet 20 or the height of the existing structure whichever is greater iv for structures located less than one hundred feet 100 from the normal highwater line of a great pond classified as gpa or a river flowing to a great pond classified as gpa the maximum combined total footprint for all structures is 1500 square feet and the maximum height of any

line or 4 upland edge of a wetland must meet the footprint and height limits requirements of c1iii 2 foundations whenever a new expanded or replacement foundation is constructed under a nonconforming structure the structure and new foundation must be placed such that the shoreline setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board basing its decision on the criteria specified in c3 below 3 relocation a nonconforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of state law and the state of maine subsurface wastewater disposal rules or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said rules in no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be more nonconforming in determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the planning board shall consider the size of the lot the slope of the land the potential for soil erosion the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties the location of the septic system and other onsite soils suitable for septic systems and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation when it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure the planning board shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation in addition the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation replanting shall be required as follows a trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree three 3 feet in height for every tree removed if more than five trees are planted no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland than the trees that were removed other woody and herbaceous vegetation and ground cover that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be reestablished an area at least the same size as the area where vegetation andor ground cover was disturbed damaged or removed must be reestablished within the setback area the vegetation andor ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation andor ground cover that was disturbed destroyed or removed b where feasible when a structure is relocated on a parcel the original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses shrubs trees or a combination thereof 4 reconstruction or replacement any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from the normal highwater line of a water body tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland and which is removed or damaged or destroyed regardless of the cause by more than fifty percent 50% of the market value of the structure before such damage destruction or removal may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained within one year of the date of said damage destruction or removal and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the water setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board in accordance with the purposes of this no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its nonconformity if the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure except as allowed pursuant to c1 above as determined by the nonconforming footprint of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location if the total footprint of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a 5 new structure when it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with c3 above any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value or damaged or destroyed by fifty percent 50% or less of the market value of the structure excluding normal maintenance and repair may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained from the officer within one year of such damage destruction or removal in determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the water setback to the greatest practical extent the planning board shall consider in addition to the criteria in c3 paragraph two 2 above the physical condition and type of foundation present if any 5 change of use of a nonconforming structure the use of a nonconforming structure may not be changed to another use unless the planning board after receiving a written application determines that the new use will have no greater adverse impact on the

is superseded by a conforming use may not again be devoted to a nonconforming use except that the planning board may for good cause shown by the applicant grant up to a one year extension to that time period this provision shall not apply to the resumption of a use of a residential structure provided that the structure has been used or maintained for residential purposes during the preceding five 5 year period 3 change of use an existing nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the proposed use has no greater adverse impact on the subject and adjacent
