between men and women or members of the same gender this behavior is unacceptable in the work place itself and in other workrelated settings such as business trips court appearances and businessrelated social events 4sexual harassment affects the victim and other employees as well each incident of harassment contributes to a general atmosphere in which everyone suffers the consequences sexuallyoriented acts or sexbased conduct has no legitimate business purpose where the conduct is directed by a supervisor or someone in a management position toward a subordinate the former will be held to a higher standard of accountability because of the degree of control and influence he or she has or is perceived to have over the employment conditions and benefits of the subordinate bprohibited conduct 1prohibited acts of sexual harassment can take a variety of forms ranging from subtle pressure for sexual activity or contact to physical contact at times the offender

tolerate condone or allow sexual harassment whether engaged in by fellow employees supervisors associates or partners or by outside clients or other nonemployees who conduct business with the city the city supports and encourages the reporting of all incidents of sexual harassment regardless of who the offender may be and will promptly investigate all reported incidents where the alleged offender is not an employee or officer of the city the city administration in consultation with the complainant will review the complaint and make every effort to identify a reasonable remedy if sexual harassment has been confirmed dcomplaint process though the city encourages individuals who believe that they are being harassed to firmly and promptly notify the offender that his or her behavior is unwelcome the city also recognizes that power and status disparities between an alleged harasser and a target may make a confrontation impossible in the event that the informal direct communication between individuals is either ineffective or impossible or even when the communication has occurred the following steps shall be taken to report a sexual harassment complaint 1reporting of incidents all employees are urged to report any suspected sexual harassment to their department head except if that person is the individual accused of harassment in that case the complaint shall be reported to the mayor or an alderman if the victim prefers to report the suspected harassment to someone of the opposite gender from that of the suspected harasser the complaint can be reported to any other elected or appointed individual in a position of authority the report may be made initially either orally or in writing but reports made orally must be reduced to writing before an investigation can be initiated and a resolution achieved 2investigation of complaints when a complaint has been reduced to writing the individual informed pursuant to division d1 above will initiate an investigation of the suspected sexual harassment within five working days of notification the city representative receiving the complaint shall designate another official or employee to assist him or her in the investigation if any of those individuals is the subject of the investigation the investigation will be conducted by the mayor the investigation will include an interview with the employee who made the initial report the person towards whom the suspected harassment was directed and the individual accused of the harassment any other person who may have information regarding the alleged sexual harassment may also be interviewed 3reports the person responsible for investigating the complaint shall prepare a written report within ten working days of his or her notification of the suspected harassment unless extenuating circumstances prevent him or her from doing so the report shall include a finding that sexual harassment occurred that sexual harassment did not occur or that there is inconclusive evidence as to whether or not sexual harassment occurred a copy of the report will be given to the employee who made the initial report the employee to whom the suspected harassment was directed and the individual accused of the harassment 4records confidentiality employees who report incidents of sexual harassment are encouraged to keep written notes in order to accurately record the offensive conduct every effort shall be made to keep all matters related to the investigation and various reports confidential in the event of a lawsuit however the city advises that records that it maintains and that the complainant maintains may not be considered privileged from disclosure written records will be maintained for a period of time as required by the local records act 5time frame for reporting of complaints the city encourages a prompt reporting of complaints so that rapid response and appropriate action may be taken however because of the sensitivity of these problems and because of the emotional toll the misconduct may have on the individual no limited time frame will be instituted for reporting sexual harassment complaints delayed reporting of complaints will not in and of itself preclude the city from taking remedial action 6protection against retaliation the city will not in any way retaliate against an individual who makes a report of sexual harassment nor permit any officer or employee to do so retaliation is a serious violation of this policy and shall be reported immediately any person found to have retaliated against another individual for reporting sexual harassment will be subject to the same disciplinary action provided for sexual harassment offenders 7appeals if a party directly involved in a sexual harassment investigation is dissatisfied with the outcome or resolution that individual has the right to appeal the decision the dissatisfied party shall submit his or her written comments in a timely manner to council edisciplinary action

and including termination to deal with unreasonable conduct or discrimination 2where a hostile work environment has been found to exist the city will take all reasonable steps to eliminate the conduct

structures including precode structures in lots and signs established prior to the effective date of this do not conform to the regulations of this in the zoning districts in which such uses structures lots and signs are located the zoning districts established by this designed to guide the future use of land within the city by encouraging the development or maintenance of desirable residential commercial office and industrial areas with appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses and thus to promote and protect the public health safety and general welfare the continued existence of nonconformities is frequently inconsistent with the purposes for which such districts are established and thus the gradual elimination of such nonconformities is generally desirable b general scope and scheme of regulation separate restrictions are established for nonconforming uses of land and nonconforming uses of structures designed for a permitted use nonconforming uses of structures not designed for a permitted use nonconforming precode structures nonconforming lots of record and nonconforming signs the degree of restriction made applicable to each category of nonconformity is generally related to the degree of incompatibility with permitted uses and the amount of investment typically associated with nonconformities of that type pursuant to of this provision is made for relief from some of the restrictions of this practical difficulties exist in the cases of nonconforming uses of land nonconforming uses in structures designed for a permitted use and nonconforming signs the degree of incapability is frequently great the investment is comparatively small and the economic life is short in these cases elimination of the nonconformity is required after a relatively short but reasonable amortization period in the case of nonconforming uses in structures not designed for any conforming use the degree of incompatibility is also frequently great but so too is the investment and economic life of the structure in such cases while eventual elimination is required a more extended period is allowed in which to amortize the investment while the regulations of this such nonconformities to continue without specific limitation of time they restrict further investment that would make more permanent their location in inappropriate districts c exception for repairs pursuant to public order nothing in this be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of a structure in accordance with an order of a public official
