excessive densities or the development of incompatible land uses either within the development or as the development relates to the general neighborhood the city council may upon proper application approve a planned development to facilitate the use of flexible techniques of land development and site design by providing relief from conventional zoning standards in order to achieve one or more of the following objectives a site planning that better adapts to site conditions and its relation to surrounding properties that would not otherwise be possible or would be inhibited under the district regulations applicable to the property  b functional and beneficial uses of open space areas  c preservation of natural features of a development site  d creation of a safe and desirable living

determination of uses not listed 1 if a particular land use is being requested by a property owner for development within a particular district and that use is not listed in the table then the naics is intended to be the determining source for identifying the type of use by referring to the subsector data from the naics listing to make such determination however the ultimate determination of the permission of a use by right or by special use permit will ultimately be controlled by the provisions of other related chapters of the municipal apply 2 in certain instances the code designation in the table will be indicated as nf this is used in instances where a particular use does not readily translate to the naics system and where the land use is defined in of this table of permitted and

losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of the city of washington missouri hereinafter referred to as the city are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent 1% chance of occurrence in any one 1 year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative

channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood 3 computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height 5 delineation of floodfringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but

cited and referred to as the urban redevelopment  of necessity for legislation ro 1992    effective 312017 it is hereby determined and declared by the council that in certain portions of the city obsolete decadent substandard insanitary or blighted areas exist occasioned by inadequate planning excessive land coverage lack of proper light air or open space defective design or arrangement of buildings lack of proper sanitary facilities or the existence of buildings which by reason of age obsolescence inadequate or outmoded design or physical deterioration have impaired the economic value of large areas infecting them with blight and that such areas are characterized by depreciated values impaired investments reduced or negligible income and consequent tax delinquencies  that such conditions exist in areas where obsolete decadent substandard insanitary outworn or outmoded industrial commercial or residential buildings prevail and the same are conducive to ill health transmission of disease infant mortality  juvenile delinquency and crime  that such conditions occur chiefly in areas which are subdivided into small parcels with multiple ownership and frequently with confusion as to title  that their assembly for purposes of clearance replanning rehabilitation reconstruction and redevelopment is difficult and costly  that the existence of such condition and the failure to clear replan and rehabilitate reconstruct or redevelop these areas results in progressive deterioration in a loss of population by the areas causes a wasteful expenditure of public funds for policing and occasions large outlays for the creation of public facilities and services elsewhere  that it is impossible and uneconomic for individual owners to independently undertake to remedy such conditions  that such conditions require the employment of capital on an investment basis allowing however the widest latitude in the amortization of any indebtedness created thereby  that such conditions further require the acquisition of adequate areas at fair prices the clearance of such areas of existing obsolete decedent inadequate unsafe or insanitary buildings and the redevelopment of such areas under proper supervision with appropriate planning as to land use and construction policies  that the clearance replanning rehabilitation reconstruction and redevelopment of such areas on a largescale basis are necessary for the public welfare and are public uses and purposes for which private property may be acquired by purchase or eminent domain  and that such
