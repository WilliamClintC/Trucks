to address both the present and future special circumstance of the land uses surrounding taylor pond in the past improper land use development caused by the allowance of seasonal and yearround living within the same area the creation of smaller sized lots the erection of summer camps without compliance with a building code the placement of such camps on these small lots in close proximity to each other the use of cesspools holding tanks outhouses and septic tank systems installed under the old percolation test for residential waste disposal the granting of rightofway easements for private roads without defined widths and the long continued use of these roads has resulted in pollution of the pond and present land use problems surrounding the pond with the installation of public sewers it is the intention of the city to ensure that the improper land use development that has taken place in the past will not continue into the future while recognizing that it is impractical to attempt to correct all of the past development mistakes to ensure that public investment in the cleaning up of taylor pond is protected and that where practical past land use practices are not continued it is the policy of the to guide the growth of the land uses surrounding taylor pond which allow for the conversion of summer camps and the erection of new dwellings on private roads provided such buildings are connected to a public sewer and that the applicable city codes are complied with b in permitting the conversion of summer camps and the erection of new dwellings on unaccepted private roads it is

parks and recreation open space dedication will be allocated to the development of facilities located within zones as shown on the recreationalopen space district map made a part of this chapter

medical use of marijuana act codified at 22 mrs  2421 to 2430b the medical act authorizes the possession cultivation and furnishing of medical marijuana to qualifying patients by caregivers as those terms are defined in 22 mrs  2422  and whereas section 401 of the marijuana legalization act codified at 28b mrs ch 1 the adult use act authorizes municipalities pursuant to home rule authority to regulate adult use marijuana establishments including cultivation facilities products manufacturing facilities testing facilities and marijuana stores as those terms are defined in 28b mrs  102  and whereas neither the medical act nor the adult use act nor any state agency rules promulgated thereunder expressly authorize the operation of retail stores by registered caregivers for the purpose of selling medical marijuana or medical marijuana products to qualifying patients hereafter retail medical marijuana caregiver storefronts or the furnishing or sale of marijuana or marijuana products to consumers for onpremises consumption hereafter social clubs  and whereas during the first regular session the 128th maine legislature considered ld 153 an act to amend maines medical marijuana law which if enacted would amend the medical act to expressly authorize the operation of retail medical marijuana caregiver storefronts and ld 238 an act to amend the maine medical use of marijuana act which if enacted would expressly authorize municipalities to regulate registered caregiver operations  however the ultimate disposition of ld 1539 and ld 238 is unknown at this time  and whereas no specific regulations governing social clubs or retail medical marijuana caregiver storefronts exist under the citys ordinances  and whereas the citys ordinances is insufficient to prevent serious public harm that could result from the unregulated siting and operation of social clubs or retail medical marijuana caregiver storefronts within the city  and whereas the unregulated siting and operation of social clubs or retail medical marijuana caregiver storefronts within the city raises legitimate and substantial questions about the impact of such facilities and related uses and activities on the city including questions as to compatibility of such facilities with existing and permitted land uses in the city  potential adverse health and safety effects on the community  the adequacy of the citys infrastructure to accommodate such facilities  and the possibility of unlawful sale of marijuana and marijuana products  and whereas as a result of the foregoing issues the siting and operation of social clubs or retail medical marijuana caregiver storefronts and related uses and activities within the city has potentially serious implications for the health safety and welfare of the city and its residents and visitors  and whereas an overburdening of public facilities and resources including public safety resources is a reasonably foreseeable result of unregulated social clubs or retail medical marijuana caregiver storefronts and related uses and activities located and operated in the city  and whereas the city has established a working group charged with studying reviewing and making recommendations to the city council regarding the regulation of adult and medical marijuana facilities uses and activities including social clubs and retail medical marijuana caregiver storefronts  and whereas the city and the working group needs time to understand the disposition of ld 153 ld 238 and any state department rules promulgated pursuant to the adult use act or the medical act in relation to its own ordinances and to evaluate the effects of social clubs and retail medical marijuana caregiver storefronts and related uses and activities in order to prepare reasonable ordinance provisions governing the siting licensing and operation of such facilities uses and activities  and whereas 30a mrs  4356 authorizes the city to establish a moratorium on the processing or issuance of development permits or licenses  and whereas in the judgment of the city council the foregoing findings constitute a necessity within the meaning of 30a mrs  4356 now therefore be it ordained by the city council of the city of auburn maine as follows 1 moratorium the city does hereby declare a moratorium on the siting operation or licensing of any social club or retail medical marijuana caregiver storefront within the city for purposes of this moratorium these terms shall have the following meanings a social club shall mean any premises where marijuana or
