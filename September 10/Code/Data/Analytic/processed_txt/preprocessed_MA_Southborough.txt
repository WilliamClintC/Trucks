deep observation holes a performed a site examination b witnessed deep observation holes c witnessed percolation tests d approved the proposed sewage disposal plan the purpose of the deep observation hole is to determine the character of the soil in the leaching area and specifically to determine the groundwater elevation and the presence of impervious material on any lot in the area to be used for leaching except as noted below there will be at least two observation holes plus any additional number which in the opinion of the approving authority will be necessary to determine the consistency or lack thereof of the character of the soil the observation holes shall be examined to a depth of at least four feet below the bottom of the proposed leaching facility but in no case shall be lower than 10 feet unless this depth is unattainable because of bedrock etc the groundwater elevation should be determined when the groundwater is at its maximum elevation a exception in cases where three or more contiguous singlefamily uses are being examined at the same time by the same engineer the requirement of two deep observation holes per lot is reduced to one deep observation hole per lot provided that the character of the soils remains consistent in the opinion of the approving authority the deep b  22326 general provisions  22328   22329 percolation test the purpose of

the deep observation holes percolation tests at various elevations may be required by the approving authority observation holes shall be conducted in the area to be used for leaching on each lot at least two percolation tests shall be performed at the site of each disposal area in the soil to be used for leaching additional tests will be required where the soil structure varies or where large

to the atmosphere for more than three days nor shall they be made in frozen soil percolation tests may be performed when the elevation of the soil to be tested is below the frozen soil layer c percolation tests shall not be made in filled ground unless the requirements of  22320 have been made d the minimum leaching area to be installed shall be determined from the following table with the

installed where the percolation rate is slower than 20 minutes per inch 5 soil with a percolation rate over 30 minutes per inch is considered impervious and therefore unsuitable for the subsurface disposal of sewage 6 garbage grinders are not allowed 7 sewage systems to be constructed in fill must be designed according to the percolation rate of the underlying original soil 8 see illustrations a and b on file in the town offices 9 minimum allowable square footage by the southborough board of health is 450 square feet of sidewall area only prepare test hole into the proposed leaching strate within the disposal area of 12 inches in diameter with vertical sides 18 inches deep a establish a fixed point at the top of the test hole from which all measurements can be taken b scratch the bottom and sides of the test hole to remove any smeared soil surfaces either add two inches of coarse sand to protect the bottom from scouring or insert a board or other impervious object in the hole so that water may be poured down or on it during the filling operation c carefully fill the hole with clear water to a minimum depth of 12 inches and maintain the water level by adding water as necessary for the d  22329 general provisions  22330   22331 required depth for pervious material subsurface sewage disposal systems shall be located in an area where there is at least a fourfoot depth of naturally occurring pervious soil below the entire area of the leaching facility the naturally occurring pervious soil shall have a percolation rate less than or equal to 30 minutes per inch or 20 minutes per inch for systems over 2000 gallons per day and the fourfoot stratum must be free of impervious material such as layers of clay silt subsoil or loam  22332 required distances no disposal facility shall be closer than the distances stated to the components listed in the following table the distance shall be increased where required by conditions peculiar to a location purpose of soil saturation but in no case less than 15 minutes after first filling the hole after saturation if the water level drops to a depth of nine inches in less than 30 minutes measure the length of time in minutes for it to drop from a depth of nine inches to a depth of six inches if the rate is erratic in the opinion of the approving authority the hole shall be refilled and soaked until the drop per increment of time is steady the time for the level to drop from a depth of nine inches to a depth of six inches divided by three will be the percolation rate in minutes per inch e if the initial threeinch drop requires more than 30 minutes rate equal to more than 10 minutes per inch the soil shall be saturated by filling the hole to the top and maintaining it full for at least four hours the soil shall then be permitted to swell overnight so that the soil conditions will approach those which exist during the wettest season of the year after the overnight swelling period the test shall be made again by filling the hole to a twelveinch depth and maintaining that level for 15 minutes letting the level drop to nine inches then timing the drop between nine inches and six inches the time elapsed between nine inches and six inches divided by three shall be the percolation rate f in certain soils particularly coarse sand the soil is so pervious as to make the percolation test as described above difficult impractical and meaningless therefore at the discretion of the approving authority the test as described above may be waived and a rate of two minutes per inch can be assumed provided that at least 24 gallons of water is added to the percolation hole within 15 minutes and it is impossible to obtain a liquid depth of nine inches or the percolation rate is faster than 30 seconds per inch
