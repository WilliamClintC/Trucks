nature of variances 1 the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance 2 the variance criteria set forth in this this based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 3 the city should help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are city of grover beach development  flood hazard area use control  so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance must be quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variance shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the commission need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the commission believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 5 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the floodplain administrator that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county of san luis obispo recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land city of grover beach development   flood hazard area use control 6 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency c appeal board 1 in passing upon requests for variances the commission shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in this the a danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners

rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and k costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of

failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and c determine that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 3 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections c1 of grover beach development  flood hazard area use control  c4 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 4 upon consideration of the factors of b1 and the purposes of this the commission may attach
